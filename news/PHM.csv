In addition, the dollar value of the new orders was $6 billion, an increase of 79%""Concerns about rising interest rates and construction costs have been offset by low unemployment and increasing wages, combined with short supply based on years of underproduction of new homes,"" Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said in a news release. ""Demand remained strong as we continued to see pricing power support margins while affordability remained consistent.""Shares jumped 4.9% to 51.61 on the stock market today, but closed off the intraday peak of 53.87 and below their 50-day average.

4,PHM,"Stock indexes turned a deeper shade of red Tuesday as the benchmark 10-year yield stayed just under 3%. Losses in the stock market today sharpened in the afternoon, leaving the bulls with few places to hide.The Nasdaq dropped 1.7% after being up 0.6% early in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.7% also.Small caps, as measured by the Russell 2000, stumbled 0.6%, according to preliminary data. With the exception of the Russell 2000, indexes are trading below their 50-day moving averages.Early data showed volume rose on both major exchanges, pointing to institutional selling.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year yield topped 3% for the first time since January 2014, apparently the cause of selling in recent stock market sessions. The yield is currently 2.99%.At the end of 2017, the yield was 2.41%.Traders now expect more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve than the two more hikes Fed officials had indicated.As the focus shifts to rate hikes, bank stocks initially enjoyed a lift Tuesday. But the bank gains faded either to nothing or to worse than nothing.For example, the money-center banking group was down about 1% after being up 1.2% earlier in the session.Caterpillar (CAT) also reversed from good gains. The stock initially jumped 4.6% but then reversed to a 6% loss.Meanwhile, new-home sales for March delivered a nice beat. The Street's consensus view was for 630,000, up from 618,000 in February. The figure came in at 694,000, a 10% beat.Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) rose more than 6% in the first five minutes of trade. Pulte closed with a gain of nearly 3%.Pulte's earnings soared 90%, topping views by about a third. The stock is battling near the 50-day and 200-day lines.Before Thursday's open the durable goods orders for March will be reported. The Street expects new orders to rise 1.7%, down from 3.1% in February.The first reading on first quarter GDP will be unrolled Friday before the open. Views call for a 2% gain, down from Q4's 2.9% pop.Some market watchers see the stock market as a vehicle of wisdom, but lately the market has acted like a 2-year-old having a tantrum. What could be the cause? There are many possibilities.— ""Sell in May and go away"" could be getting an early start. (Warning: In recent years, this has not been a useful strategy.)— Syria could flame up, though it doesn't look too likely for now.— The fuss surrounding tariffs is quiet, but things aren't likely to stay that way.— Dodd-Frank is posing a stumbling block. The Republicans seem incapable of unity.— The unspoken word is ""infrastructure."" Somehow this project always evolves to being about the border wall.— The 10-year Treasury yield is near 3%, up from 2.41% at the end of 2017. If this is the problem, investors have to wonder why it took so long to get worked up. The biggest move came from year-end to the end of February. Yields, though, have spiked for more than a week to the highest level in four years.Ultimately, investors may never know for sure what is causing the market's trouble. But like a 2-year-old's tantrum, a timeout is often the answer.RELATED:United Technologies Beats ViewsThe Details On Caterpillar's QuarterHow To Find Bullish Chart Patterns

That was much better than views for EPS of 44 cents and revenue of $1.844 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Meanwhile, March new-home sales rose to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

7,PHM,"LGI Homes (LGIH) reported much-better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth early Tuesday. The homebuilder's stock, part of the prestigious IBD 50, already was in a buy zone.LGI Homes earned $1.10 a share, up 115% vs. a year earlier.

8,PHM,"The 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years, reflecting expectations that the Fed will hike its key rate four times in 2018. Stocks, which have struggled as Treasury rates have rallied strongly in recent sessions, sold off sharply yet again.Fed expectations are fluid. Around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the CME Group FedWatch page showed roughly 53% odds of a fourth quarter-point rate hike coming in December, up from one-in-four odds after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.But as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones both closed 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.3%, the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to just below 3% and odds of a fourth Fed hike slipped to 39%.Bank stocks were among the better performers in afternoon trade on the stock market today. But Bank of America (BAC) reversed lower for a 0.4% decline as the market closed, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 0.5%. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are both still below their 50-day lines.Superregional Fifth Third Bank (FITB) surged 4.1% after soundly beating earnings estimates, but was well off session highs. West Coast-based Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) gained 1.4%, extending its recent breakout.Bank stocks can see a big benefit from higher long-term rates if the spread vs. short-term rates widens. But the big move in the 10-year in recent weeks has seen narrowing spreads.While a higher 10-year Treasury means higher mortgage rates for home buyers, housing stocks got a lift initially Tuesday from strong earnings and housing data. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped higher on strong earnings, rising 2.9%, while Lennar (LEN) fell 1.7% and D.R. Horton (DHI) advanced 0.6%.March new home sales rose 4% to a 694,000 annual rate, well above the 630,000 rate expected and not far off November's 11-year high. Also, the Case Shiller 20-City Home Composite Price Index rose 6.8% from a year ago in March, the best gain since June 2014.Still, Tuesday's market action suggests, at least in the near term, that higher market interest rates may pose a hurdle for the S&P 500 and and the stock market generally as it aims to shake off the recent correction.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March. And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting. Fed policymakers who want to move gradually but are concerned about the economy overheating will privately cheer financial markets moving proactively, essentially doing the Fed's work for it.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Not Just Apple: Treasury Yields Hit 4-Year High As Fed, Inflation Fears MountHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomThe Big Picture: Stocks Sputter As Indexes Struggle To Cross This Key LevelLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhile NVR's earnings may have played a role with homebuilders' sell-off Thursday, Wedbush Securities analyst Jay McCanless believes rising Treasury yields are the main culprit.""Historically, the 10-year U.S. yield has influenced the direction of 30-year mortgage rates,"" McCanless said. ""If the 10-year's moving higher, some people are worried that could push mortgage rates higher and reduce housing affordability.""The big drop in the group comes after stocks tumbled when NVR reported weak Q4 earnings in January. The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 181st place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.NVR beat on earnings, which rocketed 57% to $39.34 a share. Analysts had been looking for $31.44. A sharply lower effective tax rate, 13.1% vs. 22.1% a year earlier, boosted the EPS figure.Revenue rose 19% to $1.49 billion, but Wall Street had expected $1.515 billion. New orders increased 17% to 5,174 units, but the average sales price fell 4% to $378,200. This was attributed to a shift to lower-priced markets and homes.Mortgage closed loan production came in at $1.009 billion, an increase of 20%.

10,PHM,"There's no reason to take profits in an emerging leader when it's under accumulation and breaking out from an early-stage base. But after big runs and a series of breakouts, leaders in an industry group invariably start to show signs of wear and tear, mostly due to persistent signs of institutional selling.At some point, savvy fund managers and big investors cash out and rotate into other areas of the market. Recognizing when this happens is key to locking in profits in a big winner.A lot of money was made in the homebuilding group when a multiyear bull market kicked into gear in March 2003. Homebuilders started breaking out from early-stage bases in May — two months after the Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend on March 17, rising 4% in strong volume.After a two-year-plus price run, a wave of institutional selling hit the homebuilder group in the summer and fall of 2005, marking the start of a lengthy downtrend for the group.Several top performers in the group were breaking out from late-stage bases at the time. Pulte Group (PHM) cleared a fourth-stage base in June 2005 (monthly chart is shown below) but institutional selling started to hit the stock a few months later (1). The stock tried to form a new base but failed. By January 2008, Pulte fell 83% from its 48.22 peak.Ryland Group, which is now part of CalAtlantic Group (CAA), tried to clear a fifth-stage base in June the same year, but it suffered the same plight as Pulte. See how the stocks began falling well ahead of signs that the housing market was headed toward a nationwide crisis?Fast forward to 2012 and 2013, and homebuilders regrouped to hold a bona fide leadership role in the market again. If you were fortunate enough to buy Ryland when the shares cleared a first-stage base in late April 2012 and held on for the ride, congratulations.By May 2013, Ryland reached as high as 50.42, up 137% from the April 2012 breakout price of 21.25. Ryland soon peaked and went into hibernation for nearly two years.(Editor's Note: This column was originally published in the May 21, 2013, edition of IBD.

They were the top-performing group in 2017 but sold off starting in late January on poor NVR results.LGI Homes, which went public in November 2013, has enjoyed solid growth over the last year. It made steady gains after breaking out of a 42-week cup with handle at the end of June. It also boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 96, putting it in the top 4% of stocks.Recent housing data had been mixed. New-home sales retreated significantly in December and January on a seasonally adjusted basis while new-home sales unexpectedly dipped in February. However existing-home sales rose in February, the National Association of Realtors said last month.Meanwhile pricing gains are outpacing wage growth, even though the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. A strong labor market increases demand for housing, making the shortage issue even more problematic.Expectations of improved wage gains and continued solid hiring — along with millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the suburbs — should keep demand strong, however.Homebuilders are working to ease the supply squeeze, and the government reported last Friday that in February the number of single-family housing units under construction was at its highest level since June 2008.

26,PHM,"Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) reported much better than expected fiscal first-quarter earnings Wednesday and remains bullish on the housing market. Shares of Lennar and other homebuilder stocks boomed, with several reclaiming key support.Estimates: Wall Street expects EPS to shoot up 46% to 82 cents per share, with revenue increasing 11.6% to $2.652 billion according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Lennar earned $1.11 a share, up 88% vs. a year earlier. Revenue jumped 28% to $2.98 billion. New-home orders rose 30% to 8,456. That includes 1,069 homes from its February acquisition of CalAtlantic.Lennar previously said the Trump tax reforms will reduce its effective tax rate in 2018 from 34% to approximately 25%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We continue to remain positive on the outlook of the housing industry in general,"" CEO Stuart Miller said.Stock: Shares jumped 10% to close at 62.82 on the stock market today, surging back above its 50-day moving average.LGI Homes (LGIH), which leads the Building-Residential/Commercial group, rocketed 8.6% to 71.43, just below a 72.10 cup-with-handle buy point.D.R. Horton (DHI), which leads in annual home sales, rallied 6.4%. PulteGroup (PHM) added 6.35%.

NVR jumped 4.6% on Wednesday to move back above its 50-day line.Recent housing data have been mixed. New-home sales retreated significantly in December and January on a seasonally adjusted basis while new-home sales unexpectedly dipped in February. However existing-home sales rose in February, the National Association of Realtors said last month.Meanwhile pricing gains are outpacing wage growth, even though the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. A strong labor market increases demand for housing, making the shortage issue even more problematic.Expectations of improved wage gains and continued solid hiring — along with millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the suburbs — should keep demand strong, however.Homebuilders are working to ease the supply squeeze, and the government reported last Friday that in February the number of single-family housing units under construction was at its highest level since June 2008.

"
28,PHM,"U.S. stocks remained broadly lower at midday Tuesday in what appears to be a perfectly normal pullback after stunning gains earlier this month. Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week. Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition. However, the sector is also down more than 2% since Jan. 1, so it's actually severely lagging the broader market. See the entire sector rankings via the stock research tables inside IBD Weekly (beginning on page B5) as well as by going to IBD Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.Key earnings reports after the close on Tuesday include Illumina (ILMN), Align Technology (ALGN) and Electronic Arts (EA).Illumina, the expert in genetic data analysis equipment, is expected to post a 44% jump in Q4 profit to $1.22 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 142nd place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.LGI Homes, an IBD 50 member and one of the other builder stocks to retake its 50-day line before Friday, advanced 0.5%.

""We have got a mixed picture on housing from the macro data, so if we get an across-the-board beat from one of the bigger entry-level homebuilders, it could send up stocks in the group as a whole.""Positive comments on pricing trends, such as input costs, would be further catalyst, he added. Another boost for the firm is the fact that housing supply in California has shrunk over the last year, while it also dominates the list of America's least-affordable markets.""KB focuses on California, and a lot of builders are invested in that state. If during the earnings call they have good things to say about California it could also positively impact the group,"" McCanless said.There have already been two positive indications for entry-level demand, he said, namely LGI Homes' strong comparable closing sales in January and February and William Lyon Homes' (WLH) purchase of privately held RSI Communities, which focuses on entry-level buyers.But recent housing data have been mixed. New-home sales retreated significantly in December and January on a seasonally adjusted basis. New-home sales unexpectedly dipped in February, the Commerce Department said Friday.But existing-home sales rose in February, the National Association of Realtors said earlier in the week.The number of first-time buyers tumbled by 31% year-over-year, accounting for 29% of transactions in February. According to realtors and economists, this number should be at 40% for a robust housing market.To make matters worse for buyers, pricing gains are outpacing wage growth, even though the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. A strong labor market increases demand for housing, making the shortage issue even more problematic.Expectations of improved wage gains and continued solid hiring — along with millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the suburbs — should keep demand strong, however, despite the rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage last week nearing a four-year high of 4.46%.Homebuilders are working to ease the supply squeeze, and the government reported last Friday that in February the number of single-family housing units under construction was at its highest level since June 2008.

30,PHM,"A recent tumble in homebuilder stocks is a natural correction that will give way to continued gains despite some mixed quarterly earnings reports, analysts say.X IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group had been a mainstay in the top 10 of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, and had a solid start to 2018 after doubling in 2017. But today, it carries a middling rank of 94 and has fallen 13% from a Jan. 19 high.However, Wedbush Securities analyst Jay McCanless thinks the decline is a natural correction, given the group's stellar performance last year.""The group had a very solid price-appreciation run from September 2017 all the way to year-end so it doesn't surprise me we've seen a bit of a pullback in the group,"" he said. ""Overall outlook is good for 2018. Factors on the ground that drove demand higher in 2017 are still there in 2018.""Demand should continue to be strong, especially in single-family homes, McCanless said. In particular, first-time buyers and empty-nesters looking to move into smaller homes are expected to continue to drive growth, which has already exceeded expectations.""At first in 2017 I don't think people realized how strong demand was from that buyer cohort, and that if anything strengthened during the fourth calendar quarter of 2017, and is giving builders a pretty good tailwind going into 2018,"" he added.Another factor driving growth is competition among mortgage lenders, which include banks and new nonbanking lenders that have entered the market, McCanless said. That has expanded the availability of mortgage credit over the last 18 months and will help feed volume as well as normal demand coming from millennials.Among firms reporting this week, McCanless said D.R. Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM) and M/I Homes (MHO) had exceeded his expectations in terms of order growth and pricing growth. He currently holds a neutral rating on D.R. Horton and PulteGroup and rates M/I Homes as outperform.CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon has been impressed with the discipline shown by builders.""I think homebuilders have done a very good job in terms of expense control, and we are expecting gross margins to improve in 2018"" Leon said. ""Overall the homebuilders, perhaps from lessons learned from the financial crisis, are more conservative in their brand development and are executing better on their existing communities.""Leon rates D.R. Horton as a strong buy and PulteGroup as a buy. He upgraded Meritage Homes (MTH) to a buy from hold following its earnings report Thursday.According to Leon, the Sun Belt has been the biggest area of growth, especially the Southeast, Southwest and California. He marked the Midwest and Northeast as slower markets.Tax reforms also provide a double benefit to homebuilders: They help fuel demand from buyers by putting more money in their pockets, and they free up more capital for homebuilders, who can use the money to expand.""Historically, wage growth is the best leading indicator for housing demand,""  McCanless said. ""As long as jobs numbers continue to do well, that's the most important indicator.""Meanwhile, homebuilders are seeing their tax rate coming down from an average of 38% to around 25%.And McCanless believes firms will be looking to use their boosted coffers to invest and grow.""At this point builders are looking for more land opportunities. I expect that will be the first place they allocate that capital. Investing in the business and growing the business will be the first place they spend the money.Shareholders stand to benefit too, as other excess cash could be returned through dividend increases and share buybacks.Higher labor costs have been a consistent threat, and McCanless does not see this improving anytime soon. ""We just do not have enough workers to meet the demand that's out there.""Material costs have also risen, with lumber and concrete cited as problem commodities, though some firms have been able to absorb the costs due to an increase in the selling price of finished homes.But the biggest threat to homebuilders will be rising mortgage rates, especially if they saw a significant gain in a relatively short span of four to six weeks. Slow and gradual increases will not negatively impact demand, however.The picture was mixed on firms reporting earnings Thursday, with two of the three failing to hit EPS estimates, though all exceeded expectations on revenue.Meritage Homes was the best performer, with its 9.8% EPS rise to $1.34 beating analyst estimates by 9 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue grew 1.3% to $946 million and topped estimates of $934 million. Shares jumped 5.8% to close at 50.20 on the stock market today.M/I Homes' EPS jumped 34% to 90 cents but missed views of $1.04, marking the second quarter in a row it has failed to meet expectations. Revenue climbed 30.7% to $622 million, exceeding views for $592 million. Shares dipped 0.6% to 32.14.M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) also missed EPS estimates, with an 18% drop to 59 cents coming in 6 cents below analyst expectations. Revenue fell 18% to $724 million but edged past estimates of $719 million.The triple-leveraged ETF Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Suppliers (NAIL) finished 0.5% lower Thursday. It plunged through its 50-day line last week after NVR (NVR) missed profit estimates and new-home sales fell more than expected in December.YOU  MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Homebuilder Stocks Continue To Slide On NVR Miss Ahead Of Key Earnings Reports Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

31,PHM,"America's largest home construction company D.R. Horton (DHI) reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings Wednesday amid growing concerns about homebuilding stocks. D.R. Horton jumped at the open, but the stock and those of other homebuilder stocks met resistance at a key level.XD.R. Horton earned 77 cents a share, up 40% vs. a year earlier. That excluded a $115 million charge related to the Trump tax cuts,Revenue climbed nearly 15% to $3.332 billion. Those beat views for EPS of 64 cents and revenue of $3.273 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Net sales orders increased 17% in value to $3.2 billion and 16% in homes to 10,753.D.R. Horton reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 revenue forecast of $15.5 billion to $16.3 billion. Analysts see $16.131 billion. The builder slightly raised its pretax operating margin forecast.Shares jumped more than 5% to 51.24 shortly after the open on the stock market today, just retaking the 50-day moving average, but soon pared gains, closing up just 1.1% at 49.05.The Building-Residential/Commercial group was the top-performing industry in 2017, nearly doubling in value. But D.R. Horton and other home builders tumbled last Thursday, when the sector came under pressure following a disappointing earnings report from industry giant NVR (NVR). NVR shares crashed through its 50-day moving average in massive volume, triggering a clear sell signal. That same day, the Commerce Department said December new-home sales sank more than expected, though they were still up 14% on the previous year.Homebuilding stocks have continued to struggle. PulteGroup (PHM) beat Wall Street earnings estimates Tuesday, albeit narrowly. But shares fell as gross margins fell in the latest quarter, while Pulte suggested they would continue to be squeezed amid concerns over rising labor costs and commodity prices.PulteGroup, like D.R. Horton, rallied back to its 50-day line Wednesday morning, but then reversed. Pulte closed down 2.8%. Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Suppliers (NAIL), a triple-leveraged ETF, also reversed from an early move to its 50-day to fall 3.2%.Eagle Materials (EXP), a building materials firm, tumbled 4.75% Wednesday, crashing through its 50-day line as revenue came in slightly below views.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The Trump tax reform changed the home mortgage interest deduction so it only applies to the first $750,000 of debt, down from $1 million previously. This could potentially hit the high end of the market.But even with the one-time charge and the mortgage deduction capped, CEO David Auld said the tax reforms will have a positive impact, and that he expects it will lead to more demand at the affordable end, which was described as the most underserved segment of the market.""The alternative is rents and if you want to lock in your housing costs, you pretty much got (to buy a) home and build equity,"" Auld said. ""So it's a strong economy, more money in their pockets those are both ramps for D.R. Horton.""Meanwhile, millions of millennials are looking to move to suburban areas after starting families, also fueling demand.And while mortgage rates are rising, with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% this week for the first time in nearly three years Monday, they are still at relatively low levels historically. At least for now, rising rates are fueling a rush to buy, according to Auld.CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon maintained a strong buy on D.R. Horton, with a 12-month target of 59.""As a leader in starter and first move-up homes, we see DHI favorably impacted by tax reform due to its Sun Belt geography not in high tax states and affordable product to more households,"" Leon said in a research note. ""In FY 18, we see DHI realizing strong orders to support mid-teen revenue, 21% gross margins and expense control.""CFRA also raised its EPS estimate for fiscal 2018 by 35 cents to $3.60, and started its 2019 target at $4.15.Thursday is a buy day for homebuilder earnings, with MDC Holdings (MDC), Meritage Homes (MTH) and M.I. Homes (MHO) all issuing results. But they are much smaller builders than NVR, Pulte and especially D.R. Horton.NVR erased gains to retreat 0.85%. MDC was up 1.1%. M.I.

32,PHM,"PulteGroup (PHM) narrowly topped fourth-quarter results, kicking off earnings from several homebuilders this week. But shares continued to stumble, as rising labor and materials costs curb profit margins.X Estimates: EPS was expected to rise to 84 cents a share, with revenue climbing to $2.788 billion up 25% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: PulteGroup earned 85 cents a share with revenue rising to $2.794 billion. That beat Zacks estimates slightly, however some other consensus forecasts had Pulte sales at $2.82 billion. In the equivalent quarter of 2016 they beat EPS estimates by 9%. In revenue the company outperformed expectations by just 0.2%, a drop from the 6.9% on the same quarter of 2016. It had missed Wall Street expectations on earnings in each of the previous three quarters. Demand was strong across the US, including Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, Arizona and California.New orders rose 14% to 4,805 homes and by 22% to $2 billion.However, adjusted gross margin fell to 23.8% vs. 24.9% a year earlier as wages rise and commodity prices climb.PulteGroup also announced a $500 million stock buyback program. It'll be added to its existing plan, which has $94 million remaining.Outlook: Management expects demand in the housing sector to continue to improve with the active adult and entry level markets were cited as growth areas. But Pulte sees margins squeezed further due to increasing labor and material costs, with lumber and concrete highlighted as particular concerns. ""There remain many positive forces pushing the market higher,"" President and CEO Ryan Marshall said during the earnings call. ""Employment trends are favorable and wages are showing signs of growth.""But Pulte sees homebuilding gross margin slipping for a third straight year in 2018, even with home prices continuing to climb.Stock: Shares fell 2.1% to 32.72 in very heavy volume on the stock market today, though off session lows of 31.57.  Pulte tumbled 3.2% on Monday, plunging through its 50-day moving average in above-average trade. The stock has fallen more than 8% since hitting a decade high last week.With a Composite Rating of 90 out of 99, PulteGroup is currently No. 2 in the Building-Residential/Commercial group. The sector had topped all 197 industries that IBD tracks in 2017, and had a solid start to 2018 despite mortgage rates continuing to climb.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.However, weak Q4 results from NVR (NVR) last Thursday raised concerns that the group's long run may be ending.NVR stock crashed through its 50-day moving average and 10-week line in huge volume. Several other builders have also sold off with D.R. Horton (DHI) among those also undercutting their 50-day lines.Across all of its divisions and brands, PulteGroup opened 247 communities in 2017. The business serves all major consumer groups and operates in around 50 major metro markets.In an effort to improve operating and financial performance PulteGroup has been attempting to improve overhead leverage, increase inventory turns and implement new pricing strategies.Demand for housing is strong as millennials start families and look to move to suburban areas. The economy has also been picking up steam. CEO Marshall said it will be another week before the sector enters its spring sales season, when management will be able to get a firmer handle on demand.Headwinds are growing. In addition to rising land and labor costs, the Trump tax reform means that the home mortgage interest deduction only applies to the first $750,000 of debt, down from $1 million previously. That could potentially hit the high end of the market. Mortgage rates are rising with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% Monday for the first time in nearly three years, but they are still at relatively low levels historically.CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon kept a buy rating and price target of 37 on Pulte following the earnings report.""We raise our 2018 EPS estimate by $0.20 to $3.00 and start 2019 at $3.40,"" Leon said in a research note. ""We estimate 19% revenue growth in 2018 with a $4B backlog value and expected 5% to 7% price increase in ASP for homes delivered. We see the 2018 gross margin improving by 100 bp to 24% in 2018 with expense control.""However he added that a risk to sales growth is whether Pulte can add to its 790 home communities.PulteGroup's results lead off a busy week for the sector. D.R. Horton reports Wednesday, followed by MDC Holdings (MDC), Meritage Homes (MTH) and M.I. Homes (MHO). D.R. Horton rallied to close up 0.4%. MDC shed 0.8%, M.I.

34,PHM,"Homebuilder stocks continued to come under pressure Monday ahead of several key earnings reports in the wake of missing fourth-quarter estimates last week.X In 2017, the Building-Residential/Commercial group topped all 197 industries that IBD tracks, nearly doubling in value.  But weak Q4 results from NVR (NVR) last Thursday raised concerns that the group's long run may be ending. Its shares skidded 5.85% to 3,377.35 that day, plunging through its 50-day moving average and 10-week line for the first time in over a year in massive volume, a clear sell signal. NVR shares lost another 3.3% Monday.Several other homebuilder stocks are testing or undercutting key support as well. Five earnings reports this week may tell investors if NVR is an outlier or not.PulteGroup (PHM) fell 3.2% to close at 33.43 on the stock market today, dipping below its 50-day moving average. Analysts expect PulteGroup early Tuesday to report earnings of 84 cents a share, up 25% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should climb 12% to $2.788 billion.D.R. Horton (DHI), which reports Wednesday, sank 4% to 48.32, losing sight of its 50-day moving average after closing below that level last week. The company sees EPS climbing 15% to 63 cents, with revenue rising 13% to $3.273 billion.Reporting early Thursday is M.D.C. Holdings (MDC), which held up against its 50-day moving average line despite Monday's 1.6% drop. The consensus earnings per share among analysts was $0.66, which would be a drop of 8% on the equivalent quarter of 2016. The estimated sales of $719 million would be a drop of 2% on the previous year.Meritage Homes (MTH), which also reports early Thursday, fell 3% after undercutting its 50-day moving average last week. Its consensus earnings per share among analysts is $1.25, which would be up 2% on the equivalent quarter in 2016. The estimated sales of $931 million would be a year-on-year increase of 6%.M.I. Homes (MHO) fell 2.9%, marking its seventh straight loss and falling further below its 50-day line. When M.I. Homes reports late Thursday analysts expect earnings of $1.04 per share, which would be a 55% jump. Sales are estimated to climb 13% to $592 million.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.In addition to Pulte, D.R. Horton and other builders reporting earnings, luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) fell below its 50-day line intraday Monday, down 3.7% for its fifth straight loss.  KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) are approaching their 50-day lines.However in a research note JPMorgan analysts were confident NVR's performance would not be mirrored by other companies in the group.""We do not view these results as a read-through for the other builders and remain comfortable with our outlook for upside to orders and gross margins for the rest of the group this earnings season,"" the research note said.December new-home sales, released Thursday by the Commerce Department shortly after NVR's results, tumbled 9.3% in December to an annual rate of 625,000, far below views for 675,000. But sales were still 14% above a year earlier.Demand is strong as millennials start families and look to move to suburban areas. The economy has also been picking up steam, with job and wage growth solid. Mortgage rates are rising with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% Monday for the first time in nearly three years. But they are still at relatively low levels historically. The financial benefit of owning rather than renting is also a boon for demand.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED INEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

35,PHM,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

36,PHM,"Two homebuilding ETFs find themselves at a crucial juncture, as the once-formidable industry starts showing wear.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are testing their 50-day moving averages. It is the first time the ETFs have pulled back to those levels since they broke out to new highs in September.Both funds own housing-related stocks such as Home Depot (HD) and building materials maker Owens Corning (OC). But iShares Home Construction is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of its holdings in that industry. That helps explain why the ETF's shares have struggled a bit more around the 50-day line than SPDR Homebuilders, which is only 32% invested in builders.If they can bounce from the 50-day averages, the ETFs have a chance to resume their impressive advances. But a drop below the key line could send them further lower. Both ETFs traded tightly in January, but neither was able to move past potential entries. Instead, shares slid.The first signs of trouble appeared Jan. 25, when Lennar (LEN) said the Justice Department had subpoenaed its mortgage unit due to ""quality control processes"" and the underwriting of loans it sold to the Federal Housing Administration.On the same day, December new-home sales came in 9.3% lower at an annual rate of 625,000, below views for 680,000. Also, NVR (NVR) missed sales and profit expectations. Shares plunged below the 50-day moving average, a break of support that had not occurred since the stock's run began in January 2017, a sell signal.Subsequent earnings reports haven't gone so well.On Tuesday, PulteGroup (PHM) narrowly topped fourth-quarter results, but shares continued to stumble. The company fears margins will be squeezed further due to increasing labor and material costs. D.R. Horton beat earnings estimates Wednesday and nudged higher its pretax operating margin forecast. But shares have met resistance at the 50-day line.On Thursday, Meritage Homes (MTH) and MDC Holdings (MDC) were volatile and M/I Homes (MHO) was little changed after those builders reported earnings.IBD's homebuilding industry group nearly doubled in 2017, its best performance in any year, and rose 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. An improving economy and demand from millennials have nurtured the sector's growth.Housing stocks tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan reduced deductions for mortgages and property taxes. Yet, the sector recovered, which offers some hope that the ETFs can recover again. At least some analysts believe the industry is going through a normal correction.However, the weakness in both ETFs caused them to drop out of this month's ETF Leaders screen.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

37,PHM,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales. Merck's results were mixed with $10.43 billion on the top line missing views, but adjusted income of 98 cents per share beat by 4 cents. Amgen (AMGN) reported $5.8 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, lagging the consensus. In merger news, Sanofi (SNY) announced it would acquire Ablynx (ABLX) for $4.8 billion.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell well short of consensus while fellow Dow industrials component Chevron (CVX) also missed EPS views. Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

38,PHM,"The major market averages carried more losses in early trade Tuesday as Amazon.com (AMZN) remained steady in the stock market today. All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average declined over 1%.X Among the Dow Jones industrials, McDonald's (MCD) and Pfizer (PFE) both traded lower after reporting earnings early Tuesday. McDonald's topped Q4 earnings estimates amid strong same-stores sales growth, but shares fell 1.7% and remain above the 50-day line.Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped over 3% despite beating top- and bottom-line estimates. Shares are back in buy range from a 36.88 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares surged to multi-year highs Friday.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple's (AAPL) recent free-fall continued Tuesday with another over-1% decline. Shares have fallen eight of the last 10 days after hitting a new high on Jan. 18. The stock is nearing the 7%-8% loss-cutting level from a 176.34 flat-base entry ahead of Thursday's earnings release.FANG stock Amazon.com announced a new partnership with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan (JPM) that centered around providing health care for their U.S. employees. Amazon fell 0.8% and remains well-extended from a 1,213.51 buy point.Among companies reporting earnings, Polaris Industries (PII) crumbled 11% to pierce its 50-day line in heavy volume. The stock had been battling to stay above a 134.77 flat-base entry since a Jan. 9 breakout, but had trouble clearing the resistance area.Meanwhile, homebuilder PulteGroup (PHM) barely beat the Street's Q4 earnings and sales targets, as the stock fell further under its 50-day line amid a 3% drop.Chip leaders Applied Materials (AMAT) and Nvidia (NVDA) fell about 3% each. Applied is searching for support at the 50-day line, as it etches a handle onto its cup formation. Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains extended from a 218.77 cup-shaped base buy point.Chinese leaders were on the move lower after overnight weakness in the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng index. E-commerce giants Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) fell nearly 3% apiece. Both were falling back into buy range from recent buy points.Alibaba was about 3% above a 191.85 cup-shaped base entry, while Leaderboard name JD was about 2% above a 47.50 cup-with-handle entry.Inside the IBD 50, only a handful of names were trading in positive territory amid the market's sell-off. Among the day's losers was Grubhub (GRUB). The food delivery service dropped 5% — just two days after breaking out above a 74.91 flat-base entry.

39,PHM,"Stock fell out of the starting gates Tuesday, as global markets suffered another day of losses and a new partnership announced by Amazon.com (AMZN) rattled stocks across the U.S. health care fields.XThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.7% as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and ExpressScripts (ESRX) put up heavy losses.The S&P 500 traded down 0.6%. and the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped nearly 0.8%, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) down hard and Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) and Chevron (CVX) among the half-dozen other Dow Jones names clocking early losses of greater than 1%.International markets were also posting losses, as bond markets remained under pressure and the dollar continued its slide. Leading benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Stocks in Europe also showed deepening losses in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX diving furthest, each down 0.8%.The Federal Open Market Committee swings into its two-day meeting in Washington Tuesday morning — the last FOMC gathering over which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will preside. A policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, though no rate hike is expected this time around.Other economic news for the day is thin, with the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for November rising 0.7%. That was unchanged from October's reading, and just above consensus views for a 0.6% gain. The January consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board expected at 10 a.m. ET.Health-care stocks were reacting briskly to news that Amazon would partner with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to chart out new ways to provide health care for their U.S. employees, ""through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""The deal suggested that the ""Amazon effect"" — the impact of deep pockets and massive online scale the company brings to its efforts — could begin to assert an impact on health care and insurance industries, the way it has on retail, shipping and other markets.Amazon dropped 1.3%, JPMorgan slipped 0.9% and Berkshire Hathaway was flat. Amazon shares are extended, almost 17% above a 1213.10 buy point following a breakout in early January.On the Dow, UnitedHealth Group dove nearly 5% in opening action.  Other managed care providers responded similarly, with Anthem (ANTM) down 5%, Cigna (CI) sliding 5%, while Aetna (AET) slipped 3% and Humana (HUM) subtracted more than 2%.Shares also dived among pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chains, with Express Scripts careening 9% lower to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. CVS Health (CVS) crumbled nearly 5%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) fell 5% each.Apple traded down 1%, as news reports detailed the company's plans to reduce production for its iPhone X through March 31. Some reports said this was on weaker-than-expected demand, others said the move was seasonal and occurred around this time each year. Apple spent a third session below its 10-week moving average on Monday, and starts Tuesday in a test of its prior low, from early December — just ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday.Early earnings reports were also a factor in early trade, with McDonald's (MCD) down 1.1% after its fourth-quarter report. Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) dropped almost 3% after its quarterly results.Life insurer MetLife (MET) tumbled 8% after announcing late Monday it would postpone its fourth-quarter earnings report as the company wrestles with a foul-up that potentially left ""tens of thousands"" of workers without monthly pension benefits. The company said it would increase reserves by $525 million to $575 million in order to deal with the problem, and revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the matter.Maxim Integrated dived nearly 7%, reversing much of Monday's 12% gain that followed news reports the company was a possible takeover target for Japanese rival Renesas for $20 billion. In reports after Monday's close, Renesas denied that it was in takeover discussions with Maxim.Callidus Software (CALD) spiked 10% at the open, after announcing German software giant SAP (SAP) would acquire the company for $2.4 billion. Dublin, Calif.-based Callidus operates as CallidusCloud, which provides cloud-based sales and marketing programs.

42,PHM,"LGI Homes (LGIH), NVR (NVR), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Lending Tree (TREE) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) had a terrific 2017 — and so did the industry groups of which these winning stocks form a part.X The top industry groups of 2017 include homebuilders, video game makers, mortgage firms and trading brokerages. Meanwhile, apparel and shoe retailers, coal producers and oil-and-gas drillers enjoyed a year-end burst of performance. Momentum in those groups is worth watching into 2018.LGI Homes and NVR have surged 161% and 102% this year, while homebuilding peers KB Home (KBH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) have fared almost as well, with gains ranging from 81% to 102%. They are benefiting from pent-up millennial demand as well as broad strength in the economy.The residential/commercial-building industry group, as a whole, soared 99.4% for the year and 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. But headwinds loom.The housing sector tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan set a cap on deductions for mortgages and property taxes. It has recovered since, but critics maintain the cap knocks back homebuilding and housing-related companies by making homeownership less affordable.Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard soared 123% and 75%. Video game publishing peers Nintendo (NTDOY), NetEase (NTES), Zynga (ZNGA) and Electronic Arts (EA) follow, with gains of 74%, 60%, 56% and 33% respectively.The stocks have gained ground as the industry shifts to higher-margin digital distribution and looks for opportunities to monetize downloadable content. Esports, or professional video game competitions, are seen as another long-term growth driver.The gaming software industry group gained 78.7% this year, despite a 1.2% retreat in the fourth quarter.Lending Tree skyrocketed 236% higher, while Essent Tree (ESNT), CoreLogic (CLGX) and HFF Inc. (HF) boast gains ranging from 70% to 25%.These mortgage and mortgage insurance providers benefit, as homebuilders do, from housing's growth and strength in the sector. Essent expects robust expansion of the housing market over the next few years.The mortgage and related financial services group has risen 70.9% for the year and 17.6% in the final quarter of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""Interactive Brokers jumped 62% this year.

43,PHM,"It's been a fantastic year for homebuilders, ranked among the top industries since May. That's made winners of a couple of ETFs, although one is well ahead of the other.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are both in IBD's ETF Leaders screen. Yet, neither is a pure-play homebuilding ETF, and the two funds are structured quite differently.That helps explain why iShares U.S. Home Construction has sharply outperformed, up about 57% this year compared with about 31% for SPDR S&P Homebuilders.SPDR Homebuilders (which holds 35 stocks) is only 33% invested in builders, while iShares Home Construction (with nearly 50 holdings) is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in those companies.Both also have a good share of building products companies: 33% for SPDR Homebuilders and 15% for iShares Home Construction. The rest of the portfolios consist of home furnishing, home improvement (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), appliance and other companies related to the housing industry.The heavier reliance on homebuilders has indeed helped iShares U.S. Home Construction put up better returns in 2017.For example, D.R. Horton (DHI), which makes single-family homes in 26 states, has surged more than 35% from a breakout to new highs on Sept. 12. D.R. Horton is the largest holding in the iShares fund, with a 13.2% weighting. By comparison, the same stock occupies 4.4% in SPDR Homebuilders, which equal-weights its holdings.Because of that structure, winning homebuilding stocks have about the same weighting as fund laggards such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Both funds own the other major homebuilders that have rallied this year, such as Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Bros. (TOL) and CalAtlantic (CAA).Chartwise, both ETFs formed three-weeks-tight patterns in the first half of December and are trading close to possible buy points. For iShares Home Construction, the entry is at 44.09 and for SPDR Homebuilders 44.59. The primary risk is in the lengthy advance both ETFs have enjoyed this year.The new tax bill cuts the amount of mortgage interest homeowners can deduct on their taxes, a measure that particularly hit luxury-home builder Toll Bros. But with the U.S. economy trending higher, many analysts maintain a positive outlook.""The National Association of Home Builders' index was released and it indicated that developers are near giddy,"" economist Joel L. Naroff wrote in a note Tuesday. ""The index is now above every reading we saw during the housing bubble.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

44,PHM,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation. The buy point is 144.45. The stock ended Thursday's session 2% below the entry.RELATED:Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsIncome Investing: How To Find The Best Dividend Stocks

52,PHM,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000. Amazon edged up 0.3%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) rose 0.7%, and drug distributor McKesson (MCK) dipped 0.1%. CVS Health (CVS), which also has a PHM unit, added 0.3%.UnitedHealth is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, behind Centene (CNC) and Cigna (CI), based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene rose 3.2% and Cigna 1.2% Tuesday, helped by a bipartisan deal to fund ObamaCare subsidies for insurers.IBD'S TAKE: Get ready for each earnings season day by reading IBD's daily Investing Action Plan, which highlights stocks that are in buy range or close to it. UnitedHealth's EPS surged 23% to $2.66, beating views for $2.57, as revenue climbed 8.7% to $50.322 billion, matching forecasts. Optum revenue rose 8.4% to $22.89 billion.The company raised its guidance for full-year earnings to about $10 per share vs. its prior range for $9.75-$9.90. Analysts had expected $9.87.Because the insurer has extricated itself from the ObamaCare exchanges and GOP efforts to target Medicaid have run into trouble, it's well positioned to deal with shifting political winds.In fact, UnitedHealth markets the type of short-term medical plans that Trump wants to make widely available as a less-costly alternative to ObamaCare plans.Management noted on the earnings call that they'll consult with the Trump administration as officials write rules governing short-term plans and other areas targeted by Trump's executive order last week.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

"
55,PHM,"In the stock market, focusing on high-quality names going up in price is generally better strategy than targeting the weak price performers, which in many cases are being sold because of deteriorating fundamentals.So what's the best way to identify the market's strongest price performers?IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating (RS Rating) is your ticket. It ranks stocks on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 being the best. A stock with an RS Rating of 99 means it has outperformed 99% of the stocks in IBD's database based on 12-month price performance.The general rule of thumb is to target stocks with RS Ratings of 80 or higher. It's not a steadfast rule, but it's generally a good pond to fish in when looking for strong-performing growth stocks.Stock screens like the IBD 50, Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight and IPO Leaders are loaded with strong price performers with several other compelling traits as well.When it comes to slower-moving, large-cap stocks, it's OK to be a little more lenient with the RS Rating. Dow component Intel (INTC), for example, has been moving sideways since late January, hurting its recent RS Rating of 66. But big buyers have been in the stock lately, though, as the chip giant is in the early stages of breaking out of a flat base with a 38.55 entry.Homebuilders have been showing high relative strength for some time now. Just recently, the group was up about 63% year-to-date, compared to a 13% gain for the S&P 500. No surprise, then, to see multiple names in the group with high RS Ratings. Leaders in the group like D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) recently boasted RS Ratings of 88 and 86, respectively.Meanwhile, airline stocks have been lagging the market. Year-to-date, the group is down 12% year-to-date. Bright spots in the group include Brazil-based Gol Intelligent (GOL) and SkyWest (SKYW). Both have high RS Ratings but are extended past proper buy points. More widely known names in the group, such as Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU), have been showing middling price performance at best, with recent RS Ratings of 20 and 19, respectively.Barracuda Networks (CUDA)  offers another example of how sideways and lagging price action can hurt the RS Rating, which is now at 57. Barracuda has doesn't much since hitting a high of 26.69 about a year ago. Shares were recently trading around 24.39.But using the RS Rating isn't as easy as buying all the 99-rated stocks, thinking they're slam dunks for outperformance in coming months. Sometimes, that is the case, especially when a high RS stock is building a base and poised for a breakout.But stocks with high RS Ratings can also be well extended past proper buy points and too late to buy. In the accompanying table, YY Inc. (YY) continues to show outstanding price strength, but it's extended from an 83.10 buy point. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also owns an outstanding RS Rating. The carmaker is trading tightly near highs after a breakout over an 11.75 buy point. Tight weekly closes after a breakout often yield additional entry points.Buying an extended stock is an easy way to lose money quickly in the stock market. The trick is to find stocks with high RS Ratings that haven taking a breather and moving sideways after a nice run. Those that correct the least tend to hang on to strong RS Ratings.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And WatchFree Access To IBD Premium ContentWhen To Sell Stocks: Is Your Stock ""Living"" Under The 10-Week Moving Average?When To Sell Stocks II: Big Breach Of The 50-Day Moving Average Is A Key Sell Signal

58,PHM,"Toll Bros. (TOL), a builder of luxury homes, easily topped fiscal Q3 profit estimates but revenue performance was mixed and full-year guidance was light, sending shares down sharply.Estimates: EPS to increase 9.7% to 68 cents, with revenue rising 16.5% to $1.48 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting EPS of 69 cents on revenue of $1.51 billion.Results: EPS of 87 cents on revenue of $1.5 billion. Net orders rose 24% to 2,163 units. Average price edged up 0.8% to $837,300. Backlog climbed 21% to 6,282 units. Adjust gross margin narrowed to 25% from 25.3%. Homebuilding deliveries jumped 26% to 1,899 units.Outlook: Q4 deliveries of 2,275-2,575 units and full-year deliveries of 7,000-7,300 units, up from a prior guidance of  6,950-7,450 and translating to full-year revenue of $5.6 billion-$6 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus for $5.92 billion.The company is selling through some communities more quickly than anticipated and now expects to end FY 2017 with between 300 and 310 selling communities. About 150 homes that would've been delivered this fiscal year are now anticipated next fiscal year due to a recall from a major lumber manufacturer.""The unemployment rate is at a 15-year low, the economy is growing, the stock market is strong, and home prices continue to rise, putting equity in the pockets of those who may want to sell their existing home and move to a new one,"" said CEO Douglas Yearley in a statement. ""New home prices are significantly outpacing existing home prices.""Stock: Shares closed down 2.6% at 37.27 on the stock market today, undercutting the low end of a flat base with a 41.17 entry and triggering a sell signal.IBD'S TAKE: D.R. Horton provided IBD's SwingTrader with a nice gift after it was added on July 7. It was part of a bullish move among homebuilders while the market was trying to find its footing after the Nasdaq composite breached its 50-day moving average for just the second time this year.Single-family home starts have fallen in four of the last five months, according to Commerce Department data, as the industry faces labor and lot shortages. But homebuilders are still bullish on a strong job market as still-low interest rates boost sales.Last month, D.R. Horton (DHI), Tri Pointe Group (TPH) and M/I Homes (MHO) reported better-than-expected earnings, following mixed results from rival Pulte Group (PHM).RELATED:Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsIBD Rating Upgrades: TRI Pointe Flashes Improved Price StrengthHomebuilder Stock Retests Buy Zone, Gets IBD Rating Upgrade

59,PHM,"On Thursday, Pulte Group (PHM) hit an important technical benchmark, with its Relative Strength (RS) Rating jumping into the 80-plus percentile with an improvement to 84, up from 80 the day before. X IBD's unique rating measures price performance with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The rating shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. History shows that the best-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating of at least 80 in the early stages of their moves.Pulte Group has climbed more than 5% past a 23.89 entry in a first-stage cup with handle, meaning it's now out of a proper buy zone. Look for the stock to offer a new buying opportunity like a three-weeks tight or pullback to the 50-day or 10-week line. The company posted 27% EPS growth last quarter, while sales growth came in at 12%. Pulte Group earns the No. 2 rank among its peers in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group. NVR (NVR) is the top-ranked stock within the group.RELATED:IBD Stock Rating Upgrades: Rising Relative StrengthWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

60,PHM,"Top-rated homebuilder stocks KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR), MDC Holdings (MDC) and Pulte Group (PHM) all made IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Such institutional demand helps drive industry group rankings, so it's no wonder the Building-Residential Commercial group currently comes in at No. 8 among the 197 groups IBD tracks.While LGI Homes (LGIH) didn't make the latest list, it's also seen heavy institutional buying, as indicated by an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.4 Up/Down Volume Ratio. The stock closed higher for the 10th straight week, up nearly 8%.Tracking which stocks the top fund managers are buying is one key way to build a quality watch list. While it's no guarantee the stock will go up, it's a positive sign to know a mutual fund's research team and portfolio managers have done their due diligence and decided to invest.The table below shows how these leading homebuilder stocks stack up in terms of indicators that help you gauge institutional demand.After breaking past a 23.71 entry in a cup with handle, Pulte group is now extended, meaning it's more than 5% above the buy point and therefore out of a proper buy range.LGI Homes, NVR and KB Home are also extended, but the latter may be forming a new base.MDC broke out on June 28, but has seesawed in and out of the buy zone since then. It's now struggling — and so far failing — to find support at its 10-week moving average.Retaking that benchmark line in heavy volume would be a sign that fund managers and other large investors are stepping in to protect or add to their positions.Each of these companies recently reported earnings, except for LGI Homes, which is expected to release its latest quarterly numbers before the market open on Aug. 8.Analysts are looking for a 32% gain in earnings for the second quarter, compared to a 9% decline in earnings growth in Q1.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Top Fund Managers Buying – And Selling?Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

61,PHM,"In an odd year for the homebuilding trade, most of the big-name builders have reported their quarterly results, and the housing market continues to struggle like a big dog on a leash.While no homebuilding stocks are currently listed on either the IBD 50 or the Sector Leader lists, a total of five homebuilding names have earned a spot on IBD's Your Weekly Review list: KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH), M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) and Toll Brothers (TOL).Your Weekly Review (see it in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com) casts a slightly broader net for leading stocks, in terms of the vetting process, when compared to the other two lists. The process often turns up gems, but these must be researched with a bit more diligence that the more stringently screened Sector Leaders or IBD 50.Homebuilders stocks absolutely fit that profile.The 25 stocks collected in the homebuilding group turned in a collective gain of more than 48%  for the year through Friday. That has earned the stocks a steady top 10 ranking over the past 13 weeks among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Track industry group charts and ratings like a pro using IBD's MarketSmith: a pro-grade arsenal of investment research programs and data. Also, see this Investor's Corner column on how to employ MarketSmith to spot early signs of large sector rotation and catch new breakouts among emerging growth companies.But the industry is turning in confusing data.Lennar (LEN) has now posted two quarters of earnings declines (-75% and -4%) despite accelerating revenue growth. Pulte Group (PHM) reported that earnings growth rebounded in its first and second quarters (from 18% to 29% and 27%), while revenue growth slowed (from 21% to 14% and 12%).The industry's largest name, D.R. Horton (DHI), reported that both sales and earnings growth slowed in its fiscal third quarter and its gains in new orders eased to 11.3% in a second-straight quarterly decline.M.D.C. Holdings reports Tuesday morning. LGI reports next Monday, and Toll Brothers has not yet announced a date for its fiscal Q3 report.The National Association of Realtors on Monday released stronger-than-expected numbers for pending home sales — houses under signed contracts, a gauge of upcoming sales activity for existing homes — in June. The more critical numbers to homebuilding stocks are sales of new homes.June new-homes sales inched up 0.8%, but growth was revised lower in March, April and May. Housing starts bounded 8%, building permits jumped 7% — both strong gains, but with the overall numbers remaining far below levels expected from a healthy market.We should be building total housing starts to 1.2 to 1.4 million, and we are only running at about 1.15 to 1.185 million,"" said analyst Jade Rahmani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""So there is about a 100,000-to-300,000-unit cushion of potential undersupply.""Why? Competition for limited land and labor is constraining the construction industry's output. At the same time, costs are rising — not just for labor and land, but for materials and services, including Canadian lumber, on which import tariffs of up to 24% were slapped in April, with another round reportedly on the way.The environment favors big homebuilders, Rahmani says.""We think the public homebuilders can take market share from privates, because they have better access to capital, and they can just tack onto their existing communities,"" he said.Rahmani favors Lennar and D.R. Horton over small- to mid-cap builders. These ""have the potential to face margin pressure as a result of increasing land costs and increasing building materials costs and labor inflation,"" Rahmani said.But recent gains in market shares have generally taken place below the level of the top 10 largest national builders, says Robert Dietz, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders.""There has been some growth (in market share) among the top 20 share or the top 100 share,"" he said. ""The top 10 share has been roughly constant at about a quarter of home sales.""Results from small-cap builders M.D.C. and LGI Homes could be telling. Chartwise, M.D.C. remains in play after a brief breakout above a 36.09 buy point in a six-week flat base. Shares pulled back below the buy point, but stopped short of the 7% to 8% level that would trigger the automatic sell rule.The stock did break below its 50-day moving average in above-average volume. That is a sell signal, but not a hard-and-fast sell rule. That means the stock remains in play. A move back above the 36.09 level in heavy trade would mark a buy opportunity.Shares of LGI are extended after a third rebound from 10-week support since a breakout from a cup base in January.The Commerce Department reports July housing starts and building permits data on Aug. 16, and July new home sales numbers on Aug. 23.RELATED:Spotlight Countdown: 4 Buy Points, 3 Earnings Reports On The WayThis Homebuilder Wins By Wooing New Entrants To HomeownershipNo. 2-Ranked Homebuilder Constructs Successful BreakoutThese IBD 50 Leaders Are Basing As Earnings Come Due

D.R. Horton is technically within the top of a buy range, but a high-volume sell-off would not be encouraging.D.R.

65,PHM,"XThe stock market surged higher in relief at midday trading Monday after the results of the French presidential election Sunday. Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron outperformed Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front party, raising hopes that France will remain a member of the European Union. Round 2 between Macron and Le Pen will be on May 7. Among the Dow industrials, financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) were the runaway leaders, surging over 3% each. Both global banks remain below their 50-day moving averages, however, as they work on their respective bases. Among nonfinancial components, Caterpillar (CAT) advanced 2.6%. Shares are approaching a 99.56 flat-base entry.Only three stocks traded in negative territory, Verizon (VZ), Wal-Mart (WMT), and Disney (DIS). Shares of Verizon fell further under their 200-day as they approach their 52-week low, while Wal-Mart briefly notched a new high before retreating 0.4%.

Among stocks breaking out today, home improvement stores Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Companies (LOW) both emerged above buy points in early trading. Home Depot leapt above a 150.25 flat-base entry, while Lowe's briefly surpassed its flat base's 84.10 buy point before faltering.On the downside, homebuilders drastically underperformed heading into midday trading.

All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday.

Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion. On Monday, Caterpillar reported that equipment sales by retailers rose 1% in the three months to March vs. a year earlier, the first such gain since November 2012.Caterpillar shares rose 2.6%, to 96.81, on Monday, retaking their 50-day line and approaching a 99.56 flat-base buy point.The defense contractor should report an 8% revenue rise to $1.24 billion with EPS also up 8%, to $2.79. Lockheed Martin rose 1.1%, to 276.21, on Monday, still in range from a 270 buy point retaken last week.Defense stocks have rallied on hopes for higher U.S. military spending and increased geopolitical tensions with Syria and North Korea.

Volume rose modestly on the NYSE, but edged lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday. Among the Dow industrials, American Express (AXP) boosted the blue-chip index with a near 5% jump after reporting its Q1 earnings late Wednesday. The credit card company cleared both earnings and sales estimates, causing shares to surge back above the 50-day line.

Horton (DHI) traded down over 2.3% despite beating fiscal Q2 estimates and raising its full-year revenue guidance early Thursday. D.R. Horton broke out of a cup with handle with a 34.16 entry on Monday, but is now trading below that point. Other homebuilders followed suit. Pulte Group (PHM) reversed from highs to move down 1.7%, while Toll Brothers (TOL) dropped almost 1%.Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 0.6% after reporting its Q2 fiscal results late Wednesday. The wireless chip maker reported better-than-expected sales and earnings, but guided analysts lower for the current quarter. The bearish guidance caused a number of price-target cuts from analysts. Shares are down 20% year-to-date. Starbucks (SBUX) jumped out of a flat base with a 59.64 entry in the stock market today. The coffee maker was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel. Stifel expects the company to report strong same-store sales growth in the coming quarters.

Horton (DHI), Toll Brothers (TOL) and Pulte Group (PHM) opened 1% lower.Fiber-optic telecom gear maker Finisar (FNSR) spiked 10% in early trade.

Steel Dynamics (STLD) rose 3.5% as it builds the right side of a base. United States Steel (X) retook a 39.24 buy point. Both are third stage bases, which are more prone to fail than first- or second-stage breakouts.Among the steel alloys, Carpenter Technology (CRS) tried but failed to retake a 42.37 buy point. Carpenter's consolidation is first stage.Bank stocks appeared re-energized. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up to a 3.5% gain in brisk volume.

President-elect Trump has pledged tax cuts, regulatory reform and an infrastructure spending blitz that could boost economic growth and inflation, pushing Treasury yields higher.Demand for loans to buy a home dipped 2% over the last two weeks of 2016, and were off 1% vs. a year earlier. But purchase applications are still up nearly 16% since the week ended Nov. 11, which largely included pre-election responses.IBD'S TAKE: A key question for the housing industry in 2017 is how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be. Policymakers have signaled three rate hikes this year, but the Fed may play traffic cop as President Trump hits the gas.The average fixed-rate mortgage fell 6 basis points to 4.39% in the latest week, but is still up from 3.75% in the week ended Nov. 4. The prior week's 4.45% was the highest in two-and-a-half years.Many prospective buyers may be rushing to buy a home while rates are still historically low. But the rush may be fading as higher rates and still-rising home values take their toll on housing affordability, especially millennials.In addition to the recent dip in purchase applications, the Pending Home Sales Index unexpectedly fell to a 10-month low in November, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Other data, including new- and existing-home sales showed increases, with the latter hitting their best levels since before the housing bust. But those reports may not be as timely as the pending sales or the mortgage applications.On the upside for housing demand, job growth continues at a modest pace with indications that wage gains are starting to pick up.Shares of homebuilders, including KB Home (KBH), Toll Bros. (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), Pulte Group (PHM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) rallied on the stock market today in afternoon trading.KB Home rose 3.6% and Toll Bros 2%.

""Already faced with climbing home prices and minimal listings in the affordable price range, fewer home shoppers in most of the country were successfully able to sign a contract.""The pending homes gauge tracks contract signings of existing homes. They foreshadow actual existing-home closings in the next month or two.Other housing reports have been relatively strong, but that could reflect less timely data or buyers rushing to lock in rates.Existing-home sales edged up in November to their best level since 2007, but those sales likely were signed in October or even September. New-home sales, which are more timely, jumped to their best second-best level of the recovery, with many analysts crediting a rush to buy. Mortgage applications for buying a home actually increased after Election Day, which triggered a big spike in mortgage rates.Home builder confidence is high despite those higher rates, with the NAHB Housing Market Index spiking to an 11-year best in December.Shares of homebuilders fell after the pending home sales data and the general market retreated. Toll Bros.

New-home sales are more timely.Mortgage applications for buying a home actually rose significantly after the presidential election, which sent mortgage yields flying.With job growth steady and wage growth generally trending higher, housing demand should stay solid. But some of November's gain in home sales and mortgage applications may reflect Americans rushing to buy a house before rates rise even further.Sales in the Midwest skyrocketed 43.8%, while sales in the West rose 7.7% to their best pace since January 2008.

116,PHM,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

125,PHM,"Some stock mutual funds have done better than most since the market's post-Brexit vote rally began. A whole lot better.The United Kingdom vote on June 23 to leave the European Union sparked a sharp global sell-off. In the rally that's followed, the broad stock market in the form of the S&P 500 is up nearly 8%, but the 10 best performing U.S. diversified stock funds are up 13% to 20%.What's their secret? The top performers are nearly all small- and midcap funds. They've been riding a small-cap surge. Since June 27, the small-cap Russell 2000 index has risen nearly 14%. So has the Nasdaq composite. But the S&P 500 trails with an 8% gain.Much of top-performing funds' power came from stocks that have been around, with some being known growth stocks, like Nvidia (NVDA), Gibraltar Industries (ROCK) and Pulte Homes (PHM). Yet some are more obscure and still mired in losses, though their financial health is improving.None of the top-performers have strayed from their stated investment strategy to fetch their outsized gains. Each has done well by sticking to its own long-term investment approach. None made big U.K. or eurozone plays, according to several of the top-10 managers who spoke with Investor's Business Daily.Instead, outperforming funds benefited from rebounds by stocks that had been out of sync with a largely defensive market. Many had been rallying since February.

""The market changed.""In some segments, that improvement had begun weeks or months earlier.Shapiro got a boost from John Bean Technologies (JBT), up 17% post-Brexit. Gavin Baker, manager of $13.4 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX), got a lift from Nvidia, up 36%. Jeff James, manager of $314 million Driehaus Micro Cap Growth (DMCRX), found rock-solid support in Gibraltar Industries, which climbed 28%.The $671 million Legg Mason Opportunity (LMOPX) led the outperformance parade. The fund is up nearly 20% since Brexit.Investors snapped out of their panic as they realized macro economic data, especially in the U.S., was encouraging. ""A lot of positive U.S. data was already becoming apparent,"" said Jeff James, manager of Driehaus Micro Cap Growth. The outlook for corporate earnings was also improving.That enabled many investors to focus on individual company fundamentals.IBD'S TAKE: Learn how to invest in stocks while protecting your capital at investors.com.Now, what looks positioned to do well going forward?Shapiro says many health care and biotech names remain beaten down. Drug and device pricing has become a political target. He favors health care names that do not appear politically vulnerable to pricing controversy.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.Evolent Health (EVH) is a health care software and consulting services company. One key service Evolent provides is data analysis that aims to help hospitals improve quality while cutting costs.""They've generated good numbers and signed a lot of partnerships,"" Shapiro said. Still, the company expects to lose money this year and next.The stock's Comp Rating is a decent 89.Opportunity co-manager Bill Miller has had above-average exposure to housing for a number of years. That worked well for the fund in 2012-13, went sideways in 2014-15 and hurt the fund early this year, he says.Pulte Group is a multiyear holding that still has many years of growth left, he adds. As evidence, he cites the fact that housing starts are still below their historical norms. Also, Pulte's share price is still below where it was 10 years.The stock has a very strong 96 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: See what makes LGI Homes, another homebuilder, the No. 1 stock in the building-residential/commercial industry group with IBD's Stock Checkup.James says one of the themes he is playing is: components for optical networks. The expansion of communication networks' bandwidth creates a need for components that can carry increasingly large amounts of data.""This is creating strong demand, which is a function of strong demand out of China,"" he said. He also cited increased demand from cloud computing networks. And the demand for components is a multiyear cycle, he says.""Oclaro (OCLR) is a component company seeking rising earnings and margin expansion,"" James said. ""They are seeing strong demand from China and from the U.S.""With a 99 Comp Rating, Oclaro has enjoyed accelerating EPS growth of -200%, 86%, 133%, 133% and 283% the past five quarters.RELATED:Looking For Winners?

Meanwhile, housing demand remains strong.Companies have been staffing up in recent months, even as economic growth remains sluggish, creating a puzzle for investors and Federal Reserve policymakers. It's unclear how long that disconnect can continue.

168,PHM,"After losing ground on Monday, shares of No. 1 homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) roared back to life Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for its September-ending fourth quarter as the number of finished homes climbed 23% and new orders rose 19%, led by strong growth in the Southeast.Shares closed up 8.3% in the stock market today. They had dipped more than 2% Monday along with a broad falloff in homebuilder stocks as investors weighed the increased possibility of a Fed rate hike in December. Other homebuilders also sprung back on Tuesday.The Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton earned 64 cents a share in the quarter, two cents above views and up from last year's 45 cents. Homebuilding revenue of $3.05 billion was 28% higher than a year earlier.Smaller homebuilder Beazer Homes (BZH), which also reported results for its September-ending quarter early Tuesday, didn't fare as well early in the trading day after it reported mixed results, including a 12% gain in home closings vs. a year earlier but a slight drop in orders and homebuilding gross margin. But it ended the day up 5.6%.Of Beazer's $354.5 million in net income from continuing operations, nearly $324 million came from a tax benefit. The company said that it expects ""significant"" growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2016 and beyond, however.While D.R. Horton's net sales orders — a future-looking barometer — increased 19% to 8,477 homes, the value of those homes rose 22% to $2.5 billion. The biggest gains were in the Southeast, where the number of communities had grown sharply over the last couple of years.Orders in the Southeast jumped 40% to 2,868 homes. Orders in the South Central region, which includes the firm's home state of Texas, rose nearly 8% to 2,367 homes, but their value increased 19%.Horton's average selling prices in the quarter were up only 3.4% as sales of lower-priced, entry-level Express Homes increased. With an average price of $191,000, they accounted for more than 20% of homes sold and 14% of home-sales revenue, the majority of sales coming from Texas, Florida and the Carolinas, said a company spokeswoman.In a conference call, executives said that they expect Express Homes and the firm's high-end Emerald Homes division to continue expanding, with Express Homes seen rising to around 20% of home-sales revenue by the end of fiscal 2016 and Emerald Homes in the high single digits.At the end of September, Horton had a sales order backlog of 10,662 homes, up 10% in value from a year earlier and a ""well-stocked supply of land and lots,"" Chief Executive David Auld said in a morning conference call. That, he added, gives it a ""strong competitive advantage.""Horton raised its quarterly dividend 28% to 8 cents a share, payable on Dec. 14.Lennar (LEN), the second largest homebuilder, was up 3.35% at the close Tuesday. PulteGroup (PHM) gained 3.6%. Toll Bros. (TOL) advanced 2%. It fell 1.2% Monday even though it reported a fairly decent October-ending quarter that day.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

170,PHM,"Housing surprised to the upside for a change — and in a big way. April starts surged more than 20% to the highest since November 2007, and permits leapt 10% to the fastest since 2008. Both single-family and multifamily starts jumped by double-digits in the month, but single-family starts are up 15% vs. a year ago.Starts in the weather-battered Northeast offered some proof of the temporary factors that have been wreaking havoc with economic data in past months. They tumbled 57% from January to February, then rebounded 115% in March and 86% in April.Homebuilders have had a mixed spring. D.R. Horton (DHI) said orders jumped by nearly a third in Q1, but that margins could be pressured as entry-level homes make up a greater share of the total. Meritage (MTH) is forecasting revenue that's higher by as much as 25-20% in 2015, but PulteGroup (PHM) saw profit drop 26% in Q1. Builder confidence took a step back in April, the National Association of Home Builders said Monday, but sentiment remains relatively high, with builders particularly bullish about the next 6 months.Lennar (LEN), PulteGroup, KB Home (KBH), Meritage and D.R. Horton (DHI) rallied in the stock market today, but came off earlier highs as the market reversed.

NVR, for example, has a majority of its communities in the hard-hit mid-Atlantic and Rust Belt, noted analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee in a preview report on Friday.Of the five reporting, McCanless has buy ratings on only two — PulteGroup and Meritage. (He didn't report on M/I.) He expects Pulte's year-over-year orders in the quarter to be up 5%, above expectations for a little over 2%, and the average selling price to also come in above views, up 6.3% to $336,936.Meritage previously reported that January orders jumped 48% vs. a year earlier, which McCanless attributed to the addition of Legendary Homes in August and improving sales in the Southeast. He sees unit orders growing 16% for the full quarter, below views.McCanless noted that Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton is taking a ""cautious approach"" in Texas oil markets of Houston and Midland, which accounted for 6% of the builder's fiscal 2014 housing revenue.In D.R. Horton's December-ending first quarter, orders were higher than expected and its speculative home count grew by more than a third, McCanless noted.D.R. Horton is the highest rated stock in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. Next highest is Lennar (LEN), which reported its February-ending first quarter last month. Lennar's earnings and revenue in the quarter topped views but gross margin fell, as expected, on higher costs.Homebuilder stocks fell in unison late last week after government data showed that March housing starts were up just 2% to an annualized rate of 926,000, missing views for 1.04 million. Starts were 2.5% lower than a year earlier.RELATED:Will Builders See Spring Home Sales Heat Up?

303,PHM,"In another sign that the housing recovery is moving on track, the share of underwater homeowners sank to a low point at the end of the fourth quarter, according to a report released Thursday by housing data and analytics provider RealtyTrac.

"
305,PHM,"The number and share of seriously underwater homeowners at the end of 2014 were both at their lowest levels since RealtyTrac began tracking trends in home equity, in the first quarter of 2012, and they are down from a peak of 12.8 million seriously underwater homeowners — 29% of all owners with a mortgage — in the second quarter of 2012.

"
307,PHM,"""Median home prices nationwide bottomed out in March 2012 and since then have increased 35%, lifting 5.8 million homeowners out of seriously underwater territory,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, in a statement.
"
308,PHM,"""While the remaining seriously underwater properties continue to be a millstone around the neck of some local markets,"" he added, ""the growing number of equity-rich homeowners should help counteract the downward pull of negative equity in many markets, empowering those housing markets — and by extension their local economies — to 'walk on water' in 2015.""
"
309,PHM,"Equity-rich properties, those with at least 50% positive equity, increased to 11.25 million at the end of 2014, representing 20% of all properties with a mortgage — up from 9.10 million equity-rich properties at the end of 2013.
"
310,PHM,"As the number of underwater properties decreases and the number of equity-rich properties rises, more owners will have the ability to meet underwriting standards and finance the purchase of new homes. With a nice equity cushion in their dwellings, combined with a rising home value, owners may be more receptive to sell and move up to bigger homes.
"
311,PHM,"So a lesser number of underwater homeowners and a greater number of equity-rich homeowners could benefit homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), Toll Bros. (TOL) and PulteGroup (PHM).
"
312,PHM,"""With price escalation returning home values to near peak levels, homeowners who have positive equity have options before they face foreclosure,"" said Chris Pollinger, senior vice president of sales at First Team Real Estate, in the RealtyTrac report.

"
327,PHM,"Data disclosed last week indicated the housing recovery is on track. That may lift homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), which leads off a busy week in which five homebuilders are slated to report quarterly performance.Homebuilders are trying to rebound after earnings and revenue growth weakened in the back half of 2014 amid market uncertainty.D.R. Horton, which bills itself as ""America's Builder"" and is the largest in the group by annual revenue, will release first-quarter financial results Monday before the market opens.The consensus of analysts is for a 2-cent drop in earnings per share to 34 cents. Investors hope Horton can reverse that to a beat after missing analysts' EPS estimates the prior two quarters.Revenue is projected to rise 27.2% to $2.075 billion.D.R. Horton stock is bouncing back from a failed breakout with a 26.04 buy point. It's trading below its 50-day but finding support at its 200-day line. Horton closed down 2.5% Friday to 23.10.PulteGroup (PHM) is set to announce Q4 earnings Thursday before the market opens.Wall Street expects the builder of single-family homes, condos, townhouses and duplexes to report a 17-cent drop in EPS to 40 cents. Investors will be looking for a repeat of the prior quarter's results when Pulte reported better than expected EPS.Revenue is projected to grow 6.5% to $1.76 billion.Pulte shares moved sideways for most of 2014, trading in a narrow range. Like Horton, it tried to break out early this year but retreated and was trading back in the range Friday. It closed Friday off 1% to 20.69.Smaller peers MDC Holdings (MDC), Ryland (RYL) and Beazer Homes (BZH) will also report results, opening a window onto housing prospects this year.MDC is scheduled to release Q4 earnings Wednesday. Ryland will announce Q4 Thursday, and Beazer is on tap to release fiscal Q1 earnings Friday.Bullish signs are popping up for homebuilders. The Census Bureau said last week that December housing starts beat estimates, rising 4.4% to an annualized 1.098 million units and lifting 2014 to the strongest overall year since 2007.Single-family home permits rose 4.5% in December to an annual rate of 667,000, the strongest monthly gain of 2014.In another sign the housing recovery is on track, the share of homeowners whose loans are underwater fell to the lowest point since the number peaked in the second quarter 2012, according to housing market tracker RealtyTrac.However, Lennar (LEN), which builds single-family homes in 17 states, on Jan. 15 reported higher earnings per share, but revenue growth fell short of estimates. And Lennar said it expects lower profit margins this year amid rising costs.KB Home (KBH) also reported a revenue gain on Jan. 13, but EPS fell 9.7% and was half what Wall Street expected.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

""There is still plenty of momentum to go forward.""But new questions arose about whether millennials will buy homes at the same rate as earlier generations did. Piegza said they prefer to rent and may stay out of the home-buying market in the near term.And a new Pew Research Center study out Tuesday found that Americans 18 to 34 years old in 2014 were more likely to be live with their parents than in their own household with a spouse or partner. Pew said that is the first time that's happened in the modern era.But Robert Toll remained upbeat about the key demographic group, saying on a conference call that “as millennials mature, studies indicate their appetite for housing is consistent with past generations.”Meanwhile, paint and coatings company Valspar (VAL), which is being bought by Sherwin-Williams (SHW) for $11.3 billion, also said Tuesday that adjusted fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9.9% to $1.22 a share, 4 cents below forecasts. Revenue slid 2.1% to $1.056 billion, lighter than the expected $1.122 billion.

397,PHM,"Attracting first-time homebuyers might seem like courting a herd of underfed cats.Squeezed by tight credit, student debt and low wages, they're still the missing link to a robust housing recovery.But not for LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH), a small homebuilder based near Houston. It sends 12,000 pieces of direct mail ""every single week"" to renters in complexes within 25 miles of one of its active communities, says CEO Eric Lipar.With homes selling for under $200,000 — the average in the past quarter was $166,000 — first-time buyers are the company's prime customers.They've been flocking to its communities, some 38 at last count, including markets in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Colorado.About 95% of LGI buyers are renters. Their interest ""is triggered by getting a rental-notice increase,"" Lipar told IBD. ""Rising rents work to our advantage for sure.""LGI, which went public a year ago, closed sale on 2,110 homes through the end of November compared with 1,617 for all of 2013.""When a lot of builders were getting out of entry-level, we stuck with it, and we've always been profitable,"" Lipar said. ""Our plan is to stick with first-time buyers.""The company may see busier days, as could other builders aiming at first-timers, such as large-cap builder D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), with its low-priced Express Homes.At a little over 30% of the overall homebuying market, the share of first-time buyers in 2014 hit its lowest point in nearly 30 years, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).Homes Easier To Afford?Affordability is still an issue, but early signs are emerging of a better climate for first-time buyers, including an improving job market.For the three months ended in November, employment in America grew 2% year over year, the strongest rate since the first quarter of 2006. And the key first-time-buyer cohort — the missing 25- to 29-year-olds — showed a 3% gain.Though new jobs ""are not as high-paying as in the past, it's still acceleration,"" said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist with property researcher CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX). ""So it should foreshadow an increase in demand for first-time buyers.""A second reason may also help: Institutional investors are leaving the market. That means ""less competition for starter homes,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR.Investors paying all cash for starter homes had bid up prices, shutting out many first-time buyers. But price gains are decelerating.The latest S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show a slight drop in the 10- and 20-city composites in October vs. September. They still were up 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively, from a year earlier.""I call it a more organic market, less influenced by distressed sales and artificial support from quantitative easing"" by the Feds, Khater said. He added that ""2015 will really be the first year (in many) that both volumes and price movements will reflect fundamentals — meaning supply, demand and income.""That shift is ""beginning to be reflected in home prices,"" he said.Markets On The MoveKhater notes that many markets with the biggest price gains in 2014 had the strongest underlying economies, based especially on technology and energy industries.Pricey San Francisco, a leading tech center, showed the biggest monthly gain of all 20 cities in Case-Shiller's latest survey, at nearly 1% in October over September.Khater points out that lower-priced homes are seeing faster growth than higher-end homes in the top 25 U.S. housing markets, reflecting tight supply and a lack of new construction for single-family starter homes.Some markets, such as those in the Carolinas and Texas, are seeing robust construction and sales trends, he says.Falling oil prices may make energy-capital Houston — one of the country's hottest home markets recently — and other Texas markets ""vulnerable"" to a slowdown in new oil-related jobs in 2015, says the NAR's Yun.Still, the Lone Star State is diversified, ""so it may be able to withstand the potential decline because other sectors of the economy continue to show strength,"" he said. Also, Texas has more affordable homes relative to many other housing markets around the nation.Jobs And Sun Belt MigrationYun sees housing demand growing in Rocky Mountain states such as Colorado and Utah, thanks to strong job growth.Meanwhile, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are benefiting from corporate relocations as well as retirees moving in.""I see opportunities on two ends,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.""The entry-level buyer will come back, though more slowly than most people think,"" he said. ""And the older buyer — the retiree — is already back and buying homes, a lot of them paying all cash.""Today's generation of first-time buyers are older than their predecessors because they have delayed marriage and having children, Burns says.""The ultimate impetus (for buying a first home) is when you need to put a child into a school. We're seeing more of those buyers,"" he said.Still waiting to make their move are many buyers who bought entry-level homes in the early 2000s and saw their homes plummet in value during the housing downturn. Now largely in their early 40s, they don't have enough equity to move, Burns says.He expects that older baby boomers will continue to support the housing market in 2015 and beyond as they sell their homes at a profit and then use the cash to buy other homes.""We're seeing active-adult communities pop up all over the country,"" Burns said. ""They're doing great.""Especially active on that front is homebuilder PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), with its Del Webb Communities.In a report this week, analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee said he prefers builders ""who concentrate on older, move-up buyers bringing equity from their previous home to the closing table.""His top picks among that group are PulteGroup, WCI Communities (NYSE:WCIC) and Ryland Group (NYSE:RYL).New low-down-payment programs from Fannie Mae (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCBB:FMCC) may spur healthy order growth for eligible first-time buyers in 2015, he noted, ""if originators take the bait.""He expects the lack of mortgage availability for first-time and subprime buyers to continue into 2015 ""because we do not believe banks are being compensated for the tail risk on mortgages.""Still, slower price appreciation opens up opportunities for potential new homebuyers after months and years of robust price gains ""acted to squeeze out new buyers,"" noted Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Sterne Agee, in a report this week.""Slower price gains and still historically low interest rates (around 4%) may work to encourage new demand in 2015,"" she wrote.Housing watchers don't expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates much, if at all, in the near term, perhaps not until mid-2015 at the earliest.Meanwhile, CEO Lipar of LGI Homes is counting on more first-time buyers to come his way as they ""save more and work on their credit scores.""""Demand will always be there from people who rent,"" he said.

448,PHM,"The homebuilding comeback anticipated this year didn't happen.High expectations were built around views that demand would finally spike after years of post-recessionary lethargy among traditional buyers.""2014 was a big disappointment,"" said Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy, a unit of Hanley Wood that studies the homebuilding sector.""In the beginning of the year everyone thought single-family housing starts would be up 20%, and it turns out they will be up 4% (by Metrostudy's estimate).""But builders and other housing watchers are more confident about 2015, as building permits have recently increased.Even so, many housing watchers are not expecting a huge jump in new-home construction. ""It is going to be very modest,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee. ""Arguably, it is what we want to see. It ensures a more sustainable recovery. I'd be concerned if we had seen another bubble run-up.""Going Where The Buyers AreBuilders have learned to be patient and pace themselves. That means they are allocating resources to areas with the best demand, such as certain markets in Texas, California, Florida and Georgia — Forsyth County north of Atlanta, for example.Single-family housing starts in some markets were up as much as 45.8% over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, says Metrostudy. That high mark was in Naples/Fort Myers in Southwest Florida.""It's a market that was badly beaten up during the downturn, but it's also a market with strong fundamentals,"" Hunter said.Besides being a retirement and second-home magnet for affluent buyers, the area has a university, growing middle class and job growth, he says.""Wealthy people need estate planning, lawyers, accountants, bankers and medical care. There's a very large medical industry there,"" Hunter said.Top homebuilders in the Naples/Fort Myers market are PulteGroup's (PHM) active-adult division Del Webb, Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), according to a survey by drive-by teams from Metrostudy.Existing-home prices in the region's Lee County are back to early 2004 levels and new homes are mostly in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, Hunter says.Home construction in Southern California is up 28.4% in the same recent 12-month period, Metrostudy says, with the greatest gains in another bruised area, the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles.""All the excess supply is gone,"" Hunter said of the Inland Empire's Riverside-San Bernardino area near the I-15 corridor flanking L.A. ""That area turned around from being massively overbuilt and with falling prices to coming back strong and prices moving up.""The top two builders in that market are KB Home (KBH) and Lennar, according to Metrostudy.Lennar is also active in other parts of California and in Texas, including Houston, which is the No. 1 market for housing starts.Still, Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar, believes the housing market is far from recovered. In remarks after the firm's latest quarterly results were released, he compared the ""extremely low volume of dwellings"" built over the past seven years to a housing depression.""Before this downturn, anything below 1 million housing starts in a year was considered almost a housing depression,"" he said. ""This recovery is just now getting us back to that level of starts.""The recovery is still only at the ""halfway"" mark back to normal, says David Crowe, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders. He was referring largely to single-family homes, which he said comprises the bulk of the home-building industry.""This is a much slower recovery (than) from any of the recessions since the Great Depression,"" Crowe said.However, multifamily construction, mostly rental apartments, is back to normal as builders try to satisfy demand from millennials and others who can't afford or don't want to buy a home just yet.""A normal market would be at least 1.5 million housing starts (annually),"" said Piegza. ""We were down to 500,000 (in 2009) and it took five years to make progress up to 1 million. Given that trajectory, it would be five-plus years to get to 1.5 million, when we can say it's a healthy market.""Overall housing starts in October were pacing at an annualized rate of a little over 1 million units, 2.8% below the revised September estimate but 7.8% above October 2013, the Census Bureau said last week.Crowe of the builders' trade group thinks a back-to-normal builders' market will occur sooner, in 2017. There would have to be a lot of fast catching-up.Crowe thinks single-family home starts will increase next year to around 800,000, from an expected 640,000 this year. If that comes to fruition, it would be the best gain since the recession ended.New-Home Sales Rise SlowlyActual sales of new single-family homes tracked at an annualized pace of 458,000 in October, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. That is just 0.7% above September's revised rate and 1.8% above the 450,000 seen in October 2013.""The low was about 350,000, so we haven't made much progress in terms of home sales,"" Piegza said.Like other housing watchers, she blames the usual suspects: strict lending, slow wage growth and low numbers of first-time homebuyers, due in part to millennials being dragged down by student debt and low wages.""It comes back to the ability to finance, access to credit and being able to put 20% down,"" she said. ""Credit is looser, but it is still tight.""Toll Bros. (TOL), which targets the luxury market, is not as impacted by credit challenges as builders with lots of entry-level products. Its buyers typically put 30% down, and 20% pay all cash, Hunter says, ""so they are somewhat insulated from these mortgage issues these days.""October's median price of a new house rose to $305,000 in October from $264,300 a year earlier, the Census Bureau said. That gain ""reinforces our view that move-up and luxury buyers remain the most eligible buyer in the U.S. market,"" noted analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee.As for existing homes, pending sales fell modestly in October, according to the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index, which is based on contract signings. The index fell 1.1% to 104.1 from 105.3 in September. Anything above 100 is viewed as an average level of contract activity.Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, noted less competition from investors paying all cash.The median price for an existing home of any type in October rose 5.5% from a year earlier to $208,300. Last year through October the average month's year-over-year gain was 11.5%, the NAR says.Price gains, moderating though they are, give previously stuck homeowners with little or no equity ""the ability to sell,"" Yun noted. And when an existing home sells, oftentimes the seller will move into a newly built home.

The number of homes for sale was the highest since October 2009, while homes underway hit the highest since the end of 2008.That suggests homebuilders are growing a little less cautious about ramping up construction.

474,PHM,"The younger crowd may be skittish about moving into the housing market due to sparse financial resources and lack of credit.But it's a different story for Americans age 55 and over. Those who can are jumping into homebuying — selling their existing houses to move into new ones aimed at their age group. Many are at or near retirement, while others are seeking a change in lifestyle — and at this age they can have financial flexibility.Some have reaped hefty gains from the stock market, adding to a nest egg saved over the years. Rising home values in the housing recovery have also given more of them the ability to finally sell, at an appreciated price or at least one that can cover the mortgage.Top homebuilders such as PulteGroup (PHM), Lennar (LEN) and Toll Bros. (TOL) report brisk sales for their active-adult homes and homes that appeal to the 55-plus crowd.Take PulteGroup, which builds the Del Webb brand of active adult communities for adults 55 and over.""Consistent with the overall housing market, we have seen sustained improvement in demand for our active adult homes for the past two-plus years,"" PulteGroup spokesman James Zeumer told IBD via email.Signing Up SalesThe company's active-adult sales lifted from roughly 4,100 homes in 2011 to about 5,300 in 2013. Zeumer says the recovery in active-adult home demand continued into 2014. Sign-ups in the first quarter were up 7% and in the second quarter they rose 11% over a year earlier.One gauge of demand in the single-family 55-plus housing market is the National Association of Home Builders 55+ Housing Market Index. In the second quarter the index increased three points from a year earlier to a level of 56. That's the highest second-quarter reading since the inception of the index in 2008 and the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year improvements.The prognosis for homebuying across all age groups looks improved this summer with Thursday's release of July data on contracts signed to buy existing homes, and that could further bolster the 55-plus group's prospects to sell their old homes.The pending home sales index rose 3.3% from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, though down 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported. It's at the highest level since last August and at 105.9 is above the level of 100 considered an average activity level.""One of the factors contributing to the positive signs in the 55+ housing market is the slow but steady increase in existing-home sales in the last three months,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a press release. ""The 55+ market is strongly driven by consumers being able to sell their existing homes at a favorable price in order to buy or rent in a 55+ community.""Domino Effect AppliesAdds NAHB Director of Economic Services Stephen Melman: ""The best thing that could happen for new construction is that the existing-home market improves. Every prospective buyer, like the age 55-plus buyer, has to sell their existing home before they buy a new one. The real key (to the index rise) was the existing-home market.""Total existing-home sales lifted 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million in July, according to the NAR. Sales notched their highest pace of 2014 and have risen four straight months. But they remain 4.3% below the 5.38 million-unit level last July, the peak of 2013. ""Existing-home sales are continuing to move up,"" said Melman. ""But the one caveat is the first-time homebuyer's share (of those sales) was less than 29%. Typically that would be 40%. So existing-home sales are increasing, but the first-time buyer isn't in there full tilt. So it may be the 55-plus (group) buying homes that meet their demand.""Sales of new single-family homes fell 2.4% monthly in July, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales, at 412,000, marked the lowest level since March, although it was a 12.3% rise from last July.Demand for new homes by the 55-plus age group is on the rise.Toll Bros. Active Living is the luxury homebuilders' active-adult division, with single-family homes, condos and town houses. As of April 2014, it accounted for 8% of the company's revenue, says Toll Bros. Group President Chris Gaffney. He says all of Toll Bros.' homebuyers, including the 55 and over active adult group, have been motivated to buy in the past year or so.""During this recent downturn, so many people were out of the buying market,"" Gaffney told IBD. ""Now, they've seen their portfolios grow again, and they're extremely interested in making a move because interest rates are still fabulous.""Gaffney says there's ""plenty of pent-up demand"" on part of the active adult buyers following a pullback during the recession, and the ""affordability index is quite high when you look at history.""These older buyers, he adds, have gotten ""tired of putting their lives"" on hold in the wake of the recession. "" Generally these folks are extremely savvy and successful, they have tremendous FICO (credit) scores, they've built up their portfolios over the years and understand exactly what they want with their lifestyle and what they're looking to do as they move forward in life. .""Melman said by email: ""The stronger 55+ market could be put in context of the overall strength of the trade-up market/higher-income buyers, except this group is focused not on larger homes but new homes better designed for their needs. As existing sales slowly increase, more people who put plans on hold can now sell their existing home to finance what they really want for the next ten or twenty years: quality design, low maintenance, accommodations for family.""Homes Built To FitMajor homebuilders are luring this group with a raft of amenities.Besides its active adult communities, Lennar offers an option for multigenerational families living under one roof. The ""Next Gen"" home within a home features a suite with a separate private entrance, bedroom, bathroom, laundry, eat-in kitchenette and living room.Jeff Roos, Western regional president for Lennar, says many buyers want to let their children live in the suite. Since it started making these homes available at the end of 2011, Lennar has sold over 2,000. It has 120 Next Gen communities and more than 50 floor-plan options.""The Next Gen is growing every day as we expand across the country,"" Roos told IBD. ""This is the first time a homebuilder came out with a great solution for a multigenerational home. It's the first time (the different generations) can live together, but independently. We're seeing a big movement toward it. Our reception to the product has far exceeded our expectations.""Zeumer calls Del Webb homes ""perfect for empty-nesters who may be looking to downsize, but not necessarily downgrade the features and finishings of their next home.""Options can include big garages, flex spaces, wet bars, hearth rooms, raised dishwashers and sunrooms.

475,PHM,"Even with an adjustment for the Labor Day holiday, it was a tough week for mortgage applications. The Mortgage Bankers Association overall activity index declined 7.2% to the lowest level of activity in 14 years.Applications to purchase a home were down 2.6%, the lowest since late February. Refinancing activity slid 10.7% to the lowest level since 2008. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose 2 basis points to 4.27%, but is still near the lowest levels in more than a year.

489,PHM,"Investors dumped stocks in late-afternoon trading Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, as widely expected. The Dow industrials were holding up the best among the key benchmarks, losing less than 0.1% at around 2:45 p.m. ET, after marking a new all-time high of 21,354 earlier in the day.But the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was off 0.3%, disguising decent gains from grain, non-alcoholic beverage, homebuilding, automaker, packaged food, meat and tobacco stocks.Weak U.S. economic data on retail sales and consumer prices sent long U.S. government bonds soaring, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note falling to as low as 2.10%. That low takes the yield on the 10-year bond back to levels right after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.While the fed funds rate is like to go up a quarter point to a target range of 1%-1.25%, banking stocks are falling amid poor data on U.S. retail sales (down 0.3% in May, vs. the Econoday consensus view for a 0.1% rise). However, damage is relatively limited among the top financial plays so far.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dropped as much as 1.5% before shaving losses to around 0.7% at 86.66, but volume at 2:30 p.m. ET was running well below usual levels.Among the groups leading the upside, IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group is a market leader, ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.The group has at least eight companies boasting a Composite Rating of 95 or higher, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. They include NVR (NVR), Taylor Morrison (TMHC), MDC Holdings (MDC), Pulte Group (PHM), MI Homes (MHO) and Toll Bros. (TOL).NVR added 0.4% to 2,443 in dull volume. The luxury homebuilder in the East Coast ran past a 1,845.47 saucer-type base entry after reporting an 18% rise in fourth-quarter earnings per share on Jan. 25. For now, shares are extended. Taylor Morrison, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., is extended from a first-stage big cup with handle at 18.46. Shares are up more than 3% for the week at 24.49.Industry peer D.R. Horton (DHI) is not in this elite group, yet its 92 Composite Rating is still respectable. The Fort Worth, Texas, maker of single-family homes rose 2% to 34.63, poking briefly above a 34.64 entry in a long cup with handle.Horton has done a solid job of posting steady and solid gains on both the top and bottom lines.Earnings have nearly quadrupled over the past four years, from 67 cents a share in fiscal 2012 (ended in September that year) to $2.36 a share in FY 2016. Sales have jumped from $4.35 billion to $12.16 billion over the same time frame.However, the Street is expecting slower growth in the future, and that may have something to do with the stock's recent failed attempts to make much of a gain after a solid breakout. The stock, as seen in a daily chart, tried to clear a 34.15 handle buy point on April 17-18, but notice how volume was less than stellar. The stock sold off hard the next several sessions, but Horton has done a good job of not falling too far below its critical 50-day moving average.IBD's TAKE: Home Depot is not the only consumer spending stock that is excelling this year. Go to IBD Big Cap 20 to find at least six names that are benefiting from strong demand in the medical, leisure and building-related industries.Pulte bucked the decline with a 0.6% rise to 24.28 and volume was heavy. The stock briefly advanced past a 24.53 buy point in a new seven-week flat base. The 12% decline within the base falls within normal range for a flat base, one of the most bullish patterns that great stocks form en route to excellent breakouts and fantastic price gains.Despite some questionable action by the builders on Wednesday, the prospect of a continued slow rise in the cost of money should be a tail wind for these builders and related stocks, since low interest rates encourage home buying. Home Depot (HD) gained more than 1% to 156.42 in fast turnover, triggering a new follow-on entry point as it finds nice buying support at the 50-day moving average. It's the second test of the 50-day line since the DIY building products retailer cleared a 137.42 cup-with-handle buy point in January.The Dow 30 component and mega-cap retailer has a decent but not great Composite Rating of 82 on a scale of 1 to 99. But that masks reasonable EPS growth targets of 12% and 13% in the next two full fiscal years.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) surrendered minor early gains and fell nearly 1% to 145.21, but the tech leader is still trading just 2% below its rising 50-day moving average. As noted in prior Stock Market Today columns earlier this week, the iPhone maker is in the midst of a general turnaround in both earnings and revenue growth. The stock had broken out of a proper cup-with-handle base on Jan. 6-9, moving smoothly past a 118.12 entry, 10 cents above the handle's high. Apple has since rallied more than 30%.Five Below (FIVE) sank as much as 6% to a session low of 48, undercutting its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The stock is trying to rebound off that low but is still down 5%. Volume is running more than double normal levels. A future rebound and close near or above the 50-day line, currently around 49.59, would mark a bullish shakeout.RELATED:In Stock Market Today: Is Apple Flashing A New Buy Signal?Top Growth Stocks Today: Check The Latest IBD 50Strong Large-Cap Names: What's In The Current IBD Big Cap 20?

491,PHM,"Homebuilder stocks sold off Tuesday after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber imports, a move that could raise housing prices signficantly. Meanwhile, Pulte Group (PHM) reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, the second builder to deliver disappointing results in less than a week.The U.S. government slapped a retroactive penalty on Canadian softwood late Monday. The tariff could raise the cost of a home by $1,236, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Just the prospect of a tariff had helped push up lumber prices sharply after the a prior U.S.-Canada deal expired at the end of last year.Before Tuesday's market open, Pulte Group earned 31 cents a share excluding various items, up 29% vs. a year earlier. Analysts had expected EPS of 29 cents. Revenue climbed 14% to $1.629 billion, below Wall Street targets of $1.7538 billion.Net orders rose 8% by units and 16% by dollar value.Pulte shares slid 3.8% to 22.20 in the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average. The stock is technically above a 22.08 buy point after falling as low as 21.41, but it's the fourth straight loss in above-average volume. Pulte cleared that entry in late February, as builders rallied on tight housing supply and labor markets, with mortgage rates pulling back from postelection peaks.Pulte's recent retreat began when D.R. Horton (DHI) reported quarterly results on April 20. D.R. Horton's earnings were strong, but there were some concerns about guidance and order cancellations. D.R. Horton initially retook a buy point that day but soon reversed lower, dragging down Pulte and other builders. D.R. Horton sank 1.2%, undercutting its 50-day line but closing near session highs.Lennar (LEN) tumbled 1.7%, testing its 50-day moving average. The stock has been forming a flat base after breaking out in late February from a prior consolidation.Meanwhile, investors got  a pair of relatively upbeat economic reports on housing Tuesday.The S&P/Case-Schiller home price index rose 0.7% in February vs. January, seasonally adjusted, below views for a 0.8% gain. But the 5.9% yearly rise just topped views.New-home sales jumped 5.8% in March to an annual rate of 621,000, the highest since July, the Commerce Department said. That was much better than views for a slight dip to an annualized 584,000.Separately, the Consumer Confidence Index fell to 120.3 in April from a downwardly revised 124.9 in March. Economists had expected 123.1. The consumer gauge remains high, but off postelection peaks.RELATED:D.R. Horton Reverses From Buy Point Despite Strong Earnings, Guidance

498,PHM,"Toll Bros. (TOL) on Tuesday reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings early Tuesday, citing strong demand in ""affordable"" luxury homes. But shares of Toll Bros. and several other builders reversed to close lower, in part due to plunging new-home sales data.April U.S. new-home sales fell 11.4% to annual rate of 569,000 units, the Commerce Department reported at 10 a.m. ET, far less than the 602,000 expected. March sales were revised up substantially to a 10-year highs. Commerce figures last week showed a dip in housing starts and building permits for the month.Toll Bros.' results come as many homebuilder stocks remain in bases or buy zones, and as Wall Street looks for more insights into the state of the housing market.Estimates: Earnings per share of 63 cents, a 23.5% jump, on sales up 13.6% to $1.27 billion.Results: EPS up 43% to 72 cents with revenue up 22.2% to $1.36 billion.Toll delivered 1,638 units, up 22% in dollars and 26% in units, compared to FY 2016's second quarter. The average price of homes delivered was $832,400, compared to $855,500 one year ago as Toll makes more homes that are slightly less expensive.Net signed contracts rose to $2.02 billion and 2,511 units, up 23% in dollars and 26% in units.Outlook: Toll narrowed its fiscal-year delivery guidance to 6,950 and 7,450 homes vs. its old range of 6,700 to 7,500 units. The new midpoint is 7,200 homes, up from 7,100.""We believe we are benefiting from the appeal and national recognition of the Toll Brothers brand and a lack of large scale competition in the affordable end of the luxury new home market,"" said CEO Douglas Yearley in a statement.Stock: Shares hit 39.37 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today, but closed down 0.7% at 37.78. The stock is extended after breaking out of a flat base in February.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) hit 53.32 soon after the open, briefly topping a 53.10 entry of a double-bottom base, but closed down 1.6% to 51.63. D.R. Horton (DHI) fell 1.6% to 33.37 after initially climbing to 34.39, near a 34.64 buy point from a saucer-with-handle base. Beazer Homes (BZH) is working on a cup base with a 15.90 buy point, but reversed from a 2% gain to a 2.5% slide at 14.28. Pulte Group (PHM) sank 1.55% to 22.93.Toll's earnings arrive as more millennials start to consider buying homes in a higher-priced housing market. The real estate company Redfin, in a December forecast, predicted that the housing market would keep growing this year, ""but at a slower pace due to affordability pressures.""""Sales would be stronger if there were more starter homes on the market to meet demand from millennial homebuyers,"" Redfin said. ""The lack of starter homes will keep sales growth weak next year.""But rising prices have helped home-improvement retailers like Home Depot (HD) and rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Lowe's dipped to 84.05 on Monday, just below an 84.10 buy point. Lowe's edged up to 84.19 early but reversed for modest losses.Management for Home Depot, whose first-quarter results last week beat analyst forecasts, said on its earnings call that ""housing continues to be a growing asset class, and our sales thus far in May have been very good.""

502,PHM,"XStrong gains continued in the stock market for a second consecutive day. The Dow Jones industrial average paved the way with a 1.1% gain at lunchtime in New York on Tuesday, driven by a number of bullish earnings releases among its components. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 followed up with milder 0.6% rises as the tech composite claimed the 6000 mark. Among the Dow industrials, heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) surged more than 6.6% out of a flat base after reporting Q1 earnings that handily surpassed the Street's estimates. This morning's gap-up put shares well above the flat base's 99.56 buy point, but shares remain within buy range.Other Dow earnings reporters McDonald's (MCD) and DuPont (DD) provided more fuel to the Dow's fire early Tuesday. Both beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates.

But homebuilding companies continue to face labor shortages as the housing bust last decade sent skilled workers to other fields.In March, housing starts declined 6.8% to a annualized rate of 1.22 million units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, as severe weather in the Midwest weighed on activity and followed an unseasonably warm February that inflated activity.

Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12.

Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated.

All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings.

Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R.

Pulte's 50-day average turnover is 5 million shares.Pulte's strong move follows the nice rally in 2017 by peer NVR Inc. (NVR), up 2% to 1,978.35. The stock on Jan. 25 blasted past a 1,845.47 cup entry and has so far risen more than 7%.In tech land, memory chip firm Micron Technology (MU), benefiting from positive analyst comments at Goldman Sachs, surged more than 5% to 24.54. Volume is running more than 30% above typical levels. Micron is acting like a true market leader, bouncing sharply off a test of the 50-day moving average last week. The stock is now up 33% past a recent flat-base breakout past 18.43.That base is part of a very long bottoming base pattern going back to Micron's 2014 peak of 36.59.Apple, rising 2% to 139.98, is getting close to nailing a 20% gain from a Jan. 6 breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12. The largest stock on the U.S. financial markets has also expanded its gain from a 110.33 bottoming base breakout to more than 26%, so investors may decide to take at least partial gains.Confidence is building in Apple's ability to maintain fast growth in its services businesses and confidence that the upcoming iPhone 8 model will be a big hit. Also, the stock is getting extra attention from news of Warren Buffett's big bet on the company.Not all techs were thriving. Data networking technology expert Inphi (IPHI) slumped for a sixth straight session, slipping more than 2% to 45.76 and piercing through its 50-day moving average in fast turnover. The Santa Clara, Calif., small cap has a tendency to shake investors out who buy at traditional base breakouts, such as its early October breakout past a 44.64 flat-base buy point. Yet the stock has also shown resilience after spending some time below the 50-day line.Plus, Inphi's uptrend since breaking out of a three-month double bottom at 33.69 in the summer of last year remains intact.Amid the continued strong U.S. dollar, gold shares have struggled as a group, and the gold and silver mining industry group has been laggard for months, ranking in the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 group rankings in terms of six-month relative performance.Goldcorp (GG) gapped down at the open and fell 1.3% to 15.74, marking what could be its eighth straight decline. Watch to see if the stock can find support near its climbing 50-day moving average. Newmont Mining (NEM) reversed from intraday lows to gain 1% to 34.63, but shares took out the 50-day line on Monday.RELATED:Stock Market Today: When Did Apple Initially Break Out?How To Invest: The Case For A Trump-Era Secular Bull RunInside The IBD 50: Will 2017 Be A Grand Year For Earnings?

Meanwhile, January existing-home sales soared to a 10-year high in January despite tight supply and higher interest rates.The builder of homes worth up to $2 million earned 42 cents a share, up 5% vs. a year earlier. Analysts expected a 10% EPS drop to 36 cents. Sales dipped less than 1% to $920.73 million, better than views for $902.49 million.Toll shares soared 6.1% to 33.93 on the stock market today, gapping above a 33.58 buy point and hitting a 52-week high. On Tuesday, Toll initiated a quarterly dividend of 8 cents a share. The stock rose 1.6% to 31.99 on Tuesday, rising above its 50-day moving average.Pulte Group (PHM), KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) also are consolidating close to buy points. Pulte rose 0.5% and Lennar 0.6%, but KB Home reversed to close down about 1%.A tight supply of existing homes is helping to support demand and prices for new homes.Existing-home sales rose 3.3% to annual rate of 5.69 million last month, the Commerce Department said, above views for 5.58 million. The median existing-home price rose 7.1% vs. a year earlier to $228,900. The supply of existing homes for sale retreated 7.1%.Solid job growth is boosting demand even as interest rates have risen somewhat from record lows in anticipation that President Trump's policies will boost economic growth and inflation, also spurring Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.Toll delivered 1,190 homes in its Q1, up 12% vs. a year earlier. But overall revenue fell because the average price sank 11.5% to $773,500.Orders rose 22% to 1,522 homes.

The builder sees 2017 EPS of $4-$4.50 a share, well above analyst targets of $3.74.Shares shot up 12.75% to 32.71 on the stock market today, rising to a 5-month high of 34.40 intraday and retaking their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors should wait to see if LGI can continue building the right side of a proper base and break out of a proper buy point.Meanwhile, other homebuilder stocks continued to advance, as optimism about housing demand and stronger economic growth offset mortgage rates that are above pre-election levels.Lennar stock rose 1.5% to 50.71, hitting its best level since December 2015. Shares are now extended from a 47.69 buy point cleared last month. D.R. Horton climbed 1.5% to a six-month best. KB Home advanced 0.8% to 18.19 intraday, still in range from a 17.48 buy point.

President Trump's comments about rebuilding America's infrastructure appeared to be the catalyst.Cement and wallboard provider Eagle Materials (EXP) rose 2.5% in above-average volume. The midcap stock bounced off its 50-day line. A breakout from a flat base Jan. 24 advanced 7% and then rolled over. Eagle Materials never triggered the 8% sell rule, but the down days in heavy volume suggested that at least some funds were lightening positions.Oil equipment maker Dril-Quip (DRQ) shot up 4% in strong volume. Zacks Investment Research upgraded the stock from hold to buy.Specialty alloys manufacturer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) added 2% in soft trade. The stock is trying to halt a four-week losing streak.Home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) posted a 4% gain in strong volume. The small-cap stock gapped up 24% Friday, a day after quarterly results were announced. A Guggenheim analyst affirmed its buy rating on Restoration Hardware and a price target of 45. The 45 price target represents a 37% gain from Monday's price.Trump's comments Monday suggested that infrastructure spending and increased military spending were top priorities. Reports of a delay in infrastructure spending appear now to have been wrong. ""We're going to start spending on infrastructure big,"" Trump said Monday. ""Not like we have a choice. It's not like, oh gee, let's hold it off.""As IBD's Big Picture noted late Thursday, the report based on anonymous sources ""could prove to be wrong"" despite the heavy selling on the rumor.Economic news Monday was mixed.Durable goods orders for January rose 1.8%, matching the Street's consensus estimate.Pending home sales in January dropped 2.8% vs. expectations for a 1.1% gain. The drop was blamed on a low supplies. However, the situation — low supply coupled with fairly brisk demand — is driving up prices.The Street apparently took that as a bullish sign for homebuilders. Meritage Homes (MTH) thrust 3%.  KB Homes (KBH) broke out with a 3% pop, but volume was only 13% above average. Lennar (LEN) also broke out in low volume as the stock gained 2%. Toll Brothers (TOL) padded last week's 7% pop with a 2% gain.  Pulte Group (PHM) broke out in average volume as it rose 2%. D.R. Horton (DHI) poked 2% higher in average volume.Coming up Tuesday: The second take on fourth-quarter GDP will be released before the opening bell. The Street expects a revision to 2.1%, vs. the first reading of 1.9%. The range of estimates runs from 2% to 3.1%.Other reports Tuesday will include the Redbook report on same-store sales at department stores, chain stores and discounters; the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index; the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index; The Conference Board's consumer sentiment survey; and the Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing gauge.

It was 4.09% in the week ended Jan. 19.Optimism about President Trump's plans to spur economic growth through tax cuts and looser regulation triggered a rise in Treasury yields and a corresponding increase in mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve is also projected to raise its benchmark interest rate several times this year.The supply of homes for sale increased to 5.8 months, the highest since September 2015, from 5 months in November.

636,PHM,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

637,PHM,"Durable goods orders sank much more than expected in December, a bad sign for the U.S. manufacturing outlook, and for fourth-quarter GDP. Pending-home sales also were weaker than expected at the end of last year. But the negative news was partially offset by a drop in jobless claims, which had climbed to a six-month high after the holiday season.New orders for durable goods tumbled 5.1% in December, the Commerce Department reported. The decline, led by a 12.4% drop in transportation orders was much worse than the expected 1.0% decrease. But even excluding transportation, orders fell 1.2%, compared to estimates of a 0.1% dip. November figures including and excluding transportation were revised down.Core capital goods orders, excluding defense and aircraft, fell 4.3% but were expected to be roughly flat from November.Core capital goods shipments plunged 6.6%, the most since 2008. That bodes ill for fourth-quarter GDP growth. Commerce will release that report on Friday, with economists already expecting sub-1% growth.Caterpillar (CAT) guided 2016 sales lower Thursday as the heavy equipment maker suffers from mining and emerging market weakness. Caterpiller's Q4 earnings fell sharply, but topped views. Its shares rose 3.5% in afternoon trade.Earlier this month General Electric (GE) reported lower profit that topped views while revenue well short. General Electric stock rose 1% Thursday afternoon.Pending home sales barely budged in December, rising 0.1%, the National Association of Realtors said. The slight uptick came in well below the 0.8% expected rise and looked even worse after a downward revision to November data.Pending sales, in which an existing-home contract has been signed but the sale isn’t yet final, fell in most parts of the country but increased in the Northeast. Low inventories of homes for sale and affordability issues, particularly in metro areas enjoying strong job growth, are holding back sales. On the upside, the recent decline in mortgage rates may add to demand.Tight supply should be good news for homebuilders. December new-home sales, released on Wednesday, rose to a 10-month high, nearly topping February's 8-year high. PulteGroup (PHM) and Meritage Homes (MTH) both reported better-than-expected earnings Thursday. PulteGroup stock rose 1.2% intraday while Meritage Homes leapt 12.1%.D.R. Horton (DHI) fell 0.5%. D.R. Horton reported mixed quarterly results on Monday and is down nearly 4% so far this week.Initial claims for jobless benefits fell 16,000 to 278,000 in the week through January 23, the Labor Department said. That was better than the 285,000 forecast.The four-week average of claims eased 2,250 to 283,000. But the number of people continuing to claim benefits rose 49,000 to 2.219 million.

Horton shares rose 4% on Friday and for the entire week. On Wednesday, shares fell intraday to their lowest since last May.Meritage Homes is expected to report a 5% EPS decline to $1.19, which be the fourth straight year-over-year slide. Revenue should rise 13.5% to $790.84 million, but that would be the smallest gain in five quarters.Meritage Homes stock rose 4.9% on Friday, but fell 2.6% for the week. On Wednesday, shares fell to their worst intraday level since June 2012.PulteGroup should report a 15.5% per-share profit drop to 49 cents.

Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM), Ryland Group (RYL) and M/I Homes (MHO) reported earnings before the stock market open Thursday, with D.R. Horton strong across the board as its peers missed views or delivered a blend of positive and negative results.Those reports came on top of the week's earlier news that sales of both new and existing homes declined in March, as rising prices and low inventories slowed the housing market's recovery.D.R. Horton, the No. 3 builder by market cap, got an 8% stock price lift Thursday, while M/I Homes jumped 9%, Pulte gained about 2% and Ryland rose about 3%. Other homebuilder stocks moved up by similar percentages, lifting IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group 3%.First-Time Buyers AppearAt D.R. Horton, which sells many homes under $250,000 to first-time buyers, CEO Donald Tomnitz said on a conference call with analysts that ""we are experiencing solid demand and profitability in the heart of our business.""D.R. Horton earned 38 cents a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in March. EPS was up from 32 cents the previous year and 4 cents above consensus views.The company's homebuilding revenue rose 22% to $1.7 billion. The average selling price increased 10% to $278,900, helping to push up the home-sales gross margin by 210 basis points to 22.5%. Orders rose 9% in homes and 20% in value.Pulte, which ranks second in market cap, logged Q1 earnings of 19 cents a share, down from 21 cents a year earlier and a penny below views. Revenue fell 3% to $1.12 billion, missing estimates for $1.2 billion. Home closings dropped 10.4%, while average selling prices of homes delivered rose 10.5% to $317,000. New orders slid 6%.""We experienced good demand in the quarter with generally stable to rising prices and gains in absorption paces suggestive of buyers coming back into the market especially in March,"" Pulte CEO Richard Dugas said on a conference call with analysts.

It was the second straight monthly decline and the lowest rate since July 2013.Builders had hoped that warmer weather in March might bring more activity. But a number of challenges have weighed on the industry, including supply constraints, rising prices and tight lending standards for buyers and builders.""We believe strict mortgage underwriting standards are a head wind for all our builders,"" Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless said in a research note Thursday.The median sales price for new homes in March climbed 11.2% from the prior month to $290,000.

651,PHM,"D.R. Horton (DHI) reported disappointing fiscal first-quarter revenue as home sales fell across the nation except for the southeastern region, though its backlog is well supplied for the upcoming spring home-selling season.The Fort Worth, Texas-based company earned 42 cents a share during its fiscal Q1, up 7.7% from a year earlier and beating by a penny estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. It's the sixth consecutive quarter of EPS growth for D.R. Horton, though earnings growth decelerated for the second straight quarter. Revenue rose 4.5% to $2.3 billion, missing estimates of $2.4 billion. It was the 18th straight quarter of revenue growth, but the weakest of those quarters.Homes closed rose 1% to 8,061 for the three-month period ended Dec. 31, compared to 7,973 homes a year earlier. Backlog rose 15% to 10,665 homes with a total value of $3.2 billion, up 16%. The company's cancellation rate fell one percentage point to 23%.Southeast region home sales rose 13.1% to 2,691, but fell everywhere else.Horton didn't give guidance in its earnings report, but Donald R. Horton, the company's chairman, said in a conference call that the company expects full-year revenue in a range between $12 billion and $12.5 billion.Shares closed down 4.7% on the stock market today. D.R. Horton has traded below its 200-day moving average since Jan. 7. Its current IBD Composite Rating is 94 out of 99, meaning it trades better than 94% of other publicly traded businesses.Other homebuilders' shares fell as markets turned lower Monday.

652,PHM,"The Pending Home Sales Index declined 0.9% in November to the lowest level since January, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. It was the third drop in four months, as higher home prices and a limited supply of homes for sales continue to curb demand.The index rose just 2.7% vs. November 2014, the smallest yearly gain since October 2014. Modest monthly gains in the Midwest and South were offset by larger declines in the Northeast and West.The forward-looking pending home sales gauge is based on existing-home contract signings that should translate into actual closed sales in a month or two. However, existing-home sales — based on closings — may rebound in December. Existing-home sales tumbled in November, in part due to new mortgage disclosure rules pushing some closings into December.Homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), PulteGroup (PHM) and LGI Homes (LGIH) have been cautious about boosting construction despite tight supply and favorable fundamentals, such as steady job growth and pent-up demand from millennials. Single-family starts did hit an eight-year high in November. D.R. Horton rose 0.2% to 32.67 on the stock market today, close to its recent nine-year high of 33.10. Lennar advanced 0.9%. PulteGroup was little changed, while LGI Homes popped 2.5%.

661,PHM,"New-home sales plunged 11.5% to a 468,000 annual pace in September, the Commerce Department said. It also revised down August figures by 33,000 to a 529,000 rate.September's figure sharply missed analyst forecasts of a 549,000 pace and seems at odds with the 10-year high for homebuilder confidence notched last week.Builder results have been mixed: Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) beat expectations and reported double-digit order increases, but Pulte (PHM) reported weaker-than-expected results as labor shortages and a slower pace of construction weighed on closings.The sharp drop in sales took the September supply of available homes to 5.8 months' worth, about in line with long-term averages. That should signal little reason for builders to increase their activity, although inventory remains extremely tight among existing homes.The median price rose 2.7% in September to $296,900. That's 14% higher than a year ago.

663,PHM,"D.R. Horton (DHI) is settling down and hugging support at its 50-day moving average. It's also forming a potential base. The stock has corrected a little less than 14%, paving the way for a possible flat base. But it needs a little more time, as a flat base takes at least five weeks to form.D.R. Horton has been volatile in recent months. It erased a double-digit gain from a breakout past a 28.80 buy point in a cup-with-handle base in August. A second try above the 28.80 trigger resulted in the same fate in late September.Since the stock rose less than 20% from the 28.80 buy point, a new base from here would be the second part of a base-on-base pattern.The stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D+, which is not inspiring. But the rating is at least stabilizing. What is inspiring is that overall fund ownership continued to improve in the third quarter; 964 mutual funds owned shares, up from 852 three periods before that.The highly rated Fidelity Contrafund took a position in the latest reported quarter.Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton is the nation's biggest homebuilder. According to the National Association of Homebuilders, the company sold 30,455 homes in 2014. This compared to about 21,000 homes for Lennar (LEN) and nearly 17,200 for Pulte (PHM).D.R. Horton builds homes under its namesake brand, as well as Express Homes and Emerald Homes labels.The firm's earnings grew 5% to 88% in the latest four quarters. Over the same period, sales rose 33% to 38%.The company has boosted its top line by double digits for 16 straight quarters.An improving job market and low interest rates are a couple of positives for the overall housing market.D.R. Horton is also benefiting from higher average prices.In its fiscal third quarter ended in June, its average sales price was $290,000, up 7% from a year ago.

664,PHM,"Buying a new-construction home is like purchasing a stock at its initial public offering. It's a bet on the future. Will the home turn out as you expected and be finished on time?

Do you understand the warranty and your rights?

"
666,PHM,"Housing starts ""look good and they're getting better,"" said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at Pittsburgh-based PNC.
"
667,PHM,"But are we back to a full building boom? No. Faucher said that builders are ""afraid of getting burned, so they're hesitant to expand."" And he says that the building industry is experiencing a labor shortage.
"
668,PHM,"The National Association of Realtors said in a news release earlier this month that homebuilding for all housing types ""is underperforming in roughly two-thirds of measured metro areas.""
"
669,PHM,"Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said, ""Even as the labor market began to strengthen, homebuilding failed to keep up and is now contributing to the stronger price appreciation and eroding affordability currently seen throughout the U.S.""
"
670,PHM,"Top U.S. homebuilders include Toll Bros. (TOL), KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN). (None of these builders, nor half a dozen other publicly held builders, agreed to be interviewed for this story.)
"
671,PHM,"Contracts, Upgrades, Schedules
"
672,PHM,"Construction schedules are one piece of complicated new-home contracts. Experts advise making sure that you know the schedule and, more importantly, any delay provisions built into the contract. Then expect the unexpected.
"
673,PHM,"Labor shortages may play a role, and delays are often ""weather-based,"" said Linda Wilson, broker-owner of Wilson & Co. Sotheby's International Realty in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Wilson says that buyers of new homes should consider having an agent or lawyer help them review the contract.
"
674,PHM,"""Some people are under the misconception that the builder's Realtor is working for them — and (he or she) is not,"" said Debbie Bennington, an agent with Dickson Realty in Reno, Nev.
"
675,PHM,"""Your agent can help you understand the contract, but the builder isn't going to change it,"" said Wilson. Most builders have a standard contract that's not negotiable.
"
676,PHM,"So buy from a reputable builder with strong financial backing, says Wilson. Also, be warned that the best prices come with the highest risk. Buying early, at phase one, will get you the best price, but you'll be living in a construction zone for a long time and likely without some promised amenities.
"
677,PHM,"""Each phase, the price goes up,"" said Wilson. ""If it's a new project, and you don't know much about it, then I'd wait for the second or third phase.""
"
678,PHM,"And figuring the final price of your home isn't easy either. Most builders offer a long list of upgrades — granite counters, hardwood floors, top-line appliances, etc. So make sure that your price estimate includes all the finishes that you want .
"
679,PHM,"Comb the contract to understand the nitty-gritty — price, deposit, schedule for payments, time for performance and ""what happens with delays and change orders,"" said David Jaffe, vice president, legal advocacy, with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C. And, Jaffe says, review what the contract says about disputes: How will they be handled, and is there an arbitration clause?
"
680,PHM,"Warranties And Inspections
"
681,PHM,"Often a contract will also include a ""cost escalation"" clause, said Eugene Graf, president of E.G. Construction in Bozeman, Mont. Graf says that costs for ""Sheetrock, shingles and plywood"" can change ""rapidly,"" so builders want the contract to cover possible material cost increases. He also said that banks lending on a new home often ""require a stated potential overage amount.""
"
682,PHM,"New homes usually come with a warranty, but the length can vary. Typically a builder will warrant all of his work for the first year. Beyond that, state laws set the rules for new home warranty coverage and length.
"
683,PHM,"Some buyers opt out of having their new homes inspected as they would an existing home, because they believe that the local building department has fully vetted it. Agents say that opting out can be a huge mistake. ""Residential building inspectors don't inspect everything. ... They don't inspect every home and every mechanical system,"" said Bennington.
"
684,PHM,"Graf, however, says that the building inspectors in his area are very thorough. He also has ""open job sites"" so a buyer ""can go see"" his or her home during construction. He added: ""It's one of our best selling features.""
"
685,PHM,"Jaffe says that unfortunately, some warranties are ""vague,"" and buyers and builders may disagree about what's a defect and what's normal aging. On its website, the NAHB offers information to help buyers understand the construction process and quality standards.
"
686,PHM,"Closing escrow and moving into a home with a major building flaw means that you won't have any leverage to get the builder to fix it quickly and to your satisfaction, and you'll be living through the repair.
"
687,PHM,"Wilson says that she had one client who was ready to move into a new home, but a home inspector found that the driveway drainage was wrong and, during a big rain, water would run into the home's garage. The buyer wouldn't close on the house until the driveway was fixed. The builder initially refused to fix the driveway but eventually agreed to tear it out and replace it.
"
688,PHM,"Amenities And HOA Rules
"
689,PHM,"Do you fully understand the association rules of your new development? What are the parking, landscaping and exterior maintenance requirements for all properties? Can you remodel? If so, what's the permit process? If it's a senior community, what are the restrictions about having family visit?

690,PHM,"""It's super exciting to buy new and early, but there are a lot of unknowns,"" said Bennington.
"
691,PHM,"Even the types of homes that a builder is putting up can change.
"
692,PHM,"During the bust, Bennington said, ""There were communities where they said they were going to build a certain size of home, and then they built smaller homes.""

At 45, it's still below the neutral 50 mark — but traffic has been above that mark only briefly, and that was just before the bubble burst.If homebuilders are bullish, it's probably a signal that housing is in good shape. It could also be a good sign for the rest of the economy, since a humming housing market propels so much other activity, especially hiring.Horton shares rose 2% to a 9-year high Monday. LGI fell lightly after making an all-time high; Lennar (LEN) rose 3% and PulteGroup (PHM) 1%.Meanwhile, in the mobile software industry, GrubHub (GRUB) is facing pressure in online food delivery from rivals led by ride-summoning service Uber, which recently began highlighting its big push into food delivery with a new look on its app.Uber had buried the UberEats app at the bottom of its site. But starting last week, UberEats has appeared prominently next to Uber's car-summoning icon. It's the latest salvo in the app-based food delivery service wars, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Kevin Kopelman in a research report on Monday.""We view this as a subtle but significant change recognizing food delivery as Uber's second major category ahead of a broader rollout,"" wrote Kopelman.Uber is hiring for its UberEats on-demand meal-delivery service in at least nine U.S. cities and could operate in as many as 15 cities in coming months, Kopelman says.""UberEATS remains small today in both geographic scope, food options and user adoption. However, Uber's recent moves signal some traction in markets where UberEATS has rolled out and point to aggressive expansion of food delivery as a core Uber service,"" Kopelman said.Uber is pioneering the ""ultrafast"" food category, offering a limited selection of prepared foods in thermal bags that couriers deliver within 10 minutes for a flat all-in delivery fee of $3 to $4.Competition from Uber and other companies that deliver food — which include Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — is pressuring GrubHub's order growth, which slowed to a 25% year-over-year gain in Q2 2015 from 33% in Q4 2014, wrote Kopelman. ""We note that new competitors, most notably Postmates, Yelp (YELP)-owned Eat24, DoorDash, Munchery, Caviar and UberEATS, are on track to capture 50% of U.S. industry growth in fiscal 2015 vs. 25% in 2014, and (excluding Uber) have raised $500 million year to date,"" Kopelman wrote.

It was the seventh-straight month of higher yearly tallies, NAR noted, suggesting March may have been a hard act to follow.Realtors see ""elevated levels of buying interest compared to a year ago,"" NAR said, and pointed to tighter inventory as a culprit for lower sales. Total inventory was up 10% in April, but still lower than a year ago, and the 5.3 months of supply on the market is lower than the long-term average of 6 months' worth.That's pressuring prices upward as well: the median price of $219,400 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and represented the biggest yearly gain in any month since January 2014.

Shaoul expects sales will pick up this year, as ""it's almost impossible to continue this economic cycle without a significant recovery in the new-home market.""Watching RatesHome purchases — and homebuilding stocks — fell in the summer as mortgage rates rose, though both have since rebounded as financing costs moderated again, said John Manley, who helps oversee $233.6 billion as chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management.It would be very unusual for sales to weaken significantly at this stage of the recovery, particularly with interest rates near record lows, Manley said.NVR and Standard Pacific Corp. (SPF) are among builders that reported strong earnings in the past three weeks, beating analysts' estimates. Toll Bros. is set to release first-quarter results Feb. 25. That day, home-improvement retailer Home Depot will report its fourth quarter, then Lowe's on Feb. 26.

893,PHM,"The Federal Reserve's unexpectedly hawkish policy outlook on Wednesday foiled a few homebuilder stock breakouts, at least temporarily, with D.R. Horton (DRI) and Lennar (LEN) slipping below buy-zone territory.But the recent news out of Washington isn't all bad for homebuilders. On Thursday, Wedbush upgraded Beazer Homes (BZH) to outperform from neutral, with a 15 price target, citing easier mortgage standards at Fannie Mae (FNMA).Analyst Jay McCanless said that Fannie Mae's policy change should be supportive for homebuilders, and especially so for Beazer, whose ""entry-level consumers"" stand to benefit most from lower lending standards.Wedbush also raised its price target for KB Home (KBH) to 24 from 22, with an outperform rating, citing looser credit from Fannie and expectations of a strong quarter when the homebuilder reports earnings in two weeks.Last week, Fannie Mae, which buys conforming mortgages from lenders and turns them into securities that carry an implicit government guarantee, said that it will ease debt-to-income requirements for borrowers starting July 29 to from 45% to 50%. That means total monthly debt payments can add up to half of income for qualified borrowers, though low credit scores can still doom a mortgage application.Beazer Homes rose 4.6% to 12.88 on the stock market today, off intraday highs of 13.27. KB Home dipped 1.3% to 21.68, a day after hitting its best levels since June 2013.Lennar fell 1.6% to 53.09, back below a 53.89 buy point cleared on Wednesday. D.R. Horton slid 1.6% to 33.80. D.R. Horton topped a 34.64 buy point intraday Wednesday, but closed below that level after the Fed announcement. Pulte Group (PHM) dipped 0.8% to 24.08, still above a 23.71 buy point cleared on Tuesday.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index out Thursday dipped to 67 in June from a downwardly revised 69 in May, but still signaled industry optimism about current and future sales. Readings over 50 are positive. While the gauge of buyer traffic dipped 2 points to 49, the main industry complaint has focused on ""an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single-family sector,"" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said.Even as the Fed has hiked rates three times, the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has climbed to No. 5 from No. 118 six months ago among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That's because market interest rates came have come down about 50 basis points since December, meaning financial conditions have eased as the Fed has tightened policy. But if the Fed is right about the need to hike rates four more times in the next 18 months, even as it shrinks its balance sheet comprised of $4.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury holdings, that benign trend for housing will begin to reverse.RELATED:Fed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsHomebuilders Surge; Pulte Still In Buy RangeHomebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market & Real Estate News   
"
894,PHM,"Thanks to the housing market recovery, many homebuilders delivered solid financial gains last year. Now comes the tricky part: sustaining that momentum in 2014, when the industry might see a few more head winds.
"
895,PHM,"Toll Bros. (TOL) figures to be one of the builders that keeps racking up robust gains this year even as the prospect of rising mortgage rates, tough prior-year comparisons and economic uncertainty rein in growth at other companies.
"
896,PHM,"Toll is expected to deliver 66% earnings growth and 48% revenue growth for its 2014 fiscal year, which ends in October, according to a consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
"
897,PHM,"That compares favorably against the prospects of most other publicly traded builders, including three — PulteGroup (PHM), Ryland Group (RYL) and MDC Holdings (MDC) — that are expected to report lower earnings per share in 2014.
"
898,PHM,"One of Toll's advantages, at least for now, is its focus on high-end homes, analysts say. Compared to the midpriced and first-time markets, the luxury market is less vulnerable to rising mortgage rates, higher home prices and worries that jobs and the economy aren't growing fast enough to significantly boost sales.
"
899,PHM,"""The more affluent customers have more confidence right now,"" said David Urani, analyst at Wall Street Strategies. ""They're likely to be less concerned about volatility in the mortgage rate, or macro factors. These things don't hit Toll Bros. quite as hard as other builders.""
"
900,PHM,"High-End Demand
"
901,PHM,"He says that while other builders are ""waiting for first-time buyers to come back to the marketplace"" — or for middle-class Americans to gain more confidence — Toll Bros. has pursued an aggressive growth strategy aimed at filling high demand for luxury properties.
"
902,PHM,"""Toll Bros. is the only real big public builder in the high-end space — they are by far the big fish in that market,"" Urani said. ""They've worked to get inventory out there, and they have the capital and resources to do so.""
"
903,PHM,"To get more inventory on the market, Toll has been busy buying up property.
"
904,PHM,"Its latest deal announcement came Wednesday, as Toll said that in a joint venture with GTIS Partners, it has acquired Sienna South — the last major undeveloped parcel in what it calls one of Houston's most successful master planned communities, Sienna Plantation.
"
905,PHM,"The 3,700-acre Sienna South site can accommodate up to 10,000 single-family homes. Toll said the joint venture will develop about 6,500 home lots to be sold to local, regional and national homebuilders. And Toll may acquire up to 1,750 of them for its own homebuilding over the life of the community.
"
906,PHM,"Home sales in Sienna South are expected to top $2.6 billion at full buildout. Site development could begin in April and sales to homebuyers in 2015. Toll already has three communities in Sienna Plantation.
"
907,PHM,"""Toll Brothers is using its strong liquidity position to secure the most sought-after locations,"" analysts at Zacks Equity Research noted in a report. ""The housing market in Houston is currently gaining momentum as demand escalates.""
"
908,PHM,"The Sienna South deal followed Toll's November purchase of the homebuilding business of privately held Shapell Industries for about $1.6 billion in cash. That deal gave Toll greater access to affluent real estate markets in California.
"
909,PHM,"Shapell's land portfolio consists of around 5,200 home sites in affluent and high-growth markets such as the San Francisco Bay area, metro Los Angeles, Orange County and Carlsbad.
"
910,PHM,"""The acquisition of Shapell Homes significantly increases Toll's exposure to key California markets,"" noted Peter Martin, analyst at JMP Securities.
"
911,PHM,"Meanwhile, Toll Bros. has also worked to increase its presence in urban markets.
"
912,PHM,"Tapping Urban Affluence
"
913,PHM,"Last year it bought a pair of development sites in New York — one in the the Midtown East area of Manhattan, and the second farther downtown in SoHo.
"
914,PHM,"Both sites are being developed into mixed-use spaces featuring luxury condominium residences and retail. They are part of Toll's growing portfolio of properties in and around the Big Apple.
"
915,PHM,"""That's been a boost because many of these units are over $1 million, and they have generated extra sales in the near term,"" analyst Urani said.
"
916,PHM,"In November, Toll began construction of River Parc, a 287-unit luxury rental apartment project in the Capitol Riverfront area of Washington, D.C. Toll has a long history of development in nearby areas, but River Parc is the company's first project inside Washington.
"
917,PHM,"As Toll has grabbed a bigger foothold in affluent markets, its average home prices have risen as well. During its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in October, the average price of homes delivered was $703,000 vs. $651,000 the prior quarter and $582,000 the prior year.
"
918,PHM,"On a fourth quarter conference call with analysts, Toll Executive Chairman Robert Toll said a shortage of approved sites, labor constraints in some markets and a lack of capital for small and privately held builders have combined to create a shortage of luxury homes.
"
919,PHM,"""This supply constraint could lead to a further escalation in luxury home prices above and beyond normal trends until industry production returns to historic equilibrium,"" Toll said.
"
920,PHM,"His company expects to deliver between 5,100 and 6,100 homes this fiscal year. The average delivered price per home should be between $670,000 and $720,000.
"
921,PHM,"In its fiscal 2013 Q4, Toll delivered 1,485 homes, a gain of 36% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher demand and low competition for luxury homes.
"
922,PHM,"Quarterly revenue rose 65% to $1.045 billion, topping estimates for $1.028 billion. It was the seventh straight quarter of double-digit profit growth. Adjusted earnings came in at 54 cents a share, down from $2.35 the prior year, when Toll enjoyed a much bigger tax benefit. Results were still well above consensus estimates for 43 cents.
"
923,PHM,"Gross margin in the quarter was 25.4%, up from 24.6% the prior year. Operating margin rose to 12.3% from 8.3% a year earlier. Price increases helped both figures.

924,PHM,"Toll is expected to report fiscal Q1 results the week of Feb. 17-21. Analysts anticipate EPS of 19 cents, up from 3 cents a year earlier.

"
927,PHM,"After order growth slowed in the summer and fall as mortgage rates rose, homebuilder Lennar (LEN) is expecting a ""strong spring selling season"" as the housing market continues on a ""solid recovery.""
"
928,PHM,"That outlook, stated in a recent government filing, followed a November-ending fourth quarter that saw year-over-year orders slow to 13% from 15% in the third, 27% in the second and 35% in the first.
"
929,PHM,"Miami-based Lennar, the largest homebuilder by market cap, sells in 18 states, including Florida, Texas and California.
"
930,PHM,"Though order growth slowed later in the year, Lennar ""performed better than most other publicly traded builders,"" said analyst Megan McGrath of MKM Partners.
"
931,PHM,"""Everybody is going to be waiting to see how the early weeks of the spring selling season fare,"" she said.
"
932,PHM,"After Lennar, the next largest homebuilders by market cap are PulteGroup (PHM), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros. (TOL)

"
935,PHM,"Fundamentals key to home sales are also ""still good,"" McGrath said. ""We still have a lack of inventory and the economy is slowly improving.""
"

"
937,PHM,"For the full year, delivered homes jumped 33% to 18,290 homes and revenue grew 45% to $5.9 billion.

939,PHM,"The $307,335 average price of a Lennar home in the fourth quarter was 18% higher than in the year-earlier period.
"
940,PHM,"Some analysts expect continued tight credit, rising mortgage rates and lackluster job growth to mitigate home-price gains in 2014 compared to 2013.
"
941,PHM,"Lennar expects its average selling price this year to rise in the mid-single digits.
"
942,PHM,"In its recent filing, Lennar said it would not only raise prices in 2014 but also reduce incentives to offset rising material, labor and land costs.
"
943,PHM,"Most large builders in recent years have been tending to their balance sheets to shore up profits while waiting for a more robust recovery. Lennar has been especially aggressive on that front.
"

947,PHM,"Besides lower incentives and higher selling prices, Lennar benefitted from a greater number of homes sold in higher-margin communities, where land was bought after Nov. 30, 2008.
"
948,PHM,"Lennar jumped into land acquisitions early, buying on the cheap during the downturn before prices started rising again. As RBC Capital analyst Robert Wetenhall put it, Lennar has a land portfolio ""that is widely regarded as the best asset base in the industry."" He noted that it had 154,000 owned and optioned lots at year-end.

949,PHM,"RBC Capital has an ""outperform"" rating on Lennar, and cites its ""seasoned management team"" for assembling ""the premier land position in the industry.""
"
950,PHM,"On Feb. 5, Goldman Sachs raised its outlook on Lennar from neutral to ""conviction"" buy, its highest rating. The upgrade was based partly on potential profits, especially in 2015, from Lennar's undervalued ancillary businesses — Rialto Investments, FivePoint Communities and a multifamily rental apartment division.
"
951,PHM,"Lennar says the multifamily apartment business is still in start-up mode, and does not expect a ""meaningful contribution"" until ""beyond fiscal 2014.""

1041,PHM,"The bullish argument for Pulte rests largely on its huge inventory of land.
"
1042,PHM,"Pulte, which has built homes in 29 states, currently has a roughly eight-year supply of lots on which to build, estimates McGrath. Rising land prices should give Pulte the opportunity to expand margins, as it has locked in fixed costs.

"
1048,PHM,"Current housing demand is coming largely from repeat buyers, not first-time buyers. But much of Pulte's land might better serve those first-time buyers willing to live a bit further out from core cities. And demand from this sort of buyer is still relatively quiescent. ""When the first-time buyers come back into the market, they will use that land,"" said McGrath.

1053,PHM,"Homebuilders rallied Friday as weak payroll data sent 10-year bond yields down, potentially helping to keep mortgage rates low.
"
1054,PHM,"Mortgage applications for home purchases have fallen since the summer as interest rates inched up in anticipation of the Fed's gradual tapering of bond buybacks, pressuring builder stocks.
"
1055,PHM,"Pulte Group (PHM), Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros. (TOL), the four largest homebuilders by market cap, rose more than 2% by early afternoon in the stock market today. KB Home (KBH) jumped more than 3%.
"
1056,PHM,"The overall stock market fell intraday Friday, before rising ahead of the closing bell, after the December jobs report came in much weaker than expected with only 74,000 workers hired vs. the 196,000 analysts had expected. Weather may have been a factor. It was the smallest gain since January 2011.
"
1057,PHM,"But the disappointing jobs report has ""silver linings"" for housing demand in 2014, said Jed Kolko, chief economist with real estate web site Trulia.com (TRLA), in an email.

1058,PHM,"He noted that more young adults were working and job growth in ""clobbered"" metro areas such as Tampa, Orlando and Fort Lauderale, Fla., Las Vegas, Nev., and Phoenix has picked up.
"
1059,PHM,"The ""prime age"" for housing demand is the 25- to 34-year-old group, Kolko said, and employment in that group rose to 75.4% in December, after dipping below 75% earlier this year.

1060,PHM,"""For the economy overall, the jobs report was disappointing, but better news for housing demand going into 2014,"" he said.

1061,PHM,"Still, young buyers have a long road ahead since the December rate was closer to the low point in the recession than to the pre-bubble level of 78% to 80%, Kolko added.

1083,PHM,"A couple of months ago Tri Pointe Homes was a smallish homebuilder with a heavy concentration in California and little fanfare on Wall Street.Today the company is poised to become one of the nation's 10 biggest builders as it prepares to move into a handful of new, high-growth markets from one coast to the other.For that, Tri Pointe (TPH) can thank its proposed buyout of Weyerhaeuser Co.'s (WY) homebuilding division in a $2.7 billion deal announced Nov. 4.The acquisition brings Tri Pointe around 27,000 lots and five brands: Pardee Homes in Southern California and Nevada; Trendmaker Homes in Texas; Maracay Homes in Arizona; Winchester Homes in the Washington, D.C., metro area; and Quadrant Homes in the Puget Sound region of Washington.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2014. When it does, Tri Pointe would have a market cap of around $2.5 billion, going by current stock levels. That would move it into the top 10 among U.S. homebuilders. The company's current market cap is about $600 million.Good Supply Of LandOfficials involved in the deal said the Weyerhaeuser unit, known as Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., or Wreco, will give Tri Pointe nine years' worth of land and lot supply.According to industry reports, that compares favorably with the roughly 7.4 years of average supply for leading U.S. homebuilders like Pulte Group (PHM), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN).Part of Tri Pointe's new supply will be in and around large urban markets such as Las Vegas, Houston, Phoenix and Seattle.A majority of the lots — more than 16,000 — are in California, where available land in top markets is shrinking.On a conference call with analysts, Tri Pointe CEO Doug Bauer said the combined company will give Tri Pointe ""a stronger and deeper California market position, a relatively high average-selling-price product line (and) land positions and brand recognition in the nation's most attractive markets.""Wall Street reacted favorably to the news. Tri Pointe's stock, which touched a low of 13.43 on Oct. 9, has since rallied about 35% and currently trades near 18. The stock went public in late January at an IPO price of $17.Even before the deal was announced, Tri Pointe was seeing sales increase sharply. For the past five quarters, revenue has risen by at least triple-digit percentages from a year ago. The Wreco assets should kick growth into an even higher gear, analysts say.""The acquisition of about 27,000 lots in several of the nation's best housing markets will permit Tri Pointe Homes to continue its robust growth pace,"" Brendan Lynch, analyst at Sidoti & Co., noted in a report.""In addition to bolstering inventory, we think Wreco's land .. . will contribute to gross margin expansion to 23.5% in 2014 and 24% in 2015, vs. our call for 22% in 2013,"" Lynch added.Under the terms, Weyerhaeuser shareholders will get 130 million shares, or 80.5% of the combined company. Tri Pointe will get 19.5%.However, Tri Pointe's management will run the firm. Bauer will remain as CEO and Barry Sternlicht will continue as chairman. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group owns a large stake in Tri Pointe.The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal is part of a recent trend that has seen homebuilders use acquisitions to gain quick entry into new markets.In July, Ryland Group (RYL) made its fourth acquisition in a year when it bought the operations and assets of Cornell Homes, a developer in Philadelphia, western New Jersey and Delaware.In September, Meritage Homes (MTH) announced its acquisition of Phillips Builders, a Nashville-based builder.Weyerhaeuser, a timberland owner that makes wood, container board and paper products, began exploring the idea of selling its homebuilding unit in June.In a statement at the time, Weyerhaeuser CEO Dan Fulton said that ""given the improving fundamentals of the housing market, we believe now is a prudent time to explore strategic alternatives for this business.""The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal was structured as a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust, which allowed Tri Pointe to buy a larger firm while Weyerhaeuser shareholders would own the majority of shares.When the deal closes, Tri Pointe will have a chance to expand well beyond its current market, which mainly focuses on houses in California and Colorado that sell for $300,000 to $1.5 million.""We have accelerated our long-term plan to be a leading regional homebuilder in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets,"" Bauer said on the conference call. ""The combination of Wreco's local market knowledge and Tri Pointe's strong and established history of success should result in a powerful and focused homebuilding company.""Prices And Revenue GrowingHe made those comments following Tri Pointe's third-quarter earnings release. The company posted earnings of 15 cents a share, topping estimates for 9 cents. Revenue rose more than 480% year over year to $58.5 million, above views for $44.9 million.The average selling price of homes delivered climbed 57% to $624,000 as Tri Pointe benefited from the opening of three communities in Southern California.New home orders nearly doubled to 135 from 74 a year earlier, while homebuilding gross margins improved to 23% from 11.7% the prior year.Tri Pointe said it will have nine active communities by the end of 2013. It expects to open 20 to 24 new communities in 2014, excluding the Wreco assets.""We project that Tri Pointe will sell all of the remaining homes in a few of the nine communities that are open, resulting in an active community count of 27 at year-end 2014,"" analyst Lynch noted.Analysts expect Tri Pointe to post full-year EPS of 47 cents in 2013 and $1.09 in 2014.

1147,PHM,"The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped in June to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70 as tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are coming in the way of buyers’ affordability, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Shares of homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) fell 1.6%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively, on Monday. Apart from builders’ perception, looming trade war concerns after China's retaliation to U.S. tariffs pulled Wall Street down modestly yesterday.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period, given the robust consumer demand.Key TakeawaysHomebuilder sentiment fell two points in June to 68 and all three indices — present sales, future sales and buyer traffic — declined one point. In the words of NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, LA, ""builders are increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability. Record-high lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017.""Notably, all three Housing Market Index components fell one point in June. Current sales conditions decreased to 75. Buyer traffic decreased to 50 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped to 76.Meanwhile, challenges like inventory shortage are still prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country, thereby affecting affordability. Additionally, mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields, in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed. Rising mortgage rates may dilute demand for new homes.Construction Prices Are SoaringApart from tariffs on lumber, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also stirred concerns among investors about the construction sector. According to an Associated Builders and Contractors (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May construction material prices increased 2.2% month over month, representing the largest monthly increase in 10 years (since May 2008). On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 8.8%.ABC Chief Economist Anirban Basu is concerned about rapidly rising construction materials prices and stated that current solid economic expansion may eventually disappear as inflationary pressures become increasingly apparent. He added that real estate and construction cycles are particularly vulnerable to increases in borrowing costs.Myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, as evident from the 17.1% year-to-date decline against a 4.1% rise of the S&P 500 Composite. Even big names like Lennar, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home and NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) have plunged 17.9%, 17.9%, 10.9%, 19.6% and 11.5%, respectively, so far this year.Robust Demand Raises HopeDespite June’s drop, NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz remains optimistic about the industry given solid housing demand (mainly for single-family construction), improved economic growth and continued job creation.Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder sentiment in the Northeast rose 2 points to 57, while the West and Midwest remained unchanged at 76 and 65, respectively. Sentiment in the South fell 1 point to 71.It is to be noted that any reading above 50 indicates that more builders expect sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has remained above 60 since September 2016. Growth is expected to accelerate in the coming period as the industry starts to feel the impact of bigger after-tax paychecks along with a strong job market.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1148,PHM,"As expected, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Moreover, chances of two more rate hikes this year are high. The rate hike was imminent given the solid economic scenario backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth along with a rise in prices.The unemployment rate fell to an 18-year low in May to 3.8% from the previous month. For the first time since 2000, the number of job openings now exceeds the number of workers to fill in the positions. Fed expects the rate of unemployment rate to be 3.6% this year, down from 3.8% expected earlier.A tight labor market invariably leads to an increase in wages, with total wages up 2.7% in the last 12 months. Again, more income in the hands of individuals leads to increased demand for goods and services which in turn leads to higher prices. In the 12-month period through May, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up 2.8%, its biggest year-on-year rise since early 2012. The core CPI measure, which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, rose 2.2% from May 2017. Fed expects inflation to rise 2.1% for this year through 2020.Therefore, to put a check on inflation, an interest hike was quite imperative. Though an increase in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing, Fed officials are confident that the economy won’t be affected by higher borrowing costs. The committee sees economic growth of 2.8% for 2018, highlighting an increase of 0.1 percentage point from the estimates issued in March 2018.Impact of Rising Rates on HomebuildersWith two more hikes expected this year along with three in 2019, investors in the housing space are jittery. Shares of prominent homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) lost around 4% while that of PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report) fell 6.7% and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) slipped about 7%.A hike in the benchmark Federal Funds’ target rate will probably lead to a rise in mortgage rates in the remainder of 2018 or thereafter. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.Will This Lower Affordability?The rise in interest rates comes at a time when home prices are increasing owing to supply constraints and increased raw materials costs. Builders are spooked by higher aluminum and steel costs, thanks to the newly-imposed tariffs. This coupled with increased lumber prices owing to an import tariff is denting builders’ margins, prompting them to bump up prices. Further, troubles like labor shortage and limited land availability continue to make things difficult.Additionally, the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market. Higher interest rates will only flare up such issues but will also delay home purchases by millennials.Total mortgage applications fell 1.5% in the week ending Jun 8 as is evident from the latest Mortgage Bankers Association report. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 2%.Are Housing Stocks a Safe Shelter Now?Though myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, as is evident from the 17.2% year-to-date decline against a 3.9% rise of the S&P 500 Composite, the larger picture is convincingly strong.Consumer demand is robust as is evident from the new home sales data that point to an 11.6% increase year over year in April despite the month-to-month irregularity. Housing starts were up 10.5% from April 2017 buoyed by a 7.2% increase in single-family homes and a 19.1% rise in apartments. Again, permits were 7.7% above the April 2017 level prompted by a 7.9% rise in single-family homes and 6.4% growth in buildings with five units or more. Also, builder confidence remained above 50 in the first five months of 2018, indicative of a favorable outlook.The solid momentum is expected to continue in the rest of 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence.Picking the Right StocksInvestors can consider four homebuilding stocks that are currently trading at a discount and have ample room to run.

1149,PHM,"Undoubtedly, the overall outlook for the U.S. housing industry remains positive, with a healthy economy and strong job market helping the demand side of the equation. However, the limited supply of homes for sale is the biggest issue facing the market right now and will prevail in the balance of 2018.Meanwhile, there are other factors that can deal a fresh blow to the housing industry. The U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has spurred concerns among investors about certain U.S. sectors, particularly Construction.Although a healthy job market and an impressive supply-demand balance will probably draw buyers, rising interest and mortgage rates -- as well as land and labor shortages -- raise concerns, as do tedious underwriting standards. Intensifying competition also poses a threat.It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at the dampeners before investing in this space. Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years.Trump Tariff & Rising Material Costs to Shake the IndustryConstruction materials’ prices continued to rise in March, after a notable spike in February. Meanwhile, tariffs on steel and other goods could push up construction costs.According to an Associated Builders and Contractors (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”), March construction material prices increased 0.8% month over month. On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 5.8%, marking the steepest rise since 2011.“Prices increased for many items in March, even before tariffs announced for steel, aluminum, and additional items imported from China have taken effect,” said Ken Simonson, AGC of America’s chief economist.Notably, in March 2018, U.S. President Trump has announced hefty new tariffs for imports of steel, at 25%, and 10% for aluminum in an attempt to boost U.S. manufacturers. The proposal, which is in sync with Trump’s America First policy, however, will hit the Construction sector that accounted for 40% of U.S. steel demand in 2017 (as per the data provider Statista).Steel is an integral part of the supply chain and widely used in every part of it, from sourcing raw material to construction and manufacturing activities as well as for freight purposes.An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for homebuilders already grappling with increased cost thanks the recent imposition of lumber tariff. Notably, in 2017, tariff was imposed on lumber, another major input material in the construction sector. The tariff imposed in retaliation to Canada's restrictions on the import of U.S. dairy products, averaged 20.83% on Canadian lumber imports, which are used mostly for home building in the United States.Association officials warn contractors that the Trump administration’s additional proposed tariffs might further increase construction costs, resulting in potential project delays and cancellations.Labor/Land Shortage Continues to HurtApart from the rising material costs, the U.S. housing industry is already challenged by a shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. Limited supply of homes for sale has been the biggest issue facing the market and the problem will continue, particularly in the entry-level market.Per a recent report by the National Association of Realtors (NARs), the supply of existing homes in April 2018 decreased 6.3% from April 2017 but increased 9.8% month over month. It has fallen year over year for 35 consecutive months.As such, it will take only four months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months’ supply for a healthy market. Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well.Also, the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry, as demand continues to scale up. Rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as these limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortage is resulting in higher wages, while land prices are inflating due to limited availability. There could be more inflation ahead. This is eating into homebuilders’ margins.The impact of labor/land shortage is twofold. On the one hand, residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers. On the other hand, to make up for rising labor costs, homebuilders are being compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry-level homebuyers. In April, first-time buyers comprised 33% of sales, which is down from 34% a year ago but up from 30% in March.Rising land and labor costs have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) and others. Lennar, PulteGroup and Toll Brothers carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Fed’s Hawkish Stance, Rising Interest Rates & Volatile Mortgage RatesMinutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and were released on May 23, reveal that Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged, in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%.The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point. The target range for benchmark short-term interest rate stands between 1.5% and 1.75%. This was the sixth-rate hike undertaken by the Fed since 2015. The Fed expects to increase interest rates two more times in 2018. Fed officials now project a median federal funds rate of 2.9% by the end of 2019, which indicates three rate hikes in 2019 against two predicted in the last Fed meeting in December 2017. They expect the rate to move up to 3.4% in 2020 from the previous expectation of 3.1%.Meanwhile, mortgage rates, which loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed.The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.61% for the week ended May 17, 2018, the highest level since May 2011, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.The rise in interest rates comes at a time when values of homes are marching up with higher demand and lesser supply. The situation could be detrimental to first-time buyers, raising affordability issues. This is evident from the latest report of Mortgage Bankers Association, unveiling the seasonally adjusted weekly survey for the week ending May 18, 2018. The report stated that total mortgage applications fell by 2.6% from a week earlier. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 4%, the MBA reported. The refinance index is currently at its lowest level since December 2000.Speculation of further rate hikes is niggling investors in this space. Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the upcoming rise in mortgage rates given the job market strength, its influence on the industry is undeniable and uncertain.However, with the Fed announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds’ target rate, mortgage rates will probably rise in the balance of 2018 or thereafter. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.Additionally, the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market. Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials.Rising Prices Hurting AffordabilityRising material prices, along with shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor are creating upward pressure on home prices and hindering a stronger housing recovery.April’s median sales price of existing homes grew 5.3% from the comparable period a year ago to $257,900, marking the 74th straight month of year-over-year gains. In 2017, prices increased 5.8%, rising for the sixth straight year. Additionally, the median sales price of new homes sold in April was $312,400, 0.4% higher than a year ago.Overall, rising prices may keep home buyers at bay with many postponing their search for the time being.Sales Continue to FalterMost recent data showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped in April after gaining in March. In fact, new home sales faltered in three of the last four months this year, suggesting the travails of the housing market in winning back momentum. Housing starts and building permits also fell 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, in the month.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 units, as per data released on May 23 by the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, sales data for the prior three months was also revised down. The revisions revealed that sales in the first three months of the year were not as strong as earlier reported.Moreover, existing-home sales faltered in April on both a monthly and annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors, after moving upward for two straight months.Total existing-home sales decreased 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million in April from 5.60 million in March. With last month’s decline, sales are now 1.4% below a year ago and have fallen year-over-year for two straight months.We would prefer to avoid M/I Homes, Inc.

1150,PHM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PulteGroup, Inc. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts PulteGroup, Inc.’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 13.7) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PulteGroup, Inc. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 9.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PulteGroup, Inc.’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PulteGroup, Inc. has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PulteGroup, Inc. currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PHM a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for PulteGroup, Inc. is just 0.5, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0.7. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PHM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though PulteGroup, Inc. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives PHM a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen nearly 5.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 6.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PulteGroup, Inc. Price and Consensus  PulteGroup, Inc. Price and Consensus | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, PulteGroup, Inc. is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LinePulteGroup, Inc. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 11% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1151,PHM,"Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22, before the opening bell. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15.17% in the trailing four quarters.Toll Brothers mostly caters to the luxury move-up buyers, who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger homes. These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. Thus, it enjoys an edge over other homebuilding companies, thereby resulting in strong earnings, revenues, contracts and backlog growth. Notably, the lack of competition in the luxury new home market proves beneficial for Toll Brothers.Toll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Toll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Toll Brothers Inc. Quote Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementThe 2018 outlook for the U.S. homebuilding industry is quite compelling, given the affordable interest rates and tight inventory, indicating pent-up demand. The company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 marked the 14th consecutive period of year-over-year growth in contract dollars and units, with 20% or more growth recorded in the last few quarters.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects home deliveries between 1,825 and 1,925 units, at an average price of $825,000-$850,000. This compares with the year-ago level of 1,638 units. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for home deliveries stands at 1,886 units, implying 32.5% sequential and 15.1% year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for average selling price of $838 million indicates an increase from $826 million in the prior quarter and $832 million a year ago.Now, for the company’s gross margin, Toll Brothers expects adjusted gross margin to be approximately 22.8%, implying a decline of 90 basis points (bps) sequentially and 150 bps year over year.The shortage of buildable lots is limiting home production, thereby lowering the inventory of homes, both new and existing. Additionally, rising building materials and labor costs are growing concerns for the company’s margins. Land prices are inflating due to limited availability. The rising labor and material costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) among others.The company expects SG&A expenses at approximately 10.6% of the revenues. This compares favorably with the year-ago figure of 10.8% and 13.4% in the preceding quarter.Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $1.57 billion, implying 14.8% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 2.7% year over year.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Toll Brothers is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Toll Brothers has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Toll Brothers has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1153,PHM,"PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30, before the market opens.Last quarter, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters, resulting in average earnings beat of 8.1%.Let us take a look at the factors that are likely to influence the company’s Q4 results.Healthy Housing Momentum to Boost RevenuesHealthy buyer demand and good traffic point toward a strong fourth quarter revenues for the company. Homebuilders, like PulteGroup have been doing well courtesy of steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation, and a limited supply of inventory. Though housing industry data were not impressive last December, owing to an extreme cold weather, the industry reported robust gains in October and November. These positive trends point at strong demand in the to-be-reported quarter and beyond.Apart from positive industry fundamentals, we remain encouraged by PulteGroup’s prudent land investment strategy. The company expects to realize higher returns on invested capital, given the plans to moderate the rate of land spends, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate inventory turns.Homebuilding revenues increased 11.7% in the first nine months of 2017. This segment revenue comprise of Home sale and Land sale revenues, both of which increased 11.6% and 78.2% in the first nine months of 2017. The trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well, given the strong demand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.7 billion reflects growth of 30.9% sequentially and 9.4% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Home sale revenues reflects growth of 12% year over year but 15.6% decline for Land sale revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for closings stands at 6,547 units (up 5.6%) and that of average selling price is pegged at $415,000.On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $62 million indicates an increase of 32.1% from the prior quarter and 14.8% year over year.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.79 billion, implying 11.8% growth.Rising Costs Hurt MarginsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins, as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Home sales’ gross margin decreased 80 basis points (bps) year over year in the last quarter of 2017. PulteGroup expects gross margin in the lower end of 23.6-24.1% range, implying a decrease of 120 bps to 70 bps for the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, PulteGroup is taking actions to improve its operating and financial performance. These initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies. The initiatives are expected to drive meaningful profits for PulteGroup in the to-be-reported quarter.The solid improvement in the top line along with cost reduction program is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 84 cents, reflecting a 25.4% increase from the prior-year quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that PulteGroup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1154,PHM,"The U.S. housing industry has just come off a great year. A last minute boost was the icing on the cake, with homebuilding optimism hitting a record level on the tax cuts announcement. In the first month of 2018, buyer demand and homebuilder optimism look strong. And these factors remain in place despite a disappointing read for housing starts for December.In fact, cumulative housing numbers for 2017 are quite impressive and indicate that another strong year for the industry is in the offing. Investing in stocks from the sector looks like an increasingly profitable option at this point.U.S. Housing Had a Great 2017According to real estate database firm Zillow, the value of U.S. housing stock as a whole increased by 6.5% or $2 trillion in 2017. This takes the total value of all homes located within the United States to $31.8 trillion. This increase in cumulative housing value was the fastest recorded since 2013, a time when the sector was still recovering from the Great Recession.As of now, Los Angeles is the most valuable housing market in the country, accounting for a total value of $2.7 trillion. Data from Zillow also reveals that New York comes in second with a cumulative value of $2.6 trillion.  In fact, the 10 most highly valued metro areas make up around 36% of the cumulative value of U.S. housing.This increase was primarily due to a spike in prices and a concurrent shortage in housing supply. According to real estate data provider Redfin, U.S. home prices increased by 7% over 2017 to a median sales price of $284,500.Meanwhile, sales registered a 1.7% increase over 2016 while only 2.6 months of supply was reported in December. Such a state of supplies indicates that the market is heavily skewed in favor of sellers.Prospects Remain Strong Although Starts DeclineMeanwhile, the year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts numbers. According to the Department of Commerce, housing starts declined by 8.2% in December, the largest percentage drop recorded since Nov 2016. However, industry watchers believe that the downturn experienced in December is likely to be temporary. Further, housing possibly felt the chill from December’s brutally low temperatures.Optimists point toward the 2.4% increase in homebuilding to 1.202 million units in 2017. This is the highest level recorded in a decade. Strong economic growth, a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry.Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes. Also, homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes. These are units which still do not have a buyer. And this phenomenon has not been witnessed since the last housing boom which preceded the recession of 2008.  Our ChoicesIt would be best to ignore the recent poor reading of housing starts given that several positives remain in place for the sector. Homebuilding sentiment continues to linger near the 18-year high hit in December. Further, buyer demand remains high even as supplies constraints continue to exist, skewing the market heavily in favor of sellers. Taken together, these factors ensure that housing stocks remain a strong investment option in 2018.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

In addition, PulteGroup’s strategic pricing programs allow buyers to select the lots and options that they value the most, resulting in higher levels of house options and lot premiums. The company is also adjusting contents of its homes and is building smaller floor plans to curtail construction costs.Also, the latest positive housing data reassures the industry’s strength, courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and ongoing recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is driving the momentum.In fact, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has gained 66.9% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s gain of 17.6%. Moreover, a good industry rank (top 26% out of more than 256 industries) signals that the companies in this space are likely to benefit from broader factors in the near term.ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortages are leading to higher wages while land prices are on the rise owing to limited availability. This is denting homebuilders’ margins. Home sales’ gross margin decreased 80 basis points year over year to 23.9% in the third quarter of 2017.PulteGroup’s homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions. Natural disasters and inclement weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials and dent demand for new homes.Share Price MovementShares of PulteGroup have gained 85.7% year to date, outperforming 67.8% gain of the industry it belongs to. The price performance has been backed by an impressive earnings history. PulteGroup surpassed earnings in all of the past four quarters, the average beat being 8.09%.  Though earnings estimates for 2017 declined 3.5%, it increased 2.2% for 2018 over the last 60 days. This indicates analysts’ apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future but the stock’s growth story might impress over the long term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the sector are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) and Armstrong World Industries Inc (AWI  -  Free Report).United Rentals sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1157,PHM,"Sales of previously owned homes increased in October for the second straight month, marking the best performance since June. However, low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), escalated yesterday after the release.October Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales increased 2% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units from 5.37 million in September. However, sales declined 0.9% from the year-ago level, marking the second consecutive year-over-year decline primarily due to shortage of supply. Moreover, the housing industry is yet to recover from the natural disaster that ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.Meanwhile, October’s median sales price grew 5.5% from the comparable period a year ago to $247,000, marking the 68th straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continues to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 3.2% from September and 10.4% from the year-ago period. It would take just 3.9 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. This is also the lowest October reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999.Will the Momentum Continue?The U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes in the South. Again, limited land availability is driving prices higher. Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand.Besides, economists are of the opinion that a tax overhaul could add to the volatility in the market in the coming months. The measure would limit the mortgage-interest deduction on newly purchased homes at $500,000. This is quite a dramatic shift from the current cap of $1 million. The proposed capping of the mortgage-interest deduction could be damaging to pricier coastal markets that have been showing some strength in sales activity in recent times.Despite the above-mentioned woes, new residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October 2017, reinstating strength in the housing industry. Per the latest jointly released report by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, constructions for new homes increased 13.7% in October 2017 to 1.29 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month. This also marks the biggest surge in 12 months as housing starts witnessed big gains in single-family homes and apartments.Again, confidence among homebuilders rose in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second-highest since the recession (July 2005), according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders (""NAHB"") and Wells Fargo.Bottom LineThe latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry’s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and the ongoing recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is adding to the momentum.Moreover, a good industry rank (Top 21% out of more than 256 industries) for homebuilding further supports the growth potential. In fact, in the last three months, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&P 500), as you can see below:Major homebuilders such as KB Home, NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers Inc. are well poised on the bullish fundamentals of the housing market.While, KB Home, NVR and TRI Pointe sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Toll Brothers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1158,PHM,"Prudent land-acquisition strategies, diverse buyer group and solid housing industry fundamentals bode well for PulteGroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report). The company’s last quarterly earnings surged 111% on a year-over-year basis on the back of higher demand, courtesy of favorable U.S. housing market.However, shares of the company have lost 10.9% so far this year. But that’s not a reason to get rid of PulteGroup now. The homebuilding industry has declined 18.7% year to date, thanks to elevated raw material costs and interest rates. Moreover, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry in the past year, rising 23.3%.Let’s delve into other factors which make us reasonably confident about this stock.Land Acquisition Strategy to Boost ProfitabilityPulteGroup’s annual land-acquisition strategies have resulted in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now. In 2017, the company spent $1.1 billion on land acquisition. Considering the healthy housing market fundamentals, PulteGroup expects land-acquisition spend to grow approximately 10% in 2018.The company projects higher returns on invested capital on the back of plans to moderate the rate of land spend, increase the use of possible land options and accelerate inventory turns. The company is also maximizing the value of its land assets by selling houses at higher prices and better margins, thereby using the strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay off debt and systematically return to shareholders. Valuation Looks RationalPulteGroup has a Value Style Score of B, putting it in the top 40% of all the stocks we cover from this perspective. This, combined with a good earnings growth prospects, makes us reasonably confident. Though the company is currently trading at a discount, it has ample opportunities in the near future. In 2018, earnings are expected to grow a solid 51.1%.The company currently has a P/E ratio of 11.8 which is well below the high scaled over the past five years (20.4). This indicates a good entry point. Moreover, the company currently has a forward P/E ratio (price compared with this year’s earnings) of 8.9 suggesting that a more value-oriented path lies ahead of PulteGroup in the near future.Positive Housing Market OutlookOverall fundamentals of the housing market were positive through 2017 and are expected to improve further in 2018. Meanwhile, steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point at strong demand in 2018.Improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and a limited home supply are supporting a consistent rise in home prices, which are expected to boost the top line of homebuilders like PulteGroup, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report). Notably, PulteGroup’s revenues for 2018 are expected to increase 15.4% year over year.Bottom LineUnhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about PulteGroup. Earnings estimates have moved north 6.4% for 2018 and 5.4% for 2019 over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential. The company’s prudent land investments and strategic initiatives should drive the stock in the upcoming quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1160,PHM,"The PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) made its debut on 10/26/2005, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $283.87 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs.

The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factorsn.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.63%.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.20%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.PKB's heaviest allocation is in the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is about 42.20% of the portfolio. Its Industrials and Materials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Lennar Corp (LEN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.25% of total assets, followed by Dr Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report) and Pultegroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 46.3% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -12.46%, and was up about 2.77% in the last one year (as of 04/25/2018). PKB has traded between $28.31 and $36.11 in the past 52-week period.PKB has a beta of 1.20 and standard deviation of 17.94% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index.

1161,PHM,"This week, two sets of housing data for the month of June were released -- existing-home sales data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and new residential sales data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.Existing Home Sales DeclineAccording to the NAR report, existing home-sales dipped 1.8% (from May) in June with only the Midwest witnessing an increase in sales. Median existing-home price for all housing types increased 6.5% from the year-ago period to $263,800 in June, reflecting a new peak and the 64th straight month of year-over-year gains.Low Supply Hitting Existing Home SalesLow supply was the key reason for the decline in existing-home sales. With supply remaining low and price continuing to increase, interested buyers are being forced to remain on the sidelines.Housing inventory declined 0.5% at the end of June and was 7.1% lower than the year-ago period, representing a year-over-year decline for 25 consecutive months.New Home Sales UpMeanwhile, according to the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, new single-family house sales were 610,000 in Jun 2017, up 0.8% from the revised rate of 605,000 in May and 9.1% above the year-ago estimate of 559,000.Existing Home Sales Data a Cause for Concern?Given the decline in existing-home sales, should one avoid investing in this sector? Not really -- according to the NAR report, demand remains strong with affordable listings being picked up immediately. Moreover, despite the market challenges, sales continue to track slightly above last year’s pace.Not just this, promising housing starts data was released earlier this month by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the month of Jun 2017. Privately-owned housing starts grew 8.3% from May 2017 and 2.1% from the year-ago period while single-family housing starts were up 6.3% compared to May. Building permits also increased (up 7.4% from May and 5.1% from Jun 2016) in Jun 2017.Moreover, the home builders industry enjoys a good Zacks industry rank (Top 8% out of 256 industries). The industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) year-to-date (YTD) as well.

1164,PHM,"U.S. retail sales declined for the third straight month in February, as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and other expensive items, indicating a potential drop in GDP in the first quarter. Out of the 13 major sectors, seven reported declines (read: Will Wall Street Hit the Brakes in 2019? ETFs to Play).Retail sales data is going to play along with the market’s expectations of the previously expected three rate hikes in 2018, after muted inflation data reported earlier this week alleviated fears of more aggressive rate hikes by the Fed. Consumer prices increased 2.2% year over year in February, up from 2.1% reported in the previous month.Into the HeadlinesOverall retail sales declined 0.1% in February compared with expectations of a gain of 0.3% after 0.1% drop in the prior month and December. This was the first time since April 2012 that retail sales have declined for three consecutive months. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, core retail sales increased 0.1% in February after staying unchanged in January. Core retail sales are most closely aligned with the consumer spending component of GDP (read: 3 ETFs to Benefit as Faster Rate Hike Worries Cool Down).Consumer spending accounts for over two-thirds of the United States’ GDP and seems to have slowed in 2018. It grew 3.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 but tepid wage growth in February might have dented purchasing power. Average hourly earnings in the United States inched up 0.1% in February compared with 0.3% in the previous month.In February, auto sales declined 0.9%, after a similar drop in January, and receipts at gasoline stations declined 1.2%. However, sales at building material stores increased 1.9% in the month while receipts at clothing stores gained 0.4% and sales at online retailers rose 1.0%.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sectors impacted.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on providing exposure to the global automotive sector.

1165,PHM,"U.S. homebuilding was quite a rage in 2017, giving investors ample scope to rake in handsome gains. The industry is equally attractive this year, courtesy of solid economic growth and job market. Consistent job growth, growing interest from first-time homebuyers as well as high homebuilder confidence are adding to the momentum. Reflecting the positives, total earnings for the construction sector are expected to grow 33.4% in 2018 from the same period last year on 12.6% higher revenues.Meanwhile, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are keeping homebuilders from responding to rising demand to some extent. Despite these challenges, notable homebuilders like PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) have been consistently performing well.Among the industry bellwethers, Lennar and D.R. Horton are the most prominent ones. Despite the companies having strong business lines and solid prospects, Lennar — a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock — appears to be comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) D.R. Horton. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Before drawing a head-to-head comparison between Lennar and D.R. Horton, let’s check out a few key statistics of the companies.What Defines the Housing Giants?D.R. Horton, with a market cap of $18.9 billion, offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi-brand platform. Moreover, the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market.D.R. Horton is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets. In October 2017, the company acquired a 75% stake in Forestar Group, a residential and mixed-use real estate development company, for $558 million. The deal will help D.R. Horton expand operations in Texas — an area which has been witnessing positive housing momentum of late. It is also expected to contribute around $1 billion to D.R. Horton’s annual revenues over the next five years.With a market cap of $14.4 billion, Lennar offers a wide range of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult buyers. While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto, Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.In February, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. for $9.3 billion (including debt) which will create one of the country’s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets.Price PerformanceComing to price performance over the last six months, Lennar has gained 18%, compared with the broader industry’s 13.1%. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton has rallied 20.4% over the period, exceeding both Lennar’s and the broader industry’s performance. Prospects, Estimates Revisions, Earnings HistoryThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies. Analysts expect D.R. Horton to grow earnings at a 10% rate over the next three to five years. Comparatively, Lennar’s earnings are expected to grow 18.3% over the same time frame. Hence, Lennar’s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation.For the near term, the expected current-year earnings growth rate for D.R. Horton stands at 30.7% compared with 38.9% for Lennar.Over the past 30 days, Lennar’s earnings estimates for the current year edged up 0.8% to $5.29 per share. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton’s estimates for the current year have increased 0.3% to $3.58.D.R. Horton’s projected sales growth for the current year is 14.8%, better than Lennar’s average of 12.7%.Hence, Lennar is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectations.Meanwhile, considering a more comprehensive earnings history, D.R. Horton has delivered positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters. However, Lennar has surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters. D.R. Horton has a slightly superior average earnings surprise of 5.8% compared with Lennar’s 4.2%.Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. Return on Capital (ROC) of Lennar is 6.90%, while D.R. Horton has a ROC of 10.5%. The interpretation is that D.R. Horton’s business generates a higher return on investment than Lennar’s.Again, Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for Lennar and D.R. Horton is 12% and 14.8%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored above the industry level of 11.8%, D.R. Horton has an edge here.ValuationBoth the stocks are a little overvalued as is evident from their unfavorable P/E, P/B and P/S ratios compared to the homebuilding industry.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 15.7 and 15.2, respectively, while the industry’s is 14.7. D.R. Horton’s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Lennar.Again, trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) multiple for Lennar is 1.82, compared with 2.09 for D.R. Horton. The industry’s P/B is 1.79.Trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiples for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 1.14 and 1.18, respectively, compared with the industry’s 1.05.Lennar is cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis.VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. Lennar has a beta of 1.31 while D.R. Horton’s beta is 1.20. D.R. Horton’s shares are therefore less volatile than that of Lennar.Bottom LineLennar beats D.R. Horton in terms of earnings growth expectation and valuation, while the latter enjoys an advantage in terms of market cap, revenue expectation and returns.Both the companies remain positive about the overall homebuilding market that will continue to gain on solid demand for homes, favorable job market and strength in economy.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

1167,PHM,"Shares of  TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) have gained 28.1% over the last three months, substantially outperforming the 18.7% growth of its industry. Additionally, this Irvine, CA-based homebuilder, which mainly involves in the design, construction and sale of single-family homes, outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year’s earnings has increased 2.3% in the last 60 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Meanwhile, earnings estimates have also moved north by 5.4% for 2018.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.What Makes TRI Pointe a Solid Pick?Stellar Third-Quarter Performance: Recently, the company came up with robust quarterly results with both top and bottom lines exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 1.2% and 6.7%, respectively. Also, the company’s earnings and revenues improved 118.2% and 23.2%, respectively, driven by 9% growth in home deliveries and 3% rise in average sales price of homes in the quarter.Importantly, the company’s backlog of $1.5 billion at the quarter end increased 56% from $950.2 million a year ago. Its new home orders were also up 36% year over year in the quarter on a 9% increase in average selling communities.TRI Pointe remains well positioned to outperform its peers through better absorptions and deliveries from the higher-margin California market.Solid Estimated EPS Growth: The homebuilder’s current-quarter earnings are expected to increase 77.8% year over year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 16.7%. The company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 40.3%, higher than the industry average of 3.2%.Meanwhile, the company’s EPS growth is expected to increase 12.5% for the current year on 15.8% growth in revenues.In fact, for the company, nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains).Reasonably Valued Stock: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on price-to-book ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.44. This is quite cheap compared with the industry as well as the market at large, as the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 is at 1.93 and 3.64, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning calls for an upside in the quarters ahead.Solid Industry Fundamental: Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose in September, hitting the highest level in nearly 10 years after reporting sales slump in recent months. Per the recently released report by the Commerce Department, new home sales surged 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units in September amid an increase in all four regions. That was the highest level since October 2007 and followed August’s upwardly revised sales pace of 561,000 units.The housing/homebuilding industry has been riding high on steady job and wage growth, historically low mortgage rates and rapidly increasing household formation. The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank (Top 26% out of 256 industries).Consequently, homebuilding companies like TRI Pointe, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and others are expected to gain from such positive industry fundamentals and higher demand.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1173,PHM,"Strong housing demand and lack of competition in the luxury new home market are favoring Toll Brothers Inc (TOL  -  Free Report). Overall fundamentals of the housing market were strong in 2017 and are expected to improve further in the rest of 2018. Steady job and wage growth, recovering economy, moderate home price gains, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory indicate consistent strong demand through 2018.Again, less competition in the luxury new home market is beneficial for Toll Brothers. The company mostly caters to luxury move up buyers, who own a residence and are planning to shift to larger homes. These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. Thus, the company enjoys an edge over other homebuilding companies, resulting in increased home deliveries, earnings and revenue backlog growth.In fiscal 2017, total revenues of $5.82 billion rose 12% and deliveries of 7,151 units increased 17% from the prior-year period. The company delivered double-digit growth in earnings, revenues, contracts and backlog in fiscal 2017. The trend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2018, with the company registering double-digit growth in revenues (up 21%), contracts (up 25% in dollars) and backlog (up 27% in value). This reflects the health of the luxury new home market.Moreover, considering the pent-up housing demand, the company secured some of the most sought-after urban locations in the country, where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to obtain. The company’s solid land position places it well to cater to growing demand in these regions and provide it a competitive edge over peers who are facing land-availability constraints.ConstraintsRising building materials and labor costs are growing concerns for the company’s margin. Land prices are inflating due to limited availability. This can dent homebuilders’ margins in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, the recently imposed tariff on imported steel and aluminum raises concern. An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for home builders, who are already grappling with higher cost, thanks to the recent imposition of lumber tariff.Again, a shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor is exerting pressure on the margins of Toll Brothers and other homebuilders like PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report). In fact, the company’s adjusted gross margin declined 80 basis points in fiscal 2017 and 180 basis points in the last quarter.Notably, shares of the company have lost 5.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.8% rally.Bottom LineUnhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about Toll Brothers. Earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have moved up 3 cents for 2018 and 11 cents for 2019 over the past 60 days. This indicates analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1174,PHM,"Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, sank more than expected in May 2018, marking the second consecutive monthly downfall. It seems that a flourishing economy is giving little boost to the traditional spring homebuying season as supply shortage, higher home prices and rising mortgage rates are somewhat creating hurdles for buyers.Key Takeaways: Tight Supply Continues to UpsetThe National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) said on Wednesday that existing home sales slipped 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million units (5.53 million expected) last month from a downwardly revised 5.45 million in April.Existing home sales decreased 3% on a year-on-year basis in May. This is the third straight month of yearly declines.Regionally, sales were mixed. Sales in the Northeast rose 4.6%, but that was the only region to register an increase. In the Midwest,South and in the West, sales dipped 2.3%, 0.4%, and 0.8%, respectively.Sales grew in the Northeast, which accounts for a small fraction of the market, but it dropped in the West, South and Midwest.Meanwhile, May’s median sales price grew 4.9% from the comparable period a year ago to an all-time high $264,800, marking the 75th straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continued to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 6.1% from the year-ago period. However, housing inventory increased 2.8% from April. It would take just 4.1 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Current Mortgage Rates & ViewsAccording to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage moved higher to their second highest level this year. It rose eight basis points to an average of 4.62% for the week ending Jun 14, 2018, following a decline for two straight weeks.Meanwhile, last week, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year as expected by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Moreover, chances of two more rate hikes this year are high. Hence, mortgage rates are expected to surge further and dilute demand.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed creating hurdles for buyers (mostly first-time). In May, first-time buyers comprised 31% of sales, which is down from both a year ago and prior month level of 33%.That said, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, believes, “Incredibly low supply continues to be the primary impediment to more sales, but there’s no question the combination of higher prices and mortgage rates are pinching the budgets of prospective buyers, and ultimately keeping some from reaching the market.”He further added that a solid U.S. economy accompanied with a healthy labor market should help the housing market reap better gains going forward than what has been seen so far this year.Builder Confidence SlipsThough consumer demand is still robust, we cannot ignore the current headwinds that are restricting the industry. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped in June to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70 as tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are coming in the way of buyers’ affordability, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Tariffs on Canadian lumber are pushing up the already high cost for wood, which are fueling prices higher of up to $9,000 for a new single-family home, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.In addition to the Trump administration's 20% tariff on imported Canadian lumber, imposed in January, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also stirred concerns among investors about the construction sector. According to an Associated Builders and Contractors’ (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May construction material prices increased 2.2% month over month, representing the largest monthly increase in 10 years (since May 2008). On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 8.8%.Our TakeInnumerable problems have been slowing down the homebuilding industry , as evident from the 18.7% year-to-date decline against a 3.7% rise of the S&P 500 Composite. Even big names like Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) have plunged 17.4%, 17.4%, 11.7%, 17.5% and 11.6%, respectively, so far this year.Though homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land/labor costs, they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth. The housing industry is cyclical and affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Although rising interest and mortgage rates, land and labor shortages, and rising material prices raise concerns, the 2018 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market, and a lower tax rate.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1178,PHM,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9, before the opening bell.Recently, the company reduced its fourth-quarter as well as fiscal 2017 forecast due to delays caused by the recent tropical storms. D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, now expects its backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 85% compared with the previously guided range of 88-90%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 83%.SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, is now estimated to be roughly 8.6% (versus 8.3-8.4% projected earlier). This also compares favorably with the year-ago level of 8.8%.Importantly, the company radically trimmed its 2017 forecast for cash flow from operations due to delays caused by the recent catastrophes. D.R. Horton, which primarily sells single-family homes, now anticipates cash flow from operations of about $150 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous forecast of about $300 million.Meanwhile, rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.In fact, D.R. Horton’s gross margin on home sales contracted 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 19.8% in the last reported quarter. Now, storm-related cost pressures are likely to create added pressure in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects housing gross margin to be around 20%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 20.5%.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton remains optimistic and expects post-disaster rebuilding efforts to drive higher demands for new homes next year. Although challenges posed as a result of the recent hurricanes are bound to negatively impact its results to some extent in the fourth quarter, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario.Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, bode well.Homebuilding, comprising about 97.6% of total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $3.94 billion reflect growth of 6.9% sequentially and 7.9% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $97 million indicates an increase of 5.4% from the prior quarter and 7.4% year over year.Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 9.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $4.04 billion, implying 8% year-over-year growth.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | D.R.

1180,PHM,"Two devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — are taking a toll on homebuilders’ forecast for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) has reduced its fourth-quarter as well as fiscal 2017 forecasts due to delays caused by the recent tropical storms.Leading national homebuilder D.R. Horton now expects its backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 85% compared with the previously guided range of 88-90%. SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, is now estimated to be roughly 8.6% compared with 8.3-8.4% projected earlier.Importantly, the company radically trimmed its 2017 forecast for cash flow from operations due to delays caused by the catastrophes of late. D.R. Horton, which mainly sells single-family homes, now anticipates cash flow from operations of about $150 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous forecast of about $300 million.Not only D.R. Horton but another noted homebuilder Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) has also provided views recently regarding fiscal third-quarter deliveries and new orders, post the havoc of hurricanes. The company maintained that the natural disaster is anticipated to cause delays in home deliveries. Sad but true, the destructive hurricanes have affected Lennar’s communities across Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, representing 40% of the company’s annual homebuilding revenues.Per Atlanta-based homebuilder Beazer Homes USA, Inc.’s (BZH  -  Free Report) recent report, the company also expects new home sales and closings to be lower in the quarter ending Sep 30 on a year-over-year basis due to storm-related impacts.The latest U.S. housing data also reflects the ongoing weak sales pace. Existing home sales declined to a one-year low in August, per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB. Existing home sales slipped 1.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. This marks the fourth decline in five months, bringing the annual rate to rock-bottom level in 12 months. Purchases in Houston dropped 25% year over year and sales would have been flat excluding the Harvey effect.Housing starts also came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million last month. This is 0.8% down from a revised July estimate of 1.19 million.Earlier this month, September readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. Economists are of the opinion that ongoing higher labor and material costs have already been hitting the industry hard. Also, inventory shortage has started taking toll on the sales’ pace. Now, scarcity of skilled construction labor is further anticipated to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays.Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain optimistic and expect post-disaster rebuilding efforts to drive higher demands for new homes next year.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1181,PHM,"U.S. housing data continued to tumble in August. Two devastating hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, along with ongoing higher labor and material costs have been hitting the industry hard. Also, inventory shortage has started taking its toll on sales’ pace.August Housing DataExisting home sales declined to a one-year low in August, per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB. Existing-home sales slipped 1.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. This marks the fourth decline in five months, bringing the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months. Purchases in Houston dropped 25% year over year and sales would have been flat excluding Harvey effect.Economists are of the opinion that the diminishing data reflects the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market. This has shot up average home prices nationwide. In fact, median sales price of existing homes rose 5.6% last month from a year earlier. Moreover, total housing inventory declined 6.5% year over year to 1.88 million, marking the 27th consecutive year-over-year decline. That’s just 4.5-month supply. Investors should note that it is more preferable to have about six months of supply for a healthy market.Further adding to the woes, housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million last month. This is 0.8% down from a revised July estimate of 1.19 million. Nevertheless, August construction starts were 1.4% higher year over year. Single-family starts were even stronger, growing 17.1% from a year earlier.Meanwhile, building permit, another economic indicator used to determine the health of the housing sector, increased sharply by 5.7% from the previous month with 1.3 million authorizations. Last month’s permit was also 8.3% above the August 2016 level of 1.2 million. According to Census Bureau data, the areas in Texas and Florida that were devastated by the storms accounted for about 13% of permits issued in the country last year.Investors should note that housing starts, permits and completions dropped 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.2%, respectively, in July. New U.S. single-family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9.4% in July, the lowest level since December 2016.Dipping Housing Data a Drag on Economic Growth in Q3?Earlier this month, September readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. Economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays. The construction sector was already witnessing labor shortage, only to worsen post the hurricanes. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) and others.That said, homebuilders' overall vision of the housing market remains positive. Strong job market, favorable demographics and low mortgage rates that make buying a home very affordable, should act as tailwinds. These positive factors are weighed down by the simple fact that there are just a few homes actually available to buy.The August housing data may have been weak due to Hurricane Harvey or Irma and the sales pace is expected to remain subdued through 2017 in the Houston area as well as in parts of Florida.Nonetheless, re-building efforts and the lost activity are expected to show up in 2018. As the hurricane-ravaged communities rebuild, activity could pick up, giving way to improving demand later this year and into next.Hence, this mixed report suggests that housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1182,PHM,"Shares of Atlanta-based homebuilder Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) have gained 35% over the last three months, substantially outperforming the 4.9% growth of its industry. Additionally, the company outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Beazer Homes expects new home sales and closings to be lower in the quarter ending Sep 30 on a year-over-year basis due to Harvey and Irma-related impact. That said, the company anticipates the impact to be temporary and remains confident about the substantial productivity gains in fiscal 2018. It also continues to expect an improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter from the prior year.We believe higher earnings growth and improving industry conditions are likely to aid the stock in maintaining its solid performance in the quarters ahead.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year’s earnings increased 7.8% in the last 60 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.What Makes Beazer Homes a Solid Pick?Solid Estimated EPS Growth: The homebuilder’s current-quarter earnings are expected to increase 69.7% year over year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 45.4%. The company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 4.5%.Meanwhile, the company’s EPS is expected to decline 19.8% for the current year. Nonetheless, Beazer Homes is expected to show a stellar performance in fiscal 2018 with its bottom line expected to grow 53.5%, comfortably outpacing the industry’s expected 13.5% growth rate.Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company in question.Reasonably Valued Stock: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.91. This is quite cheap compared with the industry as well as the market at large, as the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 is 1.70 and 3.67, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead.Solid Industry Fundamental: The latest July housing data indeed reflects soft housing momentum for the time being. Nevertheless, the 2017 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market. The U.S. economy grew faster-than-anticipated in the second quarter (fastest pace in more than two years) and showed a significant jump from the first quarter’s lackluster 1.2% growth. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate on Aug 30. Along with this, solid homebuilders’ confidence (64 in September) raises optimism about the entire construction sector.The housing/homebuilding industry has been riding high on steady job and wage growth, historically low mortgage rates and rapidly increasing household formation. The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank (Top 22% out of 256 industries).Consequently, homebuilding companies like Beazer Homes, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and others are expected to gain from such positive industry fundamentals and higher demand.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1184,PHM,"EMCOR Group Inc. (EME  -  Free Report) posted its third consecutive earnings beat, as the company’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at a record $1.09 per share, trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents by a whopping 32.9%.The earnings figure also rose an impressive 28.2% year over year, driven by higher productivity and improved margins. Solid non-residential construction demand and strong project execution boosted profits.Inside the HeadlinesThe company generated $1,887 million in revenues for the quarter, which edged down 1.9% year over year, and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,925 million. Till the first quarter of 2017, EMCOR had delivered eight consecutive quarters of record year-over-year revenue growth.Revenues in the quarter were primarily fueled by sound performance from the combined U.S. Construction segments, along with solid contribution from its recent acquisitions.In the quarter under review, the U.S. Construction segment (up about 5.9% year over year) sustained its robust momentum and delivered strong revenues, and operating income growth, driven by the U.S. Mechanical Construction business (up 9.9%). The U.S. Electrical Construction business remained almost flat year over year.The company’s U.S. Building Services segment revenues moved down 5.1% year over year.The U.S. Industrial Services revenues, which were affected by Hurricane Harvey, continued to exhibit a lackluster performance, and contracted 39.1% year over year. The hurricane led to a delay in the fall turnaround work and under absorption of overhead costs for projects which the company was unable to execute on, putting pressure on the segment’s margins.Revenues from total U.S. operations declined 2.7% year over year to $1,800.8 million. Revenue growth from the U.K. building services jumped back to the growth trajectory, and grew 17.6% year over year to $85.9 million, driven by profitable new contracts and solid execution in base business.As of Sep 30, 2017, EMCOR’s backlog was $3.96 billion, up 1.5% year over year with book-to-bill at the highest level in almost two years, supported by a strong domestic market.A rise in the backlog of the U.S. Electrical Construction, U.S. Industrial Services, and U.K. Building Services segments more than offset the dip in backlog for the U.S. Mechanical Construction and U.S. Building Services, resulting in overall growth.From an end-market perspective, the company witnessed growth in backlog for the commercial, institutional, hospitality and healthcare markets, which was somewhat offset by the declines in industrial, water & wastewater and transportation sectors.EMCOR’s operating income came in at a record $106.5 million, up nearly 24% compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by improved profitability and margin expansion in every segment except U.S. Industrial Services, which was affected by Hurricane Harvey. Operating margins came in at 5.6%, reflecting an expansion of 110 basis points over the prior-year period.Liquidity & Cash FlowEMCOR’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $480.5 million as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with $464.6 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Total debt and capital lease obligations were $273.5 million, declining from $283.3 million recorded on Dec 31, 2016.Cash flow used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2017 came in at $238.2 million, significantly higher than $128.9 million recorded in the same period last year.Guidance RaisedEncouraged by its accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U.S. construction space, EMCOR’s management raised its 2017 guidance, with earnings from continuing operations projected in the range of $3.70-$3.80 (up from previous projections of $3.40-$3.60).In light of the current size and mix of its backlog and overall positive market conditions, EMCOR reiterated its revenue guidance for 2017 at $7.6 billion.Our TakeEMCOR has had a decent first half of the year 2017, as the company set fresh records for net income and outdid revenue expectations as well. However, this quarter’s performance was somewhat tepid. Nevertheless, strong performance in the non-residential construction segment has set the tone for robust future growth, as is reflected in the company’s healthy backlog and 2017 guidance.Also, a healthy balance-sheet position and increasing market traction added to the company’s strength, indicating bright future prospects. In addition to this, increasing strength in the U.S. construction markets bode well for the company.

1185,PHM,"Yesterday, at its policy meeting, the Fed went ahead with its highly anticipated move of hiking the interest rates by 25 basis points. While the policy makers were happy about a strong U.S. economy, the rate hike raised eyebrows in the housing market.  Shares of home builders — PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) — tanked 6.67% 4.01%, 4.32%, 4.25%, respectively, following the news release, on concerns that increasing interest rates might ruin the affordability of home buyers in the form of higher interest cost on home mortgages. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Fed Raises Interest RatesAgainst the backdrop of declining employment rates and faster-than-anticipated increase in interest rate beyond the 2% threshold level, the fed funds rate was pulled up for the second time this year.Moreover, the dot plot of the Fed the policy makers hinted at a step up in the pace of rate hike, with two more upward moves for the balance of the year compared with the previous plan of one more. The Fed also sees three rate hikes in 2019.Rising Interest Rate to Impact AffordabilityMortgage rate, which loosely follows the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed.There seems no respite for mortgage rates as the Fed continues with its aggressive policy moves. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.The rise in interest rates looks all the more unwelcoming for the industry, which is already facing higher house demand and constrained supply.  This phenomenon might pinch first-time homebuyers the most.         Consequently, higher mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are trying to make their dream come true of owing a house. Nevertheless, higher interest rates will only act as a dampener in this case.High Input Prices Pose Another ConcernHigh input prices, which include raw material, wages and land cost, have caused an escalation in the end prices of house and at the same time shrink margins of homebuilders.Median price of existing homes was higher for the sixth straight year in 2017. April median sales were up for the 74th consecutive year.This shows continued pain for both hombuilders as well as buyers.Already Soft SalesHome sales have not been really encouraging so far this year, which to a certain extent reflects the struggles of the industry. Per the most recent data for the month of April, sales of new U.S. single-family homes were down in three of the last four reported months.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% sequentially in April, along with a downward revision in sales for three months prior to that.The Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, decreased 1.3% sequentially to 106.4 in April, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline. The index is also down 2.1% year over year.Housing starts and building permits also fell in two of the last four reported months.Year to date, the industry has fallen by 13.5% compared with the 4.3% growth in S&P 500 Composite.Bottom LineNevertheless, a strong U.S. economy and favorable employment picture should offset some of the weakness in the housing industry.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1186,PHM,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) debuted on 10/26/2005, and offers broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $289.70 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. Before fees and expenses, PKB seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index.The index is comprised of stocks of U.S. building and construction companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factorsn.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for PKB are 0.63%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.19%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 43.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Industrials and Materials round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Pultegroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.52% of the fund's total assets, followed by Tractor Supply Co (TSCO  -  Free Report) and Dr Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 45.75% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -10.18%, and was up about 7.33% in the last one year (as of 05/22/2018). PKB has traded between $28.31 and $36.11 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.22 and standard deviation of 17.95% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF has $890.20 M in assets, iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF has $1.57 B. XHB has an expense ratio of 0.35% and ITB charges 0.44%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1187,PHM,"Builder confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April, reinstating builders’ confidence in the current housing market. Importantly, the reading was above the 50 mark, in the first five months of 2018, indicating a favorable outlook. Moreover, this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. Notably, current single-family home sales increased two points in May but the indices measuring buyer traffic and sales expectations in the next six months were unchanged at 51 and 77, respectively.Consumer Demand Boosts Confidence“The solid May report shows that builders are buoyed by growing consumer demand for single-family homes,” said NAHB Chairman Randy Noel. Solid economic growth and low unemployment levels substantiate the growing consumer demand for homes.Although U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter to an annualized pace of 2.3% after averaging higher than 3% in the previous three quarters, the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters as the labor market is near full employment and business as well as consumer confidence is strong. The unemployment rate declined from 4.1% in March to 3.9% in April, the lowest level in nearly 18 years.The positive momentum is expected to continue through 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and a tight supply situation.Higher Raw Material Cost HurtsIncreased lumber prices are denting builders’ earnings growth. In 2017, tariff was imposed on lumber, another major input material in the construction industry. The tariff imposed in retaliation to Canada's restrictions on the import of U.S. dairy products, averaged 20.83% on Canadian lumber imports, which are used mostly for home building in the United States.Builders are concerned about growing labor shortage and limited land availability that are hurting margins of homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report). Also, they are worried about higher aluminum and steel costs, thanks to newly imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel.However, these factors haven’t had a marked impact on the industry's performance, which has been maintaining a lead position for quite some time. The Zacks Homebuilding Industry's rank (top 9% of more than 250 industries) instills investors’ confidence in this industry.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1188,PHM,"Prudent land-acquisition strategies, diverse buyer group together with solid housing industry fundamentals bode well for PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report).Not long ago, this Atlanta, GA-based homebuilder reported impressive first-quarter 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarterly earnings of the company reflect a solid 111% year-over-year jump propelled by higher demand, courtesy of favorable U.S. housing market dynamics backed by an improving economy and job market. Revenues grew 21% on a rise in the number of homes delivered. Revenues from the homebuilding segment increased 21.1% and the same from the Financial Services segment was up 10%. Home closings increased across all operating regions of the company.Shares of PulteGroup have gained 34.2% in the past year compared with its industry rally of 15%. The price performance is backed by the company’s impressive earnings history. PulteGroup surpassed earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, with an average of 10.35%.Also, earnings estimates have moved north 5.7% for the current quarter and 6.4% for 2018 over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential. For 2019 as well, estimates have moved 6% north. The company’s prudent land investments and strategic initiatives should drive the stock in the upcoming quarters. Land Acquisition Strategy to Boost ProfitabilityPulteGroup’s annual land-acquisition strategies have resulted in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now.In 2017, the company was on track with its plan, spending $1.1 billion on land acquisition. Keeping in mind the healthy housing market fundamentals, PulteGroup expects land-acquisition spend to grow approximately 10% in 2018.In the first quarter, the company’s land acquisition spends totaled $290 million, up 20% year over year. Of the land deals approved, approximately 30% of the lots are targeted to serve first-time buyers, with 49% serving move-up clients and 21% targeting active adults.The company expects to realize higher returns on invested capital, given plans to moderate the rate of land spend, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate inventory turns. PulteGroup is also maximizing the value of its land assets by selling houses at higher prices and better margins, thereby using the resulting strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay off debt and systematically return to its shareholders.Diverse Buyer Groups Offer ImmunityPulteGroup’s homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs to all major customer segments: first-time, move-up and active adult. In 2017, 45% of the company’s home closing came from move-up communities, 30% from first-time buyers and 25% from active adults. The company’s sales mix has shifted toward the move-up homebuyer in the recent years, for which demand has been stronger.This shift was mainly due to the financial challenges faced by the first-time homebuyer, despite a broadly recovering U.S. economy, including the overhang of consumer debt, especially student loans related to higher education and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment. Nonetheless, the first-time homebuyer has historically played a major role in new housing and the trend is expected to continue to increase in the coming years.The diverse set of consumer groups will likely shield the company against the fluctuations in demand owing to macroeconomic factors.Additionally, overall fundamentals of the housing market remained positive through 2017 and are expected to improve further in 2018. Meanwhile, steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point toward a strong demand in 2018. Improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and a limited home supply are supporting the continued rise in home prices, thereby boosting homebuilders’ top line.That said, rising land, labor and lumber costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s home sales’ gross margin expanded 40 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 23.6% in the last reported quarter.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and William Lyon Homes (WLH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Century Communities is expected to witness a 38.7% rise in 2018 earnings.KB Home’s earnings are expected to grow 48.5% this quarter.William Lyon’s earnings are expected to grow 43.4% in 2018.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Earnings improved considerably by 65.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 38 cents. The upside can be attributed to higher oriented strand board (OSB) prices and the strong performances in engineered wood products and South American operations.

1190,PHM,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.The homebuilder delivered in-line earnings last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 5.01%.Like other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, point at strong demand in 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has increased more than 41% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 29.9% rally. Let’s See How Things Are Shaping Up for Q1Recently, D.R. Horton updated it guidance for fiscal 2018 tax rate. The company now expects it to be 26%. It will be taking approximately $115 million non-cash charge in Q1 due to a change in the Federal tax code. The company expects 25% tax rate for fiscal 2019.Let’s take a look at the other metrics of the company, i.e. revenues, order growth and gross margin. D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, now expects its backlog conversion rate for the first quarter to be in the range of 83-86%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 82%.The company’s homebuilding revenues increased 11.4% year over year in the preceding quarter. However, for the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues (comprising about 98% of total revenues) of $3,189 million indicates a decrease from $4,067 million in the last quarter and $4,066.5 million in the year-ago period. This downside may be due to the weather issues.Net sales orders increased 18% to 10,333 homes on continued improvement in the preceding quarter. For the upcoming release, the consensus estimate for net sales orders were 10,477 units compared with 9,241 units a year ago. Home closings is estimated to be 10,470 units compared with 13,165 units in the preceding quarter and 9,404 units a year-ago.On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $85 million indicates a decrease from $93 million in the prior quarter and $92.6 million a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $3.28 billion, implying 12.8% year-over-year growth.Now, for the company’s gross margin, D.R. Horton expects home sales gross margin to be around 20%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 19.8% in the preceding quarter, the company’s gross margin on home sales contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.3%. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.For SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, the company expects it to be in the range of 9.5-9.8%. This compares with the year-ago level of 9.5%.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton remains well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario.

1195,PHM,"Leading homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) have been riding high on affordable mortgage interest rates, pent-up demand, employment gains, income growth and favorable industry trends. The home building industry has a solid Zacks Industry Rank (top 14% out of 256 industries). The industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) so far this year as well.Meanwhile, the July existing-home sales were down 1.3% from June owing to low supply and increased prices. Nevertheless, July’s sales pace is 2.1% higher than a year ago. Again, improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and a limited home supply are supporting a continued rise in home prices, thereby boosting homebuilders’ top line.Among the top performers, since D.R. Horton and PulteGroup are in close competition, let us analyze the factors to determine which company is a better investment option in this macroeconomic scenario. Since both the companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we need to delve deeper into factors beyond rank.Price PerformanceD.R. Horton has gained 29.1% so far this year, while PulteGroup’s shares have increased 37.7%. That said, we noticed that both the companies have outperformed the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames, earning a Momentum Score of B. While both the stocks have also outperformed the S&P 500 average so far, PulteGroup clearly scores higher than D.R. Horton.D.R. Horton Vs. IndustryPulteGroup Vs. IndustryEstimate RevisionsPulteGroup’s current year estimate revisions have been discouraging with estimates decreasing from $2.18 a share to $2.09 over the last 60 days.D.R. Horton’s current year figures look quite promising. For fiscal 2017, 12 estimates have moved higher for D.R. Horton while four have gone lower in the past 60 days. The consensus trend has been pretty favorable too, with estimates increasing 1.1% from $2.75 a share to $2.78 over the last 60 days. D.R. Horton expects to perform reasonably well in fiscal 2017 and 2018 on the back of its robust backlog position and well-stocked inventory of land, lots and homes.Earnings GrowthPulteGroup has remarkably beaten earnings estimates in five of the trailing six quarters, recording an average beat of 11.5%. D.R. Horton on the other hand surpassed estimates in four of the last six quarters at an average of 4.7%.PulteGroup makes a better pick in terms of growth investment. Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects.While PulteGroup has a historical EPS growth rate (average trailing 12-month EPS growth rate over the last 3-5 years of actual earnings) of 40.7%, D.R. Horton has registered historical EPS growth of 16.8%. The industry registered historical EPS growth of 28.5%.Coming to current year’s EPS growth, PulteGroup is looking to grow at a rate of 23.8% more than D.R. Horton’s 17.6%.Meanwhile, their industry calls for EPS growth of 17.9%. PulteGroup’s investments in the acquisition of new land positions result in improved volumes, revenues and profitability.Revenue GrowthPulteGroup sales growth in 2017 is projected to be about 15.7% almost on par with D.R. Horton’s projected rate of 16.4%, both more than the industry’s average of about 8%.Apart from prudent capital allocation, PulteGroup is taking actions to improve its operating and financial performance. The initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies. These initiatives have enabled PulteGroup to drive revenues.D.R. Horton is confident about the rest of fiscal 2017, courtesy of 27,600 homes in inventory at the end of June and a robust supply of lots. The company lifted its fiscal 2017 view for total revenues, homes delivered and overall pre-tax profit margin. The company maintains a positive outlook for revenues and profits, both of which are expected to increase double digits, annually.Valuation MetricsGoing by the trailing 12-month Price-to-book (P/B) multiple, both stocks are a tad overvalued, as is evident from their P/B ratios compared with that of the industry’s. P/B ratios for PulteGroup and D.R. Horton are 1.69 and 1.78, respectively, while the industry’s stands at 1.19. PulteGroup’s stock is slightly cheaper than D.R. Horton’s.Land Investment StrategyD.R. Horton invested $2.8 billion in lots, land and development in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared with $2 billion a year ago. The company plans to boost investments to replenish its land and lot supply in 2017 to support revenue growth. It has selectively invested in attractively-priced land and lots in the past two years allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets. D.R. Horton’s well-stocked supply of land, plots and homes provide it with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters, thereby growing sales and home closings.In the second quarter of 2017, PulteGroup invested approximately $236 million in the acquisition of new land positions.  For the first quarter, land investments totaled $566 million, excluding the purchase of John Wieland assets. PulteGroup’s land strategy now emphasizes on investing in shorter-lived smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements when possible, thereby mitigating market risk. It also focuses on investing in land where demand is more sustainable and hence they generate better returns.Final ThoughtsGoing by the above factors, PulteGroup certainly has an edge over D.R. Horton in terms of earnings growth expectations, price performance and valuation. Add, favorable industry trends and a VGM Score of B to this, we believe that we have a good investment proposition in PulteGroup.Other Key PicksApart from PulteGroup, investors interested in the homebuilding industry may also consider NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NVR has an expected earnings growth of 33.9% for the current year. KB Home is expected to witness 51.7% rise in earnings, in fiscal 2017.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

1196,PHM,"Every day a new article pops up about the latest thing that Millennials “killed.” The list ranges from beer and napkins, to running and marriages. This is the way life goes; previous generations typically bemoan the perceived faults of the current as they begin to transform the economics of the day and redefine societal norms.Each generation is different. Millennials might have simply pushed some of life’s bigger responsibilities back a few years, unlike say Baby Boomers or even Generation Y. But for all the stories of ruin and doom, the stock market is chugging along at unprecedented rates and the economy is humming while new technologies transform the world.In fact, in some cases, Millennials themselves have disproportionately created positive, long-lasting economic changes, making investors from older generations a lot richer. And as Millennials begin to age, many will begin to pump even more money into important corners of the economy, and soon enough, the negative focus will shift to the soon-to-be scrutinized Generation Z.With that said, let’s take a look at five stocks that might benefit from the aging Millennial generation.1.      PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report)This multi-brand homebuilding company is set to grow in the coming years, especially as more Millennials begin to buy homes. PulteGroup is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 20.51% over the next three to five years. On top of the long-term earnings growth projections, the homebuilding firm currently presents outstanding value and is trading at just 11.37x earnings. PulteGroup has also been able to build a growing cash supply and has seen its stock price climb nearly 80% over the last 52-weeks. PHM is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).2.       Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report)This upscale home furnishing power has been able to get ahead of new experiential retail trends and even expanded into the restaurant business, which helped its stock price skyrocket 216% over the last year. The company’s new operations have resonated with Millennials—who are now at the right age to be buying home goods. Restoration Hardware is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Furthermore, the company is expected to see its bottom-line expand for years to come as its earnings per share figures are projected to expand at an annualized rate of 20% over the next three to five years.3.       Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)  Millennials are nearly solely responsible for Facebook’s meteoritic rise to one of the most valuable companies in the world—as they were the founders and the first wave of users. Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and the company’s 109.17% cash flow growth rate should help it further invest in new technologies such as AI and augmented reality. Millennials are unlikely to ditch Facebook’s platform in the coming years, and the company is still actively growing its user base. The social media giant is also expected to see its bottom-line surge at an annualized rate of 26.82% over the next three to five years.4.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) For all of the businesses that Millennials have supposedly harmed, they have definitely helped lift Amazon’s e-commerce division. Amazon has been able to secure a growing cash reserve and is only set to expand its sales as the need for cloud computing and web hosting increases. Meanwhile, Millennials are using the site to buy everything, including groceries—plus, they already love Whole Foods. Looking down the road, the company is expected to see its EPS figures grow at an annualized rate of 20.87% over the next three to five years. Jeff Bezos’ company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5.       Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report)This Miami-based home construction company has seen its stock price climb 59.62% over the last 52 weeks. Some might think this is a result of short-term demand, but we’re likely just seeing that start of the Millennial home buying boom. On top of strong 2018 top- and bottom-line growth projections, Lennar’s EPS figures are expected to expand at an annualized rate of nearly13% over the next three to five years.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1197,PHM,"The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped slightly in the first month of 2018 after reaching an 18-year high in December 2017, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index. Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period, given the changes to the tax code that will likely promote the small business sector and boost broader economic growth.The January 2018 reading was down two points to 72 from the December level of 74. Notably, all three Housing Market Index (HMI) components slipped meagerly in January. Current sales conditions decreased one point to 79. Buyer traffic decreased four points to 54 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped one point to 78.Importantly, the HMI gauge of future sales expectations remained in the 70s, signaling that housing demand should continue to grow this year.In the words of NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, Louisiana, “Our members are excited about the year ahead, even as they continue to face building-material price increases and shortages of labor and lots.”The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.After the solid 3.1% economic growth in the in the July-September quarter, the world’s largest economy is expected to have advanced 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the latest Atlanta Fed’s real-time Q4 GDP growth estimate. This solid upbeat projection holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate (4.1% in December 2017).Disruptions caused by the hurricanes and other natural disasters seemed to have short lived as revealed from recent economic data reports.However, challenges like inventory shortage are still prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country, thereby affecting affordability. Again, higher construction costs along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the companies’ margins. Meanwhile, the recent tax-cut legislation that limited deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes is also expected to hurt sales to quite an extent.Homebuilding Industry PerformanceIn the last six months, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&P 500), as you can see below. Again, investing in the industry might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 7% (19 out of 256 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Major homebuilders such as Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), CalAtlantic Group, Inc. , M/I Homes, Inc. (MHO  -  Free Report), NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) and TRI Pointe Group, Inc.

1202,PHM,"The housing market has been going strong lately, courtesy of steady job growth and gradual economic recovery. One such company cashing in on the favorable backdrop is PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report). PulteGroup’s shares have gained 37.4% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 29.6% rally. Also, the company has outperformed the industry in all the other time frames we considered — 12-week and 52-week.Moreover, earnings estimates have moved north in the last few weeks reflecting investors’ optimism on PulteGroup. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings increased 3.6%. This bullish analysts’ sentiment justifies the company’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting it to outperform in the near term.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Notably, this homebuilder shows strengths in several key areas.What Makes PulteGroup a Solid Pick?Prudent Land Strategy: PulteGroup’s annual land acquisition expenditure doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenues in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenues in 2015. These investments have resulted in improved volumes, revenues and profitability in 2016, a trend that is likely to continue over the next few years. In the first nine months of 2017, the company spent $773 million in land acquisition. It had projected to spend approximately $1.1 billion on land acquisition and $1.6 billion on land development (up around 10%) in 2017.The company expects to realize higher returns on invested capital, given it plans of moderating the rate of land spend, increase the use of land options where possible, and accelerate inventory turns.Impressive Expected Earnings & Revenue Growth: Apart from prudent land investments, the company has been taking initiatives to improve its operating and financial performance. These initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies. These initiatives have helped in driving profits. Earnings in the last reported quarter increased a solid 40% from the year-ago level. The upside was supported by higher demand despite disruptions caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma.The homebuilder’s earnings for 2018 are expected to increase 42.5% year over year, thereby making it a great pick in terms of growth investment. The company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 20%.The company also has a three-five year expected EPS growth rate of 17.1%.Higher Return on Equity: PulteGroup’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. ROE in the trailing 12 months has been 14.4%, while the industry has gained 10.8%, reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Solid VGM Score: PulteGroup has a VGM Score of A. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) make solid investment choices.Solid Industry Fundamental: The housing/homebuilding industry has been riding high on steady job and wage growth, historically low mortgage rates and rapidly increasing household formation. The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank (Top 27% out of 256 industries).New and existing home sales got a major boost in November 2017, suggesting that the market is regaining momentum after hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily stalled activity. A strong job market and solid U.S. economy have ensured consistent gains for homebuilding stocks.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other stocks in the Zacks Construction sector that includes Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1, and Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (CPAC  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2.Full-year 2018 earnings for Century Communities is likely to rise 72.4%, while that of Cementos Pacasmayo are expected to increase 41.9%.NVR is expected to witness 16.8% growth in 2018 earnings.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1205,PHM,"Vulcan Materials (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.8%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average earnings beat being 10.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Adverse weather conditions in many markets might mar Vulcan’s results in the to-be-reported quarter, thanks to shipment delays. Vulcan Materials is susceptible to bad weather conditions as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects the company’s ability to produce and distribute products. It also has a negative impact on demand as construction work can be hampered by weather. The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are prevalent during these periods.Weak Top-Line GrowthThough adverse weather conditions is expected to mar growth  prospects in the quarter, Vulcan’s various bolt-on acquisitions can be expected to provide some cushion to revenues. Moreover, improvement in private construction activities, especially private residential construction, bodes well. As a result, demand for Vulcan Materials’ products is likely to rise, which will drive revenues.Coming to the segments, Aggregates segment sales (accounting for more than 78% of total revenues) will fall 1.5% in the quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nevertheless, in the first quarter, revenues are expected to grow 26% year over year in the asphalt segment, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Concrete segment revenues are projected to rise 10% in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, Calcium segment revenues are likely to be up 5.8% in the to-be-reported quarter.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $798.6 million, up  1.4% year over year.Earnings to DeclineIncreased cost that includes freight distribution costs, rise in the unit cost of diesel fuel and storm-related costs is anticipated to hurt margins. The tepid sales growth along with increased costs is likely to dent earnings. Earnings are estimated at 22 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 34.3%.Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteQuantitative Model PredictionPer our proven model, Vulcan Materials will not beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter.

1206,PHM,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before markets open. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.4%.However, Martin Marietta has a dismal history, at least in terms of bottom-line performance. The company surpassed expectations in only three of the last 10 quarters. Well, the obvious question that arises is whether Martin Marietta will be able to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported.Let us delve into the factors that are likely to affect Martin Marietta’s first-quarter 2018 earnings.Adverse weather conditions in many markets might mar Martin Marietta’s results in the to-be-reported quarter. Weather-related risks have been affecting the company’s performance, thanks to the exterior nature of the business, in spite of improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency.  The first and fourth quarters are most affected by winter. Hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are prevalent during these periods.Nevertheless, string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private construction activity are expected to provide some cushion to revenues and earnings. Sustained growth in construction activity drives demand for aggregates and cement businesses. This can be expected to boost results to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the first quarter, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is 41 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 38.8%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $805.1 million, indicating a rise of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Martin Marietta is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Martin Marietta has an Earnings ESP of -13.04% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1210,PHM,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the homebuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.31%. The company surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 5.83%.Like other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point toward strong demand in 2018.Resultantly, shares of D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, have increased more than 32% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 17.9% rally.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R.

QuoteLet’s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementWith an impressive sales backlog, along with a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, D.R. Horton is well positioned for 2018. The company expects its backlog conversion rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 97-100%.The company’s homebuilding revenues increased 14% year over year in the preceding quarter. For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues (comprising about 98% of total revenues) of $3,695 million indicates an increase from $3,252 million in the last quarter and $3,164 million in the year-ago period.Net sales orders increased 16% to 10,753 homes on continued improvement in the preceding quarter. For the upcoming release, the consensus estimate for net sales orders of 15,779 units reflects an increase from 13,991 units a year ago and 10,753 units in the prior quarter.Last quarter, home closings increased 15% to 10,788 homes, while growing 14% to $3.2 billion in value. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, home closings are estimated to be 12,089 units compared with 10,685 units a year ago.On the other hand, the consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $93 million indicates an increase from $81 million in the prior quarter and $87 million a year ago.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $3.75 billion, implying 15.3% year-over-year growth.Apart from solid revenues, D.R. Horton expects home sales gross margin to be around 20-21%, compared with 19.8% in the year-ago quarter. In the preceding quarter, the company’s gross margin on home sales expanded 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.8%. The upside was driven by lower warranty, litigation and interest costs as a percentage of homebuilding revenues.However, investors should note that the company’s home sales gross margin decreased 20 bps to 20% in fiscal 2017. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc.

(TOL  -  Free Report) among others.Meanwhile, for SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, the company expects it to be in the range of 9-9.2%.

1215,PHM,"As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Instead, it shifted its focus to unwinding its massive balance sheet which currently amounts to $4.5 trillion. The central bank indicated that the process of offloading the bond holdings it had built up in the years immediately after the Great Recession will begin in September.Such a move also amounts to monetary tightening of another kind. But markets have chosen to focus on the Fed’s move to recognize that inflation has remained low, belying its earlier expectations. This development has given rise to speculation that another rate hike may not occur this year after all. Given such a scenario, investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option.Focus Shifts to Balance Sheet TrimWith the Fed staying away from a rate hike at the end of its meeting, the spotlight is now squarely on the unwinding of the central bank’s massive balance sheet. The language of the Fed’s statement indicates that it will begin this process around September.The massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet consists of Treasury securities worth around $2.46 trillion and $1.77 trillion of mortgage backed securities. Most of these securities were accumulated as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the years following the recession of 2008.Initially, the Fed plans to offload securities worth $10 billion a month which will increase within a quarter to $50 billion. Even after this cycle is completed, Fed officials project that the balance sheet will still be larger than $2 trillion. The Fed Chair and other key officials have repeatedly indicated that this process should not disrupt market activity. However, concerns that poor demand for such bonds could result in an increase in rates continue to linger.Inflation Concerns Take Center StageBut such concerns have been overshadowed by the Fed’s change in stance on inflation. The central bank’s statement dropped the word “somewhat” from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continues to remain under 2%. This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative perception about one of the Fed’s key objectives.Data released earlier has already raised such concerns on several occasions. Currently, average hourly wage growth refuses to rise above 2.5%. Meanwhile, the Price Consumption Expenditures index or PCE, also referred to as the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, remains at 1.4%. What is noteworthy is that the labor market continues to improve, and unemployment has declined to 4.4%.This is why investors have rightly chosen to focus on the Fed’s change in tone on inflation. There is a growing feeling that the Fed will not raise its rates in the near future. Following the release of the policy statement, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool declined from 52% to 50%. This means that markets now believe that the likelihood of the Fed raising rates after its December meeting has declined. Our ChoicesThe Fed’s acknowledgement that inflation has failed to rise to its targeted levels has captured the attention of market watchers. Investors now believe that such concerns will hinder the Fed’s central bank’s attempts to raise rates in the near future.This is why investing in stocks from the utilities, telecom and real estate sectors looks prudent at this time. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in.

1216,PHM,"Homebuilding companies, under the broader construction sector, seem to be on solid ground. Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the homebuilding industry’s performance in 2017.However, the U.S. housing data has been weak in July/August as inventory shortage has started taking its toll on sales pace and has pushed average home prices higher nationwide. Again, apart from inventory shortage woes and higher land/labor costs, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to have a negative impact to some extent on the companies’ results. That said, the companies anticipate the impact to be temporary and remain confident about the substantial productivity gains in the later part of 2017 and through 2018.Per our latest Earnings Preview, earnings for the total S&P 500 companies are expected to grow 2.6% from the year-ago period, while revenues will increase 5%. The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, nine are expected to witness an earnings decline.Nonetheless, overall, earnings growth for the quarter is on track to mark growth and construction seems to be one of the stand-out sectors. The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 8.9% in Q3 compared with 15.5% in the prior quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 10.6% (8.8% growth in Q2).Let us take a look at how the following construction companies are placed ahead of their quarterly release on Oct 24.Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, 2017 before the opening bell.The company managed to surpass/meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.15%.Masco’s growth in the last few quarters has mostly been driven by steadily growing repair and remodel activity. The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Notably, over 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. In the third quarter, the company expects KraftMaid, Masco’s leading repair and remodel brand, to capitalize on its already strong performance with new product launches.Masco’s Plumbing Products segment, comprising about 46% of the total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to overall revenue growth in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $953 million reflect a growth of 6% from the year-ago quarter.The Cabinets segment is expected to return to positive growth trajectory from this quarter, after experiencing year-over-year sales decline for quite some time now. The consensus estimate for segment revenues of $250 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.6%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 5.8% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter owing to strong pro-paint growth, while the Windows and Other Specialty Products is expected to decline 2.5% in the to-be-reported quarter.Thus, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.96 billion, implying 4.3% growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 53 cents, reflecting a 29% year-over-year increase.Our proven model hints at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Masco has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).,This combination increases the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.(Read more: Repair/Remodel Activity to Drive Masco's Q3 Earnings)Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Masco Corporation QuotePulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens.PulteGroup is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Homebuilding, comprising about 97.5% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.3 billion reflect a growth of 17.6% sequentially and 22.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $54 million indicates an increase of 14.2% from the prior quarter and 12.5% year over year.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying 19.8% growth. The solid improvement in the top line is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 59 cents, reflecting a 37.2% year-over-year increase.Meanwhile, PulteGroup does not have the right combination of two main ingredients for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and the Earnings ESP for PulteGroup is -6.22%.(Read more: Can Higher Home Sales Drive PulteGroup Q3 Earnings?)PulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  PulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteThe Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens.Recently, the company lowered its profit outlook for the third quarter to reflect the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on its operations in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and neighboring areas as well as disruptions from two earthquakes in Mexico.Considering the impacts of hurricanes and earthquakes, Sherwin-Williams now expects its core net sales to rise by a low-single digit clip year over year in the third quarter compared with its earlier view of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.The company now expects earnings for the third quarter to be in the range of $3.40-$3.70 per share, down from its earlier view of $3.70-$4.10. The revised outlook includes 10 cents per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.Thus, total revenues are expected to improve 33.8% from the prior-year quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $4.70 per share reflects a 11% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Sherwin-Williams is unlikely to beat earnings estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1217,PHM,"(0:30) - Small Cap Growth vs. Value Stocks(3:00) - Zacks Stock Screen: Value Stocks With Growth(5:30) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(14:45) - Takeaways From Using The PEG Ratio(17:25) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #72 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.As the year winds down, it’s clear that one area of winners in 2017 on Wall Street have been the growth stocks. That extends even to small cap growth which has dominated the small cap universe.Value, while it is up on the year, hasn’t performed as well as the other investing styles.Heading into 2018, it’s unclear whether value will see a rebound or if growth will take the crown again. Why not plan on both scenarios?Finding Value Stocks Using a Basic ScreenOne-way value investors can hedge their bets is by buying value stocks that also have growth. This is a very powerful combination, if you can find it.Tracey decided to run a screen using just a few metrics to see out the growth component along with value.She started with the Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). By including the Holds that widened the screen as most stocks are found in that category.Then she combined it with a PEG ratio under 1.0. A PEG under one usually indicates that a company is undervalued but that it also has growth. It’s cheap growth.And that’s it. Just those two metrics.Because she started with a wide screen, she got 148 stocks.Here are some of the stocks that caught her eye in some of the industries everyone will be watching in 2018.5 Stocks with PEGs Under 1.01.      Diamondback Energy (FANG  -  Free Report) has a PEG of just 0.8. The energy sector was ignored by Wall Street in 2017 even though the earnings outlook is much improved over 2016. Will these stocks see big gains in 2018?2.     KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) is still cheap even though shares have soared in 2017. It has a PEG of 0.7 and is expected to grow earnings another 23% in 2018.3.     Pulte (PHM  -  Free Report) is another large homebuilder that no one is talking about. Who cares about the homebuilders when you can buy Nvidia, right? But Pulte is also cheap. It has a PEG ratio of 0.9 and is expected to grow earnings by 37% in 2018. Is it too late to get in?4.     Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report) is still producing double digit earnings growth as consumers want “experiences” and travel fits right into that. This cruise company has a PEG of 0.8. Earnings are expected to jump another 15.4% next year.5.     Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) is one of 9 retailers that came up in the screen. It has bounced off its recent lows, when it was trading with a P/E of around 5.0. It now has a P/E of 7.6 and a PEG of 0.9. But will earnings rebound next year as well?Investors should also take a look at some of the smaller, specialty retailers like The Tile Shop (TTS). It has a PEG of 0.8.Remember, to always research the companies before you buy. This was a basic screen with few metrics. It doesn’t tell you the whole picture.Additionally, the semiconductors were well-represented in the screen, as they have big growth projections and are cheap.Tracey covered this group in a recent podcast called The Semiconductors: Value Stocks or a Trap?Where else can you find value stocks with growth heading into 2018?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1218,PHM,"Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 5, before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.8% in the trailing four quarters.Lack of competition in the luxury new home market proves beneficial for Toll Brothers. The company mostly caters to luxury move up buyers, who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger homes. These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. Thus, Toll Brothers enjoys an edge over other homebuilding companies, resulting in strong earnings, revenues, contracts and backlog growth.Notably, the third quarter of fiscal 2017 marked the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in contract units and value, with 20% or higher growth in each of the last four quarters. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter contract value is pegged at $1.7 billion, reflecting an increase of 13.3% year over year.Also, home deliveries are expected to peak in the fourth quarter and continue into 2018. The company expects home deliveries between 2,275 and 2,575 units in the quarter, higher than 2,224 units in the prior-year quarter.The company expects average price of home deliveries in the $840,000 to $860,000 range, reflecting an increase of 6.3-8.9% year over year. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter is expected to improve 35-50 bps year over year in the quarter, while SG&A expenses are estimated at 8% of revenues compared with 8.7% of revenues in the prior year quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.19, reflecting an increase of 77.6% year over year. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.08 billion, reflecting an increase of 12.2% year over year.Also, the outlook for the U.S. homebuilding industry is quite compelling, given the affordable interest rates and tight inventory indicating pent-up demand. Moreover, the latest positive housing data reassures the housing industry’s strength, courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is driving the momentum.Meanwhile, rising building materials and labor costs raise concern.Our quantitative model shows that Toll Brothers has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to post an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Toll Brothers is +4.20%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks Rank: Toll Brothers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Toll Brothers Inc.

1219,PHM,"Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped for the second straight month in January and in four of the past six months. Does this give smoke signals of a downtrend in the housing market?Exchange-traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry dropped on Monday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) fell 0.7% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) dropped 1%. Meanwhile, the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) was down 1.3%.Shares of major builders of the U.S. housing industry like D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) slipped following the news release on that day.Is Weather or Higher Mortgage Rates the Culprit?Sales of newly constructed homes, accounting of roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, fell 7.8% in January from the prior month and 1% from the year-ago period to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units, as per data released on Feb 26 by the Commerce Department.Notably, last month’s figure is the lowest since August 2017, weighed down by sharp declines in the Northeast and South. Sales sank 33.3% in the Northeast and fell 14.2% in the South, which accounts for the majority of new home sales. Sales rose 1% in the West and 15.4% in the Midwest.The downside was probably due to cold weather, particularly in Southern states, rather than any economic factor. Otherwise, all regions would have experienced deterioration.Again, higher mortgage rates could also be the reason for this downfall. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion with U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.15% for the week ending Jan 25, 2018, the highest level since March 2017, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.Again, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.40% for the week ending Feb 22, the highest level since April 2014, from 4.38% in the prior week. It has increased for seven straight weeks. Higher mortgage rates accompanied with the loss of homeowner tax breaks in certain expensive markets might be hitting on affordability.Apart from the recent weak new home sales report, last week’s report from the National Association of Realtors also showed dismal existing home sales. Existing home sales dropped 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month. Existing home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, tanked 4.8% on a year-on-year basis in January.Meanwhile, the industry has already been challenged by shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. Total housing inventory at the end of January rose 4.1% to 1.52 million existing homes available for sale, but is still 9.5% lower than a year ago and has fallen year over year for 32 consecutive months. That said, the inventory of new homes was up 15% from a year ago in January, which is expected to provide some relief as we head toward the spring selling season.Limited land availability is driving prices higher, as median sales price of a new home jumped 2.4% year over year last month. The median house price increased 5.8% for existing homes from a year ago and was the 71st consecutive month of year-on-year price gain.Adding to the woes, first-time buyers comprised 29% of sales in January, which is down from 32% in December 2017 and 33% a year ago.Will the Current Downfall Linger Through 2018?Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period. In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid job market is keeping the industry alive. Americans filing for unemployment benefits plunged to a 45-year low for the week ending Feb 17, 2018, indicating strong job growth. Job additions grew at a solid pace in January, and the record low unemployment rate and strong wage growth show that the labor market is in good shape. Notably, wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Although home price increases have surpassed wage growth, which remained 2.9%, the optimism surrounding the U.S. housing market remains intact amid overall economic growth. Along with this, a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and demand.Given this mixed scenario, we should keep an eye on how the housing sector responds to rising rates as we approach in Spring, which according to Fitch Ratings, is traditionally more upbeat than the rest of the year.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1220,PHM,"U.S. retail sales picked up in March after declining for three straight months, as consumers bought more motor vehicles and other expensive items, reflecting a revival in consumer spending owing to tax cuts and refunds. Eight of 13 major retail categories showed improvement.Into the HeadlinesOverall retail sales increased 0.6% in March, after 0.1% drop in each of the previous three months. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, core retail sales ticked up 0.4% in March after remaining unchanged in February. Core retail sales are most closely aligned with the consumer spending component of GDP (read: 3 ETFs to Better Prepare for Aggressive Rate Hikes).Consumer spending accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. GDP, which seems to have slowed in 2018. It grew 4.0% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 but tepid wage growth in February might have dented purchasing power. However, given the recent positive numbers, analysts believe the U.S. economy is entering the second quarter with great momentum, after a harsh winter marred purchasing power for big-ticket items at the beginning of 2018.In March, auto sales rose 2.0% after a 1.3% drop in February. Moreover, sales at furniture stores increased 0.7% while electronics and appliances stores witnessed an increase of 0.5%. However, sales at building material stores declined 0.6% in the month while receipts at clothing stores fell 0.8%. Moreover, gas station sales dropped 0.3% in the month, the steepest since July.Let us now discuss a broad ETF providing exposure to the retail space.SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. retail industry that looks to benefit from improved consumer sentiment.

1221,PHM,"The Q1 earnings season is gathering steam and investors are eagerly awaiting results from major homebuilders, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons. The quarter witnessed massive volatility on uncertainty over the number of interest rate hikes and inconsistent monthly homebuilding data.Evidently, the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index has dropped 8.8% year to date. Again, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has declined 1% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the broader market’s (S&P 500) return of 3.8%.Indeed, the U.S. stock market seems to have taken a brief hiatus. That said, positive momentum at the start of the first-quarter reporting cycle remains intact for the industry given the solid earnings outlook and favorable economic fundamentals.Homebuilding at a GlanceSales of previously-owned homes jumped in February, marking the first gain in the last three months. This shows that an increasing number of Americans are looking to buy homes despite rising prices and limited availability.As revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales ticked up 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. Sales increased 1.1% from the year-ago level. The surge in existing-home sales (accounting for 90% of the market), after the slump in the last two months, indicates that competition is expected to heat up in the traditional spring home-buying season.Meanwhile, new home sales increased 0.5% year over year in February but dropped 0.6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 622,000 units. Building permits, though down 5.7% month over month, rose 6.5% year over year in February.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed a bottleneck for buyers (mostly first-time). Apart from concerns over possibilities of a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to grapple with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are keeping homebuilders from responding to growing demand.That said, the homebuilders’ confidence reading for March was a solid 70 buoyed by growing demand. In spite of inventory shortage, robust demand from a solid economy and a cheerful job market are making the industry go strong. With the strong economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.Solid Q1 Earnings ExpectationsMajority of the Zacks broad sectors (14 out of 16) are expected to be in the positive territory in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, homebuilding companies are broadly grouped in the Construction sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and companies seem to be on solid ground.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, construction sector earnings are expected to increase 35.4% in the first quarter compared with 20.6% in the preceding quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 15.8% (13.3% growth in Q4), while margins are likely to grow 1% (0.4% in Q4).In spite of the inventory woes and higher costs, it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of housing stocks that are poised to beat earnings this quarter. An earnings beat would also pave the way for stock price appreciation.Notable Q1 Releases So FarA close look at the recently-released numbers of the nation’s homebuilding bigwigs unveils an encouraging picture. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) came up with stellar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on solid fundamentals. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3% and surged 116.7% from the year-ago quarter. Though revenues missed the consensus mark, it increased 6% year over year, driven by higher housing revenues.Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings and sales on solid demand. Notably, the company completed the CalAtlantic buyout in February. Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar, said, ""Our first quarter results begin to display the true power of this combination.  Although these results do not include 2 ½ months of CalAtlantic's operations, all company metrics have performed as expected or better and we have grown more confident in our ability to exceed our $100 million synergy target in 2018 and we are on track to meet our $365 million synergy target in 2019.""Which Are the Right Picks?Picking the right stocks could be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the housing space. One way to do it is by choosing stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Winning StocksFor investors ready to try out this strategy, we have highlighted four homebuilding stocks that may stand out this season.Our first choice is PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report). The company primarily engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses in the United States. This leading national homebuilder topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.51%. It also seems to be poised to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +4.55%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.PulteGroup is scheduled to report first-quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens.We have chosen Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH  -  Free Report) that designs and builds single-family homes in the United States. The company topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 20.22%. It looks poised to beat expectations in the first quarter as well. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +31%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 74 cents.Meritage Homes is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Apr 25, after the closing bell.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), a leading Texas-based national homebuilder, makes another attractive pick. The company has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.83%. The company is poised to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter as well.

Horton is scheduled to report second-quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, before market opens.The fourth option is a Denver, CO-based homebuilder M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) that engages in homebuilding and financial service businesses in the United States. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.23%. Nonetheless, the company has surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 29.24%.For the upcoming release, M.D.C. Holdings has a Zacks Rank #3 along with an Earnings ESP +1.89%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings is 53 cents.M.D.C. Holdings will likely announce first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.Bottom LineTaking the recovering economy and solid job market into consideration, one should ideally snap up housing stocks before they release their earnings numbers.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

1222,PHM,"NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19. Last quarter, the company’s earnings fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.3%. Meanwhile, the company surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with the average being 11.03%.In fact, shares of NVR, one of the leading homebuilding companies, have gained 3.5% in the last six months, comparing favorably with the industry’s 1% decline.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.Total revenues (Homebuilding & Mortgage Banking fees) totaled $6.3 billion in 2017, up 8.3% year over year. Homebuilding revenues increased 8%, primarily on 6.9% year-over-year increase in the number of settled units. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, evident from the company’s solid backlog. As of Dec 31, 2017, backlog of homes increased on a unit basis by 24% and dollar basis by 21% to $3.3 billion.  Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.51 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 21.4%. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for homebuilding revenues is $1.4 billion, indicating an increase from $1.2 billion a year ago but a decrease from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter.Moreover, the company focuses on its disciplined business model, based on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Unlike other homebuilders, NVR’s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry. The cash generated is thus used to expand business while returning excess capital to shareholders through buy-back programs.Again, with a modest rise in pricing and moderated construction costs, NVR was able to witness gross margin expansion of 150 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter and 170 bps in full-year 2017. The trend is expected to be maintained in the quarter to be reported as well.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $31.44 per share, reflecting a 25.2% year-over-year increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NVR is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to surpass estimates.For NVR, however, this is not the case as listed below —Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.NVR, Inc.

1223,PHM,"PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%. It surpassed estimates in all of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 4.5%.Let us take a look at the factors that are likely to influence the company’s Q1 results.Prudent Land InvestmentsPulteGroup’s annual land acquisition strategies resulted in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now. Its land strategy emphasizes on investing in shorter-lived and smaller land assets, thereby mitigating market risks. Consistent with its efforts to improve overall asset efficiency and reduce land risks by optioning lots, the company has successfully reduced owned land to just 4.2 years in 2017, down from 5.6 years a year ago. At the same time, it increased lots controlled under option to 37%.Apart from prudent capital allocation, PulteGroup is taking actions to improve the operating and financial performance. These initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies, which are expected to continue driving meaningful profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Healthy Housing Momentum to Boost RevenuesHealthy buyer demand along with good traffic points toward strong fourth-quarter revenues for the company. Homebuilders, like PulteGroup, have been doing well lately, courtesy of steady job and wage growth, recovering economy, historically low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory.Homebuilding revenues increased 11.9% in 2017, comprising of Home sale and Land sale revenues, both of which increased 11.7% and 58.3%, respectively. Given the strong demand, the trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.8 billion for Homebuilding revenues reflects growth of 10.5% from the year-ago quarter. Home sale revenues reflect growth of 12.8% year over year, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Land sale revenues will likely increase $12.4 million from the prior-year quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimates for Financial Services revenues of $44.4 million reflect a year-over-year increase of 6.3%.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.84 billion, implying 13.2% growth.Rising Costs Hurt MarginsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins by limiting homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortages are leading to higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability, thus, denting homebuilders’ margins to some extent. Home sale’s gross margin decreased 140 basis points in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, given the higher revenue expectation, the bottom-line is expected to increase significantly. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stand at 44 cents, reflecting a 41.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that PulteGroup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.PulteGroup has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #3, which makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1224,PHM,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results (ending Feb 28) before market open on Apr 4.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14%. This Miami-based homebuilder, however, surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 4.2%.Notably, Lennar’s diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers, and positive housing market fundamentals are favorable for this leading homebuilder in the United States.Factors at PlayThe company has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to the strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s Homebuilding segment revenues (comprising almost 88.6% of total revenues) of $2.3 billion are likely to increase from $2 billion in the year-ago period but decrease from $3.4 billion reported in the prior quarter. This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog. The company expects a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 65-70% for the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s order trend (in units) also remained solid, growing 12% in the last reported quarter and 11% in fiscal 2017.The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovating new products such as recently announced creative student-loan program. However, the segment is likely to register a significant decline in refinanced volume that impacted 2017. This will likely continue to impact the first half of fiscal 2018. Because of this headwind, first quarter and second quarter are expected to result in lower year-over-year earnings. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $161 million reflects 19.1% sequential decline. However, it is expected to grow from $148 million recorded in the year-ago period.While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.On the flip side, Lennar, like other renowned homebuilding companies, has been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. While labor shortages are leading to higher wages, land prices are increasing due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points (bps) year over year in both the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, Lennar’s diligent efforts to improve its operating efficiency via digital marketing efforts, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder. In this regard, the company is working hard to improve its SG&A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted to 9.2% in the fiscal 2017 from 9.4% in the year-ago period, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting an increase of 39% year over year. Meanwhile, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.65 billion, implying 13.5% increase.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Lennar does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Lennar has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Lennar carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the Zacks Construction sector that according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.PulteGroup, Inc.

1226,PHM,"Homebuilding company PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, PulteGroup delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71%. The company also surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.59%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayPulteGroup is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Homebuilders have been doing well courtesy of steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation, and a limited supply of inventory. All these positive trends point at strong demand in the to-be-reported quarter and 2017 as a whole.The company has also been experiencing strong buyer demand and good traffic into its communities. PulteGroup is also maximizing the value of its land assets by selling houses at higher prices and better margins, thereby using the resulting strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay off debt and systematically return to shareholders.All these are likely to help the company in reporting better-than-expected earnings, driven by higher closing volumes and average selling price. Unit closings is anticipated in the range of 4,850–5,050 in the second quarter.However, rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps) year over year to 23.2% in the first quarter of 2017. That said, PulteGroup expects home sales gross margin to increase 30 bps to 60 bps sequentially from first quarter level.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 45 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 20.7% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $2.03 billion, implying 12.8% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that PulteGroup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1227,PHM,"Recovering from the hurricanes, U.S. homebuilders’ confidence gained 4 points from the previous month in October, resulting in a confidence level of 68 — the highest since May 2017. Also, it improved from the year-ago figure of 63.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. A reading above 50 is considered positive. Notably, all three HMI components gained in October.Though builders have recovered from uncertainties created by the hurricanes, labor shortage and higher material costs will continue to pose concerns. Builders need to be wary about the fact that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive material costs higher, causing delays.It is important to note that the index dipped 3 points in September from August but still remained at a confident level of 64 points. Thus, though the homebuilding industry might face some bottlenecks in the short term as is evident from the lackluster home sales data for the July-August period, the overall picture is pretty compelling.Housing got off to a solid start this year and the trend is expected to continue through next year, courtesy of healthy demand, strong economic growth, historically low mortgage rates, escalating rent costs and easy availability of loans.The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) so far this year despite dampeners. The industry has gained 41.1%, compared with the S&P 500 index’s 14.2% increase. Notably, the homebuilding industry ranks among the top 29% of all Zacks industries. Along with a strong past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors. Major homebuilders like Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report),Toll Brothers Inc.

1232,PHM,"Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before market opens.Repair and remodel activity has been a key growth driver, contributing 80% to Masco’s revenues. Strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution led to a 3% increase in North American sales in the first nine months of 2017. KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, came up with a solid performance in retail and dealer channels, delivering double-digit growth on increased volumes in third-quarter 2017. The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter.Let us take a look at the other factors that are likely to influence Q4 results:Product Innovation & DivestituresProduct innovation also plays a pivotal role in driving results. Masco regularly invests in new products across its brands. Moreover, the company regularly divests less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on core areas to accelerate growth. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million. Sales and operating profit will be impacted by approximately $18 million and $5 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter due to the sale of Arrow Fastener.Segment PerformanceComing to the different reportable segments, Plumbing Products, comprising about 46% of total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in faucet, shower and spa businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $958 million reflects growth of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.The Cabinets segment is expected to see dismal growth this quarter owing to the impact of hurricanes. The company expects a $5-million hit to revenues in the fourth quarter that will largely impact the Cabinetry segment. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $238 million reflects year-over-year growth of just 1.7%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 4.3% year over year in the fourth quarter owing to strong pro paint growth and Liberty Hardware business, while revenues at Windows and Other Specialty Products are expected to decline 2.1%.Cost-Saving InitiativesMasco expects approximately $8 million in reset costs in the fourth quarter pertaining to a cabinet hardware program. Also, the company will incur approximately $5-$10 million in advertising costs as it is now resetting its display sets across the United States.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s cost-saving initiatives that have been driving margins over the past few quarters. Such initiatives include business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch shut downs, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reduction. Notably, operating margins improved 40 basis points in the first nine months of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.84 billion, implying 4.4% growth. The improvement in the top line is expected to be driven by increased revenues from the Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments. This is likely to translate into higher earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 43 cents, reflecting a 30.3% year-over-year increase.Quantitative Model PredictionPer the quantitative model, Masco does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to beat earnings.Masco has an Earnings ESP of -0.31% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1234,PHM,"Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) has been exhibiting robust performance on solid housing demand which in turn is helping the company to offset escalating building material and labor costs. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 results reflected solid top and bottom-line performance with a year-over-year increase of 18% and 42.6%, respectively. Earnings and revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Additionally, Toll Brothers raised its fiscal 2017 guidance.ProspectsGiven significant pent-up demand for housing and limited competition in luxury homes in the United States, Toll Brothers has managed to drive revenues on pricing strength. In fact, the third quarter of fiscal 2017 marked the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in contract (in terms of dollars and units), with double-digit increases in each of the last four quarters. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, total revenues of $3.79 billion rose 14% and deliveries of 4,727 units increased 22% from the prior-year period. The company’s net signed contracts of $5.07 billion and 6,196 units increased 21% and 24%, respectively, in the same period. Toll Brothers also achieved double-digit growth in earnings, revenues, contracts and backlog in fiscal 2016.Furthermore, Toll Brothers is using its strong liquidity position to secure the most sought-after urban locations in the country like New York City Market, Northern New Jersey, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. Buoyed by a compelling U.S. homebuilding industry and solid land position, the company enjoys a competitive edge over peers who are presently facing land availability constraints.Banking on an enhanced housing scenario and remarkable top-line growth, Toll Brothers raised its fiscal 2017 guidance in its third-quarter earnings call. Revenues for fiscal 2017 are projected in the band of $5.6 billion to $6 billion (previous guidance $5.4-$6.1 billion), compared with $5.17 billion in fiscal 2016. Moreover, home deliveries are anticipated in the range of 7,000 to 7,300 units (previously 6,950-7,450) at an average price of $800,000-$825,000.ConcernsAlthough the current macroeconomic conditions are favorable for home buyers owing to a historically-low mortgage rate and a solid job market scenario, a shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor, escalating land prices, and higher material costs are exerting pressure on margins of Toll Brothers as well as other homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and others.In fact, Toll Brothers’ adjusted gross margin declined 30 basis points (bps) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects its adjusted gross margin in the range of 24.8-25% for fiscal 2017, marginally lower than the previous guidance of 24.8-25.3%.Nonetheless, a strong brand presence, a significant number of owned lots and a pricing power over competitors are likely to boost sales.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1235,PHM,"Earnings yield is a very simple but handy ratio for investors keeping their money in stocks or bonds. It is the reciprocal of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and used to figure out undervalued stocks. This ratio is very useful for investors when they want to compare stocks with the market or fixed income securities.Earnings Yield is calculated as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100. It is used to compare a stock with other stocks as well as with fixed income securities. While comparing similar stocks, the one with higher earnings yield should provide better returns.This ratio also comes handy in comparing the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. When the yield of the market index is higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered as undervalued in comparison to bonds. This implies that investing in the stock market is a better option for a value investor.However, while T-bills are risk free, investing in stocks always comes with a caveat. Hence, it would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market.The Winning StrategyWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion, but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment.

1236,PHM,"Homebuilding company, PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24 before the market opens.PulteGroup is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Homebuilders have been doing well courtesy of steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation, and a limited supply of inventory. These positive trends point at strong demand in the to-be-reported quarter and 2017 as a whole.Homebuilding, comprising about 97.5% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.3 billion reflect growth of 17.6% sequentially and 22.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $54 million indicates an increase of 14.2% from the prior quarter and 12.5% year over year.The company has also been experiencing strong buyer demand and good traffic into its communities. PulteGroup is also maximizing the value of its land assets by selling houses at higher prices and better margins, thereby using the resulting strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay off debt and systematically return to shareholders.All these are likely to help the company in reporting better-than-expected earnings, driven by higher closing volumes and average selling price. The company expects unit closings in the range of 5,400-5,600 in the third quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net new orders of 5,330 units reflects a decline of 16.7% from the prior quarter but is likely to witness a 11.6% increase year over year.Again, rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Home sales gross margin decreased 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2017. That said, PulteGroup expects gross margin in the range of 23.6-24.1%, implying an increase of 20 bps to 70 bps sequentially for both the third and fourth quarters.Apart from higher land/labor costs, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to have a negative impact on the company’s results to some extent.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying 19.8% growth. The solid improvement in the top line is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 59 cents, reflecting a 37.2% year-over-year increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.PulteGroup does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PulteGroup is -6.22%.Zacks Rank: PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1238,PHM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PulteGroup has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.8. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts PulteGroup’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 14.0) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PulteGroup has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PulteGroup’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PulteGroup has a P/S ratio of about 1.1. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PulteGroup currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PHM a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for PulteGroup is just 0.9, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PHM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though PulteGroup might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives PHM a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past thirty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1.7% in the past one month, while the full year estimate has dipped nearly 1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PulteGroup, Inc. Price and Consensus  PulteGroup, Inc. Price and Consensus | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.  Bottom LinePulteGroup is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 23% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1239,PHM,"Sales of previously owned homes jumped in February, marking the first gain in the last three months. This means that more Americans are looking to buy homes despite rising prices and a limited availability of homes.Exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry jumped on Wednesday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) gained 1.6% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) increased 0.9%. Meanwhile, PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) was up 0.7%.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) surged 3.7%, 2.9%, 2.1%, 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, in the last session.Now, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) has adopted a more hawkish stance, do investors need to worry about the momentum of the U.S. housing market? The latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry’s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages.February Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales increased 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. Sales increased 1.1% from the year-ago level. This surge in existing-home sales (accounting for 90% of the market) after declining sales in the last two months indicates that competition will heat up during the traditional spring home-buying season.Regionally, sales were mixed. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest plunged 12.3% and 2.4%, respectively. However, sales surged 11.4% in the West and increased 6.6% in the Midwest.Meanwhile, February’s median sales price grew 5.9% from the comparable period a year ago to $241,700, marking the 72nd straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continued to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 8.1% from the year-ago period. However, housing inventory increased 4.6% from January. It would take just 3.4 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Fed’s Hawkish Stance: A Boon or Bane for Housing?As expected, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% in its first policy meeting under the new chief Jerome Powell, on March 21. The central bank also indicated that there will be at least two more hikes for 2018, highlighting its rising confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy. Fed officials see a stronger U.S. economy and signaled a slightly faster pace of interest rate hikes in the coming years.Meanwhile, according to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage moved higher for the fifth straight month to 4.33% in February (highest since 4.34% in April 2014) from 4.03% in January.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed creating hurdles for buyers (mostly first-time buyers). In February, first-time buyers comprised 29% of sales, which is down from 31% a year ago but unchanged from the prior month. However, NAR holds a bullish stance stating that a solid U.S. economy accompanied with a healthy labor market will help the housing market reap solid gains.Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, pointed out, “Mortgage rates are at their highest level in nearly four years, at a time when home prices are still climbing at double the pace of wage growth.” He further added, “Homes for sale are going under contract a week faster than a year ago, which is quite remarkable given weakening affordability conditions and extremely tight supply. To fully satisfy demand, most markets right now need a substantial increase in new listings.”Latest homebuilders’ confidence reading for March was also solid at 70 fueled by growing consumer demand. In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid economy and cheerful job market is keeping the industry alive. With these strong economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.Notably, following the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed now expects faster economic growth of 2.7% this year, up from the forecast of 2.5% in December. For 2019, GDP growth is now expected to be 2.4%, up from the previously projected 2.1%. The Fed now projects the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8% this year from the present rate of 4.1%, which is a positive for the housing industry.4 Homebuilding Stocks to Bet OnWe have zeroed in on four homebuilding stocks that are worth investing in with solid growth potential amid above-mentioned woes.Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH  -  Free Report) is one of the leading homebuilders in the United States.
