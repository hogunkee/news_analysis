0,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) will pay $1 billion to settle U.S. probes into mistreatment of consumers, the largest sanction of a U.S. bank under President Donald Trump, as the firm tries to resolve a year and a half of scandals across its operations.The bank will pay $500 million in penalties each to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to a CFPB statement Friday. Wells Fargo warned shareholders last week it would soon face a fine of that size, which it planned to book retroactively in the first quarter. The bank remains under a Federal Reserve penalty that bans growth in total assets.The settlement covers issues in Wells Fargo's auto-lending and mortgage units. The bank revealed last year that it had forced unwanted insurance on customers who took out car loans, prompting investigations by U.S. and California regulators. It was also accused of imposing inappropriate charges for locking in interest rates on new home loans.""We have said all along that we will enforce the law,"" Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the CFPB, said in the statement. ""That is what we did here.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChief Executive Officer Tim Sloan, who took the helm after scandals began erupting in 2016, shuffled management and promised to overhaul the bank's culture and controls to rebuild public trust. Ensuing scrutiny — some initiated by the bank itself — exposed more misconduct that had festered for years. The company even caught the ire of Trump, who tweeted in December it should face heightened penalties for ""bad acts against their customers.""Wells Fargo announced preliminary results for the first quarter on April 13, saying net income came in at a better-than-expected $5.53 billion, or $1.12 a share. This would be the second straight quarter that legal costs hurt results. In the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo booked a record $3.25 billion charge related to regulatory investigations, sales practices and other matters.""We recognize that it will take time to put all of our challenges behind us,"" Sloan said in the April 13 statement.The latest settlement matches the biggest-ever for the OCC. It is also a record for the CFPB, which hasn't announced any new enforcement cases since Mick Mulvaney started running the bureau in November. Mulvaney, a former GOP congressman who once called the bureau a ""sad, sick joke,"" has faced criticism from Democratic lawmakers for going easy on companies and slow-walking investigations.Wells Fargo's troubles began mounting in September of 2016, when authorities fined the firm $185 million for opening millions of accounts without customers' permission. Then-CEO John Stumpf resigned, executives forfeited tens of millions of dollars in compensation, and, over time, much of the board was replaced.In February, the Fed cited a pattern of abuses and lapses while imposing an unprecedented sanction: Unless it gets special permission, the bank can't boost total assets beyond their level at the end of 2017 until it addresses its shortcomings.The nation's third-largest lender by assets still faces scrutiny, with the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission examining the wealth-management unit, a person familiar with the probes has said. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told journalists on April 13 that investigations into the division are ""midway through.""Wells Farog rose 0.7% to 51.91 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today.Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 15% this year through Thursday, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index.

1,WFC,"The big banks have their tax cuts, a good economy and higher interest rates. They also dumped a whole bunch of extra returns on shareholders last month. But as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) prepare to report second-quarter earnings on Friday, big bank stocks have been in a mass slide lower.XDread over a flattening yield curve, and its potential foreshadowing of a recession, has crept into bank stocks this year. Lending has picked up. But it remains slow overall, and businesses are still skittish about borrowing money to expand. The Trump administration is flinging tariffs at China and criticizing NAFTA, adding to businesses' ambivalence. Deposit costs are rising, crimping profits.""We had a benefit from corporate tax reform that was good for a lot of these companies, and there isn't a lot of evidence that they've invested very much in their businesses,"" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said.He said Q2 bank earnings this month will likely be more defined by management's outlook for the rest of the year, as banks — and their large and small clients — assess whether a strong U.S. economy can stomach a trade war.Keefe-Bruyette & Woods forecasts median second-quarter loan growth of 2.8% for JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America (BAC). For the year, KBW expects median loan growth for those banks of 3.1%.Nonetheless, KBW said it expects the banks to put up ""solid"" results. The firm said that ""fundamentals will support further outperformance once geopolitical risks dissipate.""

Analysts see revenue up 8% to $27.54 billion.Also expected: CEO Jamie Dimon, who missed JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings call in April, will be in attendance. Dimon often uses the bank's quarterly earnings to weigh in on the economy and Washington. His reflections on the economy in earnings releases and annual shareholder letters have the feel of a Warren Buffet-esque fireside chat. His remarks on earnings calls? Not always so much.""He has the potential to create some fireworks here,"" Shanahan said of Dimon. ""I'm kind of looking forward to what he has to say about Trump's policies as it relates to corporate taxes, tariffs, and this trade war, which, arguably, we're in now.""Dimon's return would reunite him with his more measured counterpart, CFO Marianne Lake, who tends to do most of the talking during the calls.Lake, after the bank's first-quarter results in April, said it was too early to tell if businesses were borrowing more due to tax cuts. Earlier that month, Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders that ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war creates risk and uncertainty to the global economic system.""The Trump administration this week said it planned to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.

That's essentially where the stock was at the beginning of the year.At the core of investors' anxiety over the banks is the yield curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt. The yield curve is also a reflection on investors' longer-term expectations of inflation and the strength of an economy able to get away with higher prices.Short-term rates influence the rates at which banks borrow money from depositors. The long end influences the rates they set on money they lend to others. Banks' margins depend on the gap between those two.The Fed has bumped up short-term rates, in turn pushing up what banks can charge on things like credit-card and auto loans. But the long end has wavered, reflecting a dimmer view of the economy further out.Citigroup is expected to report a 23% increase in EPS to $1.56, as revenue increases 3% to $18.46 billion.The bank is the most internationally exposed of the big banks, drawing only half of its revenue from North America last year, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Fourteen percent came from Latin America.Citigroup has been bullish on business prospects in Mexico, saying in April that it expected ""continued revenue growth"" in the nation. Citi at that time also noted ""momentum"" in its card and retail banking businesses there.Mexico, however, this month elected as president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a staunch leftist who rode a populist, anti-establishment wave to victory. He has called Trump ""erratic and arrogant."" But after his election win, he said he would aim for ""friendly relations"" with the U.S. Obrador has also said he wants Mexico to stay in NAFTA.KBW last month also noted that Citigroup, at a recent conference, said ""the economy (in Mexico) could slow either on the back of no NAFTA or renegotiated NAFTA or an outcome of a presidential election on July 1."" But the bank still remained bullish on growth.Citigroup dipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Shares are down 8% year-to-date.Zacks forecasts a 5% increase in Wells Fargo's earnings per share to $1.12. Revenue is seen slipping 3% to $21.58 billion.Wells Fargo is still trying to recover following revelations that it created unauthorized customer accounts in an attempt to boost sales.

7,WFC,"The Federal Reserve just devised a harsh new punishment after Wells Fargo (WFC) landed in scandal after scandal — one that may haunt every big bank.X The San Francisco-based lender was banned late Friday from growing until it convinces authorities it's addressing shortcomings — an action that could cost it $400 million in profit this year. Untested is how the cap on total assets will affect the firm long term by handing its largest competitors an advantage in pursuing new business.Even as the Trump administration signals a loosening of regulations across industries including Wall Street, the Fed's move sets a scary tone. In an industry where public scorn seems to shift every few years to another colossal U.S. firm, without necessarily hampering growth, this year it's Wells Fargo — next year, who knows?""The Fed just put the fear of God into bank boardrooms across the country,"" Capital Alpha Partners LLC analyst Ian Katz said in a Sunday note. ""Since the financial crisis, bank boards have gradually become more serious and less rubber-stampy. But the Wells scandals indicate that some boards still aren't vigilant enough.""Shares of the company tumbled nearly 8% to 59.01 soon after the open on the stock market today.Wells Fargo is moving to rectify the regulators' concerns, said spokesman Oscar Suris.""As Friday's consent order acknowledges, Wells Fargo has made progress in enhancing its board governance and compliance and risk management, and that work continues through the consent-order process and ongoing actions such as recent key outside hires and additions to the board,"" Suris said Sunday in an emailed statement. ""The company is confident that under Chair Betsy Duke and CEO Tim Sloan we will move swiftly to address the issues.""In 2013, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) agreed to more than $23 billion in legal and regulatory settlements as the bank sought to resolve probes in areas including energy trading, oversight of services to Ponzi-scheme operator Bernard Madoff and mortgage-linked dealings by the bank and firms it acquired. The next year its assets grew by $157 billion.In late 2011, mounting fines and liabilities over Bank of America's (BAC) role in the housing collapse pushed its stock price below $5. Still, the bank was able to add more than $80 billion in assets the following year.The Wells Fargo sanction — called unprecedented by Fed officials — arguably marks an apex for central-bank enforcement actions that have been ratcheting up in recent years.The Fed has at times put a bank's growth in check, such as in 2005 when it told Citigroup (C) that it was expected to not undertake ""significant expansion"" until it addressed the issues that gave rise to numerous compliance failures. But before the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed wasn't known for punishing lenders.During former Chair Janet Yellen's tenure it changed course, routinely banning bankers from the industry who had been accused of misconduct and joining other regulators in imposing billions of dollars in fines on Wall Street firms.What's unclear is whether Wells Fargo's sanction reflect how the Fed will do business going forward, or if it's the capstone of a more aggressive enforcement posture that could now start receding.President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to loosen constraints on the financial industry, is increasingly putting his stamp on the central bank. His pick, Jay Powell, succeeds Yellen. Former Carlyle Group LP executive Randal Quarles is now responsible for the Fed's oversight of large banks, and last month the Trump appointee laid out his road map for easing aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other rules.Quarles said his plans include altering regulations that have forced lenders to hold bigger capital cushions, revising Volcker Rule trading restrictions and making annual stress tests that examine whether firms can endure another economic meltdown less burdensome. Quarles, who became the Fed's vice chair of supervision in October, had no involvement with the Wells Fargo case because family ties have prompted him to recuse himself from all matters tied to the lender.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said the Fed's action shows that regulators must be vigilant across the industry.""We need more regulators to be willing to use all of the regulatory tools at their disposal to deal with bad actors like Wells Fargo,"" she said.The Fed's move presents an opportunity for other banking giants, according to Betsy Graseck, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. Wells Fargo is coming off a year when its loans fell for the first time since 2010 as the bank grappled with fallout from the scandals and pulled back in auto lending. Any reliance on the consumer business for growth would come as the bank is shrinking its branch network.""I would think every competitor is looking at this saying, 'OK, Wells is going to be on the back foot for the full year so let's go after market share,"" Graseck said Friday as analysts grilled Sloan on Wells Fargo's conference call.A ""very small number"" of Wells Fargo's existing customers will be affected by the bank's need to dial back some activities, Sloan said on the call. Among them will be other banks that have parked some of their money at Wells Fargo, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. Ditching those high-cost deposits could end up boosting Wells Fargo's net interest margin, Shrewsberry said.Sloan, the bank's chief executive since October 2016, isn't in imminent danger, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.""Sloan can stay as long as there is no additional scandal,"" Peabody said. ""You've got to have the shareholders on board to change management. I don't sense you have it there yet.""Still, in a Sunday note, Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin summed up concerns about the potential for more sanctions or nervous investors dumping shares by asking whether the Fed's action was the ""end of the beginning or beginning of the end.""

8,WFC,"Congress is set to give a bunch of banks more of what they want — which is to say, fewer regulators in their lives — with legislation making its way through the Senate this week.X The Senate on Tuesday voted to begin debate on a bill that would free some banks from taking stress tests, drafting plans to show how they'd wind down in a crisis, and being ""too big to fail.""The legislation has the backing of the GOP and some Democrats, and could pass the chamber this week. But how will it actually affect the biggest banks, like Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and others?""In a very limited way,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said. ""The bill is geared toward smaller banks — banks under $250 billion in assets.""He later added: ""You'll see this rhetoric that this going back to the bad old days, and this is, say, a giveaway to the big banks. Not to the biggest banks it's not.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11
"
9,WFC,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio. Custodian banks, like Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and Northern Trust (NTRS) would be the likeliest to benefit.But JPMorgan and Citi, which also handle similar deposits, argue that provision should apply to them as well. Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today.

10,WFC,"Wall Street was caught off guard on Friday as the Labor Department reported average hourly wage growth of 2.9%, the fastest since 2009 and a pretty sharp break from the kind of Goldilocks readings markets enjoyed throughout 2017.X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on the stock market today, despite a 6% surge in Amazon.com (AMZN) after its fourth-quarter earnings beat. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a 4-year high of 2.84%, as markets continue to ratchet up the odds of three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018.But the market reaction to the jobs report may be overdone. While faster wage growth may be on the way, helped by the combination of a tight labor market and corporate tax cuts that companies like Walmart (WMT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have credited for new wage hikes, Friday's report offers plenty of reasons to doubt whether wages really accelerated last month. Here are three:Big industries that pay low wages saw some of the biggest drops in hours worked. The retail workweek, for example, shrank by a half-hour, or 1.6%, to 30.6 hours per week, the shortest since BLS began tracking it for all employees in 2006. Retail pays its nearly 16 million workers $18.41 an hour, on average, far below the $26.74 average earned by private-sector workers last month.Meanwhile, the average workweek dropped 0.8% in the leisure and hospitality sector, which pays its 16.25 million workers $15.73 an hour, on average.Those two industries, which account for 1 in 4 private-sector workers, saw disproportionately large declines in their workweek. Average hourly wages reflect total weekly wages divided by total hours worked in all industry groups, so when low-wage workers put in fewer hours, the average wage rises.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank, notes that the overall 0.5% decline in working hours was the biggest since April 2013. In addition to the tendency of lower-paid hourly wage workers to have their workweek cut, Bandholz notes that workers with a fixed salary appear to get a pay raise when they work fewer hours. He figures the shorter workweek artificially inflated earnings by nearly 0.2 percentage point.Production and supervisory workers, about 80% of total private-sector employment, saw steady hourly wage growth of 2.4% in January. If their wages aren't breaking out to the upside, then chances are it's not a real economywide trend.Likewise, goods-producing industries saw wage growth tick down to 2.3% from 2.4% in December.Taken together, that means the wage acceleration, if there is one, is focused on service-sector managers.""Some of that (wage) increase may have been influenced by one-time bonuses paid by some corporations after the passage of the tax reform bill,"" wrote Jefferies economist Thomas Simons. In other words, the spike in bonuses paid just after the start of the year may have skewed the average hourly wage calculation.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action, IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Although January's wage acceleration was likely overstated, the report generally appears to indicate continued labor market strength. The U.S. economy added a better-than-expected 200,000 jobs in January, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, as expected.There is reason to expect stronger wage gains in coming months. Walmart hiked its base wage to $11 an hour, but that won't show up in paychecks for another month or so. The retail giant also reportedly cut 3,500 store co-manager positions, while adding about 1,700 somewhat lower paid assistant manager positions. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo boosted its minimum wage to $15 an hour, as did a host of other banks.November and December job gains were revised down by a combined 24,000, leaving the average monthly job gain at 192,000 over the past three months, the government said.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Fourth-Quarter Earnings Smash Estimates; Sales Growth StrongHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

12,WFC,"Bank stocks just hit a record — a record of losses. The S&P 500 Financials Index fell for the 13th straight day Wednesday, the longest losing streak on record.Coming into the year, many cited the tax overhaul and a rising rate environment as reasons for banks to rally. Instead, they've endured pressure from a flattening yield curve. The losses also come ahead of the final phase of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests and waning consumer confidence.""They're facing a rising rate environment, which historically has been fairly positive for banks,"" Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said on Bloomberg Television. ""What we're seeing here is the shrinking yield curve is actually not a good sign for the banks. Obviously, they like to borrow short, lend long, and if that yield curve is shrinking, that margin goes down as well.""The S&P 500 Financials Index fell 1.3% to $437.95 on Wednesday. Citigroup (C) fell 1.3%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) gave up 0.3%.

Through Tuesday, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, ticker XLF, had seen eight straight days of outflows, the longest streak in two years. Together, that amounted to nearly $1.8 billion in withdrawals from the fund, about 6% of its total market cap.In addition to a flattening yield curve casting a shadow over bank profits, the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests loom ahead of Thursday results. That's when the Federal Reserve approves or rejects banks' plans to return money to shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. All 35 banks tested passed the first round of tests last week, but not every one cleared the bar by a comfortable margin.""The Fed stress tests are proving to be a 'sell the news' event as the yield curve collapses,"" said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading Institutional Services.What's more, U.S. consumer confidence fell in June, a signal that could affect the path of interest rate hikes this year and beyond. Although the Fed is largely expected to raise rates at their meeting in September, the probability for a rate hike at that time has come down from 81% on Thursday to 78.8%.""Fed officials are narrowly split on the need to raise rates three or four times this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""Diminished confidence readings on the consumer may be all it takes for one Fed official to change their vote.

15,WFC,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that he still sees evidence of modest slack in the labor market, meaning the economy still has room to grow without rising inflation pressures.X ""Nothing (in the data) suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration,"" Powell said.Powell's remarks were at least somewhat soothing to Wall Street, coming after the main takeaway from his Tuesday appearance before a House panel was that the economy will grow at a faster pace this year than Fed policymakers had anticipated when they penciled in three rate hikes by the end of 2018.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported early Thursday that the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose a tame 1.5% from a year ago in January, as expected.Although the Institute of Supply Management reported that national factory activity in February grew at its fastest pace since 2004 and jobless claims hit a 48-year low, Powell's less-hawkish testimony left Treasury yields little changed in early afternoon trading. Treasury yields dipped by the close as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on the stock market today as President Trump vowed to impose a 25% steel tariff, raising trade war fears.Inflation has been undershooting expectations for years, so it may seem odd that markets are so focused on the threat now. Yet there's good reason to think that 2018 will be the year when price pressures begin to surface, at least to a moderate extent.That's not to say inflation is about to spike. The war for retail dominance between Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), the transparency in pricing afforded by the internet and disruptive business models like Airbnb are a legitimate game-changer. A push by the FDA to expedite generic drug approvals is likely to continue to help keep a lid on prescription prices.While such disinflationary fundamentals aren't going away, a host of forces are lining up this year that have potential to finally push inflation up to the Fed's 2% goal.The combination of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and $300 billion spending package is expected to shift an economy that had already picked up speed into still-higher gear.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersStepping on the fiscal accelerator in the ninth year of an economic expansion amid solid growth is an experiment that's never been tried, and it's likely to add to upward cyclical pressure to inflation that tends to emerge when demand for labor and resources rises.With economic optimism on the rise and more dollars in their pocket, consumers may be, on the margins, more receptive to price hikes. Companies that have recently announced price increases include Amazon, which hiked fees for monthly Prime members; Disney (DIS), which raised theme park ticket prices for single-day guests; and Wendy's (WEN), which said on its latest earnings call that it raised prices by 1% in January to offset higher wages and commodity costs.Whether or not the tax cuts really deserve the credit, companies such as Walmart, CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) gave a nod to the tax legislation when they subsequently announced pay hikes.Wage growth looks like it will take another step up from the Goldilocks-like 2.5% gain in average hourly wages that prevailed for most of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Fed policymakers often talk about full employment, the lowest that unemployment can go before inflation starts to accelerate. No one knows exactly where it is and some economists, citing the experience of Japan, have doubts about the theory. Still, some economists expect unemployment to get as low as 3.5% this year, and new Fed chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that 3.5%, in his view, is the lowest imaginable rate of full employment, though he think it might be quite a bit higher.Some industries, such as trucking, are seeing above-average wage gains because the job market for hiring and retaining drivers is especially competitive. Those extra wages tend to get passed along. While transportation makes up a relatively small fraction of a retailer's costs, those extra costs, along with higher retail wages, could affect the end consumer — even if it only results in less discounting.Most inflation tends to be services inflation, so even flat prices for goods would be inflationary.Fed policymakers have said for much of the past year that transitory factors may have only temporarily lowered inflation. One such factor was Verizon (VZ) changing its cell-phone service pricing to provide unlimited data. Because that change began to lower inflation data in March 2017, that temporary factor will drop out of the picture this coming March,Crude oil prices, at about $61.50 per barrel, are about $7 higher than a year ago, boosting the price of gasoline. While the Fed's core gauge of inflation excludes energy prices, higher energy prices can get passed along to consumers. Delta Air Lines (DAL) is among a number of airlines that have tried to pass along higher fuel costs to customers through price hikes recently. So far, those hikes haven't taken hold, but stayed tuned.The U.S. dollar is more than 10% cheaper than it was a year ago, relative to a basket of other currencies from advanced economies. That raises the price of industrial commodities and a range of imported goods. At the least, a rising dollar is no longer working to hold down inflation in the U.S. by making foreign goods cheaper in dollar terms. A weakening dollar, at least at the margins, adds to inflation pressures. Import prices rose for German cars, French cheese and Italian wine, though it's not clear the extent to which end consumers will face higher prices, since consumers have the option of buying nonimports.President Trump has until mid-April to make up his mind over whether to impose tariffs on steel imports, as recommended the Commerce Department. Investors in U.S. Steel (X) appear to be betting that Trump will pull the trigger. Higher steel prices would add costs to cars made in the U.S., though it's not clear how automakers will respond when it comes to auto prices.Another question is how foreign governments will retaliate if the U.S. enacts punitive trade measures that they believe are unwarranted under World Trade Organization rules.The possibility of a trade war that then forfeits some of the disinflationary effects of globalization is among the biggest wild cards in the inflation outlook.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED INInflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

19,WFC,"Starbucks (SBUX) says it's getting a $350 million tax cut this year from a 7-percentage-point reduction in its effective tax rate to 26%.""The majority of the savings will go to the bottom line,"" CFO Scott Maw told analysts on Thursday. The other 40%-plus will go to investments in workers, via wage and benefit enhancements, as well as digital investments.X Starbucks joined companies like Wal-Mart (WMT), FedEx (FDX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in tying wage increases to the Trump tax cuts. Meanwhile, dozens of other companies including AT&T (T), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ) have awarded bonuses to well more than 1 million workers, crediting tax cuts for their generosity.With the U.S. economy seemingly ready to finally shift into high gear and wage growth overdue for a pickup amid 4.1% unemployment, the flurry of wage-hike and bonus announcements has raised hopes that the GOP tax reform will provide rocket fuel for a late-1990s-style growth spurt. In a sign that economic growth is breaking out to the upside, the 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.67% on Friday, a level not seen since early 2014.Yet there are reasons to be skeptical that a major economic and wage acceleration is at hand. Take Verizon, which on Tuesday said that tax reform would shrink its 2018 tax bill by $3.5 billion-$4 billion. Yet the company hasn't settled on any plans for deploying that cash windfall, other than sending about 10% of it, or $380 million, to employees via a bonus grant of 50 shares of stock per full-time worker. While those Verizon shares are worth about $2,700 at Friday's close on the stock market today, economists generally believe that consumers are much more likely to spend ongoing income gains than gains in paper wealth.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is ranked No. 11 by IBD in the Retail-Restaurants industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Restaurants have turned in a middling performance as a group, ranked No. 84 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.On a static basis, leaving out growth effects, tax cuts are supposed to provide roughly $200 billion in 2018 to the corporate and household sectors, equal to about 1% of GDP. While lower federal tax withholdings are set to take effect in February, raising household take-home pay, tax cuts are initially geared more to the business sector. That's in part because the new withholding will reflect the elimination of personal exemptions, but not the doubling of the child tax credit, which won't get paid until tax season in 2019.That means this year's boost from tax cuts will depend a whole lot on what companies do with their windfalls, though it's also looking like Congress will reach a spending deal that further boosts deficits and gives the economy a lift — assuming the government doesn't shut down again.Yet company after company seems to be signaling that they have fairly modest plans for putting their extra cash to work. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) told analysts last week that corporate tax reform would boost earnings and cash flow by $1.7 billion in 2018 after an additional investment and added operating expenses of $200 million to $300 million in artificial intelligence, data analytics, digital health and other initiatives.Iron-ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) said it's getting a $250 million cash infusion over the next several years and will owe no tax for years to come. It's still figuring out how to put the cash to work but said it ""will be primarily deployed towards debt reduction, as well as future CapEx needs associated with our core business, and last but not least, potential capital returns to shareholders,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Railroad operator Union Pacific expects tax cuts to add $1 billion to free cash flow this year but doesn't have any extra investment plans for now. ""The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad,"" CEO Lance Fritz told analysts. ""Just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us.""It's still very possible that the economy finally breaks the 3% GDP growth barrier this year. The economy may not need all that much extra fuel right now with labor markets already quite tight.Although income gains outweigh stock market gains, a long, powerful bull market will surely loosen purse strings. Wal-Mart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour may lead other employers to follow suit, if the experience from their last big wage hike in 2016 is any guide.The upfront bonuses, while surely appreciated by those who get them, are mostly meant to buy goodwill — probably both for the employers and the Republican Party, whose control of both the House and Senate are at risk in the coming elections.Still, the effectiveness of corporate tax cuts and their power to trickle down to employees can't really be judged in the short term.The whole idea is that improving the relative attractiveness of the U.S. as a place of business will, over time, lead to more productivity-enhancing investment, faster growth, more demand for labor and higher wages. Yet the real legacy of the tax cuts over the longer term will depend in part on just how bad budget deficits get, which may determine whether the tax cuts can be sustained over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

21,WFC,"U.S. stock indexes were mixed Monday afternoon as the Nasdaq battled to a respectable gain. Earlier, the stock market had to deal with discouraging comments from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Ross, who many regard as a protectionist, said President Trump would not change his stance on trade no matter how far the stock market fell.The Nasdaq chalked up a 0.3% gain, while the S&P 500 inched down 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%. The small cap S&P 600 added 0.1%.Volume was lower across the board.Among sector exchange traded funds, Invesco KBW Bank (KBWB) advanced 0.4%. Wells Fargo (WFC), one of the fund's top holdings, popped 1.1% higher.

22,WFC,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

The 10-year Treasury yield on April 25 hit 3% for the first time since 2014, reflecting expectations that the Fed may raise interest rates four times this year.Banks' profit margins tend to increase when rates rise. But concerns about the flattening Treasury yield curve, which is at its flattest levels since before the 2007 recession, have pressured the big banks' stocks.Banks ranked No. 15 Tuesday out of the 33 sectors tracked by IBD.

29,WFC,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will hold its annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, an event likely to draw thousands seeking financial enlightenment from Warren Buffett, the conglomerate's billionaire CEO and Wall Street's quintessential grandfather figure.Here's a look at what to expect from the meeting that has been called the Woodstock of Capitalism.Buffett, in his 2017 shareholder letter, said ""America's economic soil remains fertile."" While President Trump has cut corporate taxes, he's also threatened to start a trade war with China. Markets also are worried about inflation and Fed rate hikes. Those developments could color whatever sweeping declarations Buffett might make about the nation's economy.In September, a JPMorgan analyst wrote that Buffett, 87, ""shows no signs of slowing and could possibly be at the helm for another decade."" But in January, Buffett appointed two insiders — Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain — to Berkshire Hathaway's board. He said they are ""key figures"" that ""both have Berkshire in their blood.""

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were tacking toward their second straight weekly slip, and the Dow was set to extend its losing streak to three weeks.

Instead, the Fed held the banks' payouts to levels from prior years, saying that the companies, in effect, needed to save more money.Wells Fargo shares received the largest boost among big banks from the Fed's stress-test report. The San Francisco-based bank, which spent years in the hot seat regarding its practices during the financial crisis, received approval from the Fed for its balance sheet and capital spending plans. As a result, the company late Thursday raised its quarterly dividend to 43 cents from 39 cents, and announced plans to throw an additional $15 billion into its share-buyback program. Shares rose nearly 3% in after-hours trade.Citibank (C) rose 2.2% as it boosted its dividend 41% to 45 cents and launched a $17.6 billion share buyback.JPMorgan climbed 1.6% in Friday's premarket trade. It hiked its quarterly payout 43% to 54 cents and said it would buy back up to $20.7 billion in stock.Nike was the Dow's heavy hitter after hours. It scrambled up nearly 10% after reporting its North American sales had turned around after a three-quarter slide. Revenue and earnings growth topped analyst consensus targets, and the company announced a $15 billion share buyback.Nike shares ended Thursday in a test of the 10-week moving average and it's creating a buy range at that level. The new buy zone coincides with the buy area from a 70.35 buy point. Nike's retail wingman, Foot Locker (FL), also gained, rising 1.4% in late trade. Shares ended Thursday in a buy range above a cup-base buy point at 53.27.KB Home narrowed its gain to 1.7% early Friday, following fiscal second-quarter results that handily topped analysts' consensus views.

32,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) were among all 35 banks that passed the Federal Reserve's stress test, clearing a major hurdle toward huge hikes in capital returns.The Federal Reserve said the nation's largest banks are strongly capitalized, though Goldman Sachs (GS) came the closest to missing the mark, posting a leverage ratio of 3.1% vs. the Fed's minimum requirement of 3%.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a press release.The Dodd-Frank stress test results detail whether banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. This is the first of two tests. On June 28, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.Some analysts see a majority of banks making payouts that exceed profits for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo among them.""I don't think generally today's results, that everyone passed, are a big surprise to anybody. It was largely expected,"" Raymond James managing director Michael Rose said.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stress test actually being stricter this year.Under 2018's stress test scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak. This is tougher than the 6.5% drop that was modeled last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's stress test outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Banks will be able to unveil their capital return plans for the coming year following the release of the second set of results next Thursday. Those tests determine how large a capital buffer that banks need to protect themselves from a financial crisis.But Wells Fargo is at an elevated risk to fail the June 28 test due to oversight issues related to its account-opening scandal and perhaps a lack of focus by management on the exam due to the scandal, Rose said.""Even if everybody passes quantitatively, (Fed regulators have) historically made an example out of one or more banks on the qualitative side,"" he told IBD. ""I wouldn't expect them to deviate from that historical pattern when we get next week's CCAR results.""Shares of JPMorgan closed essentially unchanged on the stock market today. Bank of America rose 0.2% and Wells Fargo dipped 0.2%, while Citigroup gained 0.4%. Goldman Sachs fell 0.4% and Morgan Stanley (MS) slid 0.2%.After the close, Wells Fargo edged up, while the others fell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoldman analysts see State Street (STT), Wells Fargo and Northern Trust (NTRS) able to increase payout ratios the most among large-cap and trust banks. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Not everyone is quite so bullish, however. The likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James see the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks. This is around a quarter more than in 2017.""We look for the median bank's total payout ratio to approach 100%, while both dividends and share repurchase increase over 20% from CCAR 2017's level,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note. ""We believe the pace of dividend increases could exceed that of share repurchase.""There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.One fly in the ointment is the current flattening yield curve. This could lower profits, as banks make money on the difference between long- and short-term rates. The spread between U.S. Treasuries 2-year and 10-year yields has not been this narrow in a flattening process since 2005.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These Banks Are Seen Paying Out The Most To Investors After Stress TestWhy Tougher Bank Stress Test May Not Hurt Dividends, BuybacksIBD Stock Of The Day: Bank To The Tech Stars Sets Up Swing Trade, Add-On ChancesStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

33,WFC,"The majority of America's biggest banks are expected to pay shareholders more than they earn for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, despite this year's tougher stress test, and the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are leading the charge.XThe Federal Reserve will report Dodd-Frank stress-test results on Thursday, showing which banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. The following Thursday, June 28, the Fed will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.While individual banks have paid out more than they earned, this would be the first time since 2008 that it has happened at a majority of the top banks. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 13 out of the 25 banks it follows to be approved to pay out more than they earn over the next four quarters. Credit Suisse and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods also forecast the majority of banks will be allowed to hand over more capital than they make in profit.Goldman expects State Street (STT), Wells Fargo and Northern Trust (NTRS) to be able to increase payout ratios the most among large-cap and trust banks. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stricter stress test this year.Under this year's scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared with 6.5% last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's tests outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.3% on the stock market today despite a broad sell-off.

34,WFC,"Treasury yields jumped Tuesday morning with a solid retail sales report, but the rout for both bonds and stocks gathered steam. The 10-year Treasury yield vaulted to 3.09%, the highest since 2011, while the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%-0.8%. Yet better economic growth should mean better earnings, so why did stock investors join in the sell-off?Here are 4 reasons why the market reaction raises concern about the outlook for stock investors:First, the obvious: Higher rates are a negative for interest-rate sensitive stocks, notably housing and autos. Big homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) were among the biggest losers on the S&P 500 on Tuesday.Next, the Fed: The rise in 2-year Treasury yields came as markets began to price in more-hawkish Fed policy. Now markets see a roughly 55% chance of a fourth 2018 Fed rate hike coming in December, up from less than 40% odds a month ago. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Tuesday that he sees three or four rate hikes in 2018 as the ""right direction.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Tuesday, 10-year Treasury yields rose even more than 2-year yields, steepening the slope of the yield curve. That's good for bank net interest margins and explains why Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) bucked the stock market downtrend and rose modestly on the stock market today.But, in general, banks have lagged the broader market in recent months as the yield curve has been getting flatter. The flat yield curve seems to reflect concerns that the Fed will overreact to strong growth fueled by a surge in federal tax-cut and spending stimulus this year. The Fed is seen as setting policy too tight once fiscal stimulus starts to wane, setting the economy up for a letdown in the second half of 2019.Third, rising U.S. interest rates have been accompanied by an upsurge in the value of the dollar vs. other major currencies. The U.S. dollar index rose about 0.5% on Tuesday, hitting a new high for 2018. The greenback is up about 5% from February lows. That's a pretty big negative for U.S. multinationals that derive much of their sales overseas, because those foreign sales are now worth less in dollar terms.A strengthening dollar is also a negative for the global economy because emerging-market economies often borrow in dollars. As the dollar rises relative to their home currencies, servicing dollar-denominated debt becomes more difficult. A higher dollar has added to Argentina's mounting problems.Fourth, higher U.S. interest rates are sapping demand for overseas debt at a time when U.S. borrowing needs are surging due to spiraling deficits and the Federal Reserve's unwinding of financial-crisis-era bond purchases. On Tuesday, bond yields rose across the world, not just in the U.S., which also crimps growths.The bottom line: Higher U.S. interest rates are tightening financial conditions around the world, a negative for earnings prospects at home and abroad.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurveBond Markets Send These 2 Gloomy Signals On Fed Rate HikesThese 5 Top Stocks Falter After Their Breakouts Lacked ThisTrump Gave Up His Best Leverage In China Trade Talks — For Beans?

35,WFC,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose a faster-than-expected 0.3% in January and 1.8% from a year ago, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, raising the odds of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.X The overall consumer price index rose 0.5% on the month and 2.1% from a year ago, amid higher energy prices.Food at home prices rose 0.1% on the month as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to inject even more intensive competition into the grocery business since closing its acquisition of Whole Foods last summer.Wall Street expected the core CPI to rise 0.2% on the month and 1.7% from a year ago. The consensus called for a 0.3% monthly and 2.0% annual rise in the broad CPI.After the report, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite reversed from solid gains to down more than 1% at one point. The major averages fell modestly at the open but the Nasdaq led an upside reversal.Menawhile, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.88%, back at four-year highs. The odds of a Fed rate hike at the March meeting rose to 83.1% at CME Group's FedWatch Tool, up from 76.1% on Tuesday. There's now a 24.2% chance of four or more rate hikes in 2018, up from 17% on Tuesday.Separately, retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.3% in January and were flat excluding autos.The CPI report had been as a potential market mover as investors are suddenly nervous about the prospect of faster wage growth, rising inflation and a more aggressive Federal Reserve.The upside surprise in core prices came as prices for medical services rose 0.6% in month, coming after minimal increases over the past year that left the annual rise at 2.0%. Prices for transportation services rose 0.8% on the month and 4.0% on the year. Meanwhile, apparel prices jumped 1.7%, even as the annual trend remained down 0.7%IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — when the Dow Jones industrial average was still within 2% of its record high — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when will make sense to get aggressive again.Thanks to a just-arriving fiscal boost from tax cuts and more stimulus coming from last week's $320 billion deficit-hiking spending deal, the balance of economic risks has shifted to the upside. JPMorgan economists are now expecting the jobless rate to fall to 3.2% by the end of 2019, and they think the Fed could raise rates eight times by then.After January's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, after being stuck around 2.5% for most of 2017, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear.Wage growth is seen a prelude to higher inflation, and there is reason to expect better wage gains, even if the wage acceleration that showed up in January's employment report was a misleading product of a shorter workweek.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. Last week, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes at least loosely to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics and the need to boost productivity help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.If companies don't have the luxury of raising prices to offset higher wages, pay hikes stand to cut into profits, which is among the reasons that CVS shares traded lower after announcing wage increases.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

36,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS) said Wednesday it's evaluating whether to enter the cryptocurrency frenzy after fourth-quarter results beat forecasts despite continued weakness in its trading operations, which underperformed vs. other big banks.X Last month, when Bitcoin was double what it is today, Bloomberg reported that Goldman was setting up a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies.On Wednesday, CFO Martin Chavez did not say whether a trading operation was in the cards, but he warned is approaching the volatile market with ""extreme prudence and caution.""""There's just a huge number of topics to address,"" he told analysts. ""And being a part of the industry, we're working on all of that. Custody is a part of it, and it's a very complex one, so it's really too early to say how that will evolve for the industry or for ourselves.""At Bank of America (BAC), which also reported Wednesday, CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts that customers are welcome to buy cryptocurrencies but not through the bank's Merrill Lynch unit, adding ""it's just our view that customers should be careful here.""The caution follows warnings from the Treasury Department, which has said it is following cryptocurrencies closely due to their use in criminal activity, while Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said last week Bitcoin could become the next ""Swiss Bank account.""Meanwhile, Goldman's Q4 adjusted EPS unexpectedly rose, climbing 11.8% to $5.68, beating views for a dip to $4.90. Revenue fell 4% to $7.83 billion, topping estimates for $7.63 billion.But fixed income, currency and commodities trading revenue sank 50% to $1 billion, and equities revenue fell 14% to $1.37 billion. Investment banking revenue jumped 44% to $2.14 billion, investing and lending revenue climbed 12% to $1.66 billion, and investment management revenue rose 4% to $1.66 billion.The drop in FICC revenue was steeper than at other big banks in Q4. JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) tumbled 34% to $2.22 billion, and Citigroup's (C) sank 18% to $2.4 billion. Bank of America's dropped 13%.BofA's EPS rose 17.5% to 47 cents, beating by 3 cents, as revenue grew 2.2% to $20.44 billion, missing views for $21.28 billion. Consumer banking revenue grew 10% to $9 billion, wealth management climbed 7% to $4.7 billion, global banking grew 10% to $5 billion, while sales and trading revenue sank 9% to $2.5 billion.Goldman shares lost 1.9% to 253.65 on the stock market today, still in buy range and finding support at the 50-day line But the stock's relative strength line hit a four-month low. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been flat to lagging for the past year.Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS), which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, gained 1.4%. BofA eased 0.2%, still well extended from any possible buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Wall Street has looked at what the banks expect to gain from the GOP's tax reform package. Bank of America, among the most U.S.-exposed big banks, could be among the bigger gainers from the legislation.Goldman's Chavez said the company expected an effective tax rate of 24% due to the tax reform, adding that there was greater potential for heightened M&A, more financing and stronger economic growth.The law, he said, had brought ""significant clarity"" to corporations, resulting in more dialog with clients in investment banking.Last week, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the company would deepen its investments in such areas as digital capabilities, offices and bankers. The company also said it expected tax reform to boost profits at small businesses and spending in the commercial space.CEO Jamie Dimon said that much of the benefit from tax reform would ""fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Fierce Bitcoin Critic Now Has 'Regret'; Kodak Joins Blockchain WaveEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

38,WFC,"The Fed hiked its key interest rate on Wednesday, surprising no one, while signaling no rush to step up its gradual pace of monetary tightening this year. The S&P 500 index and other major averages, after initially extending modest pre-announcement gains, then weakened as Jerome Powell held his first post-meeting news conference as Federal Reserve chairman.The initial market focus was on the Fed's near-term policy trajectory, but the takeaway may not be quite so positive once investors digest the more hawkish long-term outlook which hints at concern that there's greater risk of the economy overheating.As in December, the quarterly economic projections reflecting the individual views of each Federal Reserve policymaker pointed to a likelihood of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018, not four, as Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms anticipate. But the Fed did step up its rate-hike outlook for 2019.Fed policymakers now expect three quarter-point rate hikes in 2019, up from two in December, as the jobless rate falls to 3.6% in 2019 and core inflation rises to 2.1%, just above the Fed's target.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed's patience could give stocks a bit of running room as policymakers await evidence that faster economic growth, fueled by the big Trump tax cut and spending increases that have yet to hit, will boost wage growth and inflation.Powell said that if the Fed hikes too fast, ""inflation doesn't get up to 2%.""The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially extended moderate gains following the 2 p.m. ET policy statement. But after Powell began speaking at 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq  led the averages into negative territory in the stock market today. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq lost 0.3%. However, the small-cap Russell 2000 managed to climb 0.6%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones remain below their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq recently found support at that key level. Bank stocks were among the gainers after the Fed meeting, thanks to signals that policymakers are willing to let the economy run at least a little hotter.The 10-year Treasury yield initially slipped after the announcement, then turned higher to about 2.92%, before backtracking as stocks weakened. The yield is not too far off the key 3% threshold that hasn't been breached in more than four years.If there's one reason why stocks turned lower as Powell spoke, it could be because of his discussion of the significance of the Fed, for the first time, expecting above-target core inflation of 2.1%. The forecast raises the question of whether the Fed may really think of the 2% inflation target as symmetric — meaning that the current undershoot should be balanced out by a future overshoot.Yet Powell, in his press conference, said policymakers will aim to avoid any ""sustained or persistent deviations.""""We're always going to be seeking 2%.""Investors probably shouldn't be too reassured by a largely status-quo announcement on 2018 policy from the Fed. There's good reason to expect policymakers to step up their expectations to four 2018 Fed rate hikes by June — even if inflation remains tame.Once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will likely adjust rate-hike expectations upward.The Fed's most influential dove, Lael Brainard, in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Brainard echoed new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well-capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019, which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending. That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other bank stocks, which can benefit from higher short-term rates, especially when long-term interest rates rise even more, were only slightly higher before the Fed meeting statement on Wednesday, though JPMorgan Chase saw healthier gains. Bank of America and JPMorgan rose a little more after the announcement.Even though the 10-year yield was slightly lower, the 2-year yield fell a little more. A wider yield spread is good for bank profits.E-brokers are among financial stocks that benefit from a higher Fed interest rate, in part because  floating-rate margin loans for trading accounts are based on short-term rates that move in tandem with Fed policy. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) CFO Stephen Boyle said on the Jan. 23 earnings call that the next 25-basis-point increase to the Fed's target rate could yield an estimated $60 million to $110 million in pretax income. Shares of Ameritrade were up slightly ahead of the Fed announcement and rose a little more later.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump's China Trade War Could Start To Get Real ThursdayForget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

39,WFC,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Check Out These 4 Dow Jones Stocks; One Is Near A Buy PointBoeing, GE, United Tech Fall As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll InHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

40,WFC,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating. Yet a hawkish shift by the data-dependent Federal Reserve will continue to remain a risk for investors with every wage and inflation report. The consumer price index coming out on Wednesday is the next one to watch. UniCredit Research expects the core CPI, excluding food and energy, to rise 2% from a year ago vs. 1.8% in February.Following the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially moved higher, then relapsed in late morning trade on the stock market today. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all down 1% or more.Before the report, stock market futures were deep in the red in reaction to President Trump's threat to strike back at China even harder, with tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour.

But investors sold shares on concerns that Powell and fellow policymakers will raise interest rates more than three times in 2018 due to stepped-up economic growth forecasts.Asked whether low interest rates have fueled ""dangerous risk-taking,"" Powell noted no real build-up of leverage among households or the emergence of other significant risks to financial stability.Wall Street reacted somewhat negatively to Powell's first monetary policy testimony to Congress since taking the helm of the U.S. central bank, focusing on his outlook for stronger economic growth and what that might mean for the number of Fed rate hikes in 2018.Yet the overall tenor of his testimony probably should be taken as positive, because it suggests a lack of urgency to raise interest rates. The Fed, in other words, remains data-dependent and won't move to tighten policy more quickly due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus unless inflation gathers momentum. On the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at session lows, down more than 1%.Bank stocks fell somewhat amid the broad sell-off. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost a fraction, though JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were down 1% or more. Banks can reap higher net interest margins as interest rates rise, especially when the long-term yields rise more than short-term yields.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.90%, off session peaks but not far off last week's four-year high of 2.95%.""At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018,"" Powell said in response to a question over what it would take for the Fed to hike rates more than three times this year. ""Now since then — we will submit another projection, all of us, in three weeks  — but since then, what we've seen is incoming data that suggests that strengthening in the economy. We've seen continuing strength in the labor market. We've seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target. We've also seen continued strength around the globe, and we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate paths as we go into the March meeting.""Powell added that it was his ""personal outlook"" as well as the overall committee that ""the economy has strengthened since December,"" when Fed policymakers last offered their economic and policy projections for 2018.Powell's upgrading of the outlook is hardly a surprise, coming after Congress backed a $300-billion-plus increase in federal spending earlier in February. Even before that, some Fed policymakers had been marking up their economic projections, as noted in the minutes from their Jan. 30-31 meeting.Asked about whether ""profligate fiscal policy"" might require higher interest rates than otherwise by a Democratic committee member, Powell said that the Fed will keep its on eye on the economy, not on the actions of Congress, but he allowed that ""all things equal,"" the appropriate interest rate would be higher when fiscal policy becomes more stimulative.The Q&A seemed to cancel out the seemingly positive reaction to his published testimony. In prepared remarks released before the market open, Powell said that the Fed policymaking committee sees the risks to the economy as balanced between upside and downside risks, even as ""some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,"" especially fiscal policy.The takeaway from the Q&A is that the assessment of balanced risks might date back to the January meeting, before the latest fiscal stimulus.Yet in discussing a possibility that the Fed might discuss adopting an inflation range, instead of its specific 2% target, as a guide for policy, Powell underscored that there's not much reason to worry about an upsurge in inflation.""Generally speaking inflation has been low or stable for 15 years now,"" Powell said.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Indeed, core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures price index, hasn't touched 2.5% since 1995. The past two economic expansions weren't tripped up by the Fed having to tamp down an inflation outbreak, but by the bursting of the dot-com and housing bubbles.So when Powell expresses confidence that few troubling signs of excess have emerged, as well as confidence about a stable inflation outlook, investors should see the potential for this economic expansion running for several more years.In prepared testimony, Powell said, ""In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis.""Powell's testimony comes as firms including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are predicting one more rate hike this year than the Fed's own policymakers projected in December. Passage of a $310 billion budget deal in early February, after the Fed's last meeting, also has led economists to mark up their GDP growth estimates and added to concerns that inflation could make a comeback.Inflation and the risk of a hawkish Fed has come back on the radar of investors after the January jobs report showed average hourly wages growing 2.9% from a year ago, up from the Goldilocks readings near 2.5% that persisted in 2017.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, saying they would spend part of their tax windfall on higher compensation, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Although a faster pace of rate hikes can't be ruled out if wage gains and inflation exhibit momentum, Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed isn't predisposed to a faster pace of rate hikes and will continue to give the economy some running room.Arguably, financial markets are leading the Fed and not the other way around. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a four-year high last week after the Fed minutes from the January meeting noted that ""a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

44,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CFO Marianne Lake said on Friday that it was still too early to gauge whether President Trump's tax law would bring more loan growth, even though the bank remains upbeat on the law's potential impact eventually.Meanwhile, the tax cuts are boosting the bank's earnings, which topped first-quarter forecasts, along with Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Lake's remarks, made during a call with reporters, followed analyst worries that loan growth would be weak during the quarter. But during a call later in the morning with analysts, she said the tax legislation, which Trump signed into law in December, was ""a tailwind for credit overall.""And in Q1, JPMorgan's average core loan growth, excluding corporate and investment banking, rose 8%.The bank earned $2.37 a share on revenue of $28.52 billion, beating Zacks estimates for EPS of $2.28 and revenue of $27.745 billion.

45,WFC,"That $320 billion, two-year budget deal signed by President Trump on Friday will speed up economic growth and push the jobless rate to 3.2% by the end of 2019, an updated forecast from JPMorgan estimates. That's the kind of fiscal jolt that could keep stock markets jittery for an extended period.X By the end of next year, JPMorgan Chase economists expect the Federal Reserve to hike its key interest rate a whopping eight times — three more than Fed policymakers projected in December. As far as unemployment, Fed projections see it stabilizing at 3.9% next year vs. the current 4.1%JPMorgan's Fed forecast is an outlier, at least for now, but it highlights why stock markets have entered a new phase that may not quickly be left in the rearview mirror.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply on Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. That triggered a move to a stock market correction. On Friday, the major averages tumbled on the stock market today until the S&P 500 briefly undercut its 200-day moving average. That trigger a sharp rebound, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closing up 1.4%-1.5%.Bond and stock markets are suddenly concerned that interest rates will vault higher as the Fed gradually reverses government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, Treasury issuance balloons to fund the return of trillion-dollar deficits, and the economy shifts into overdrive. It's no help that the deficit outlook will continue to worsen, with $2 trillion annual deficits on their way within a decade.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our weekly cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.On Friday, Moody's said that the ""pre-eminent"" financial and economic position of the U.S. will preserve its triple-A credit. But Moody hinted that its deteriorating fiscal position could jeopardize the U.S. rating amid evidence of ""declining growth potential, coupled with emerging aversion to open trade and foreign labor.""One interesting aspect of JPMorgan's forecast is that even after the bank's economists boosted their forecast of GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point this year to reflect the budget deal, they're still expecting less-than-stellar 2.6% growth this year. In 2019, they see the budget deal lifting growth by 0.3 percentage point above their earlier forecast, but still only to 2.2%.In other words, they suspect that the economy may not have to grow all that fast to generate the kind of wage and inflationary pressures which haven't been seen since before the last recession and which most financial market participants seemed to think were history.It's possible that JPMorgan will be proved wrong by faster productivity growth and labor force growth than it expects. Yet the bank's forecast highlights why Wall Street may no longer be comfortable counting on benign economic outcomes.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the latest budget deal, the balance of economic risks has pretty clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air.

49,WFC,"China will open up its massive electronic-payments market to foreign companies, a move that would pit newcomers against licensed, already established firms in the nation such as Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat Pay and Alibaba (BABA)-backed Ant Financial's Alipay.XCompanies that apply for a payments license in China will need to store the information they collect within the nation's borders. Those firms will also need to establish a commercial presence in China, payment service facilities and disaster-recovery systems.The decision, the People's Bank of China said on Wednesday, was intended to encourage innovation and competition. But it also comes as President Trump, who has long complained that China has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade, readies a plan to hit the country with at least $30 billion in tariffs.The loosening of the payments market comes after Beijing last year eased rules for foreign banks to do business in China, potentially allowing U.S. giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) to increase their presence in retail banking and financial services.JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also among the more than 30 U.S. banks that are in a consortium for mobile payment service Zelle, which transferred $75 billion through 247 million transactions in 2017.PayPal (PYPL), which owns Venmo, already has ties in China.

50,WFC,"A Federal Reserve rate hike on Wednesday is a near certainty, so the focus will be on Fed policymakers' projections of future policy, especially whether they see a fourth hike in the cards in 2018.If Fed members don't step up their expectation for three quarter-point hikes on Wednesday, they're very likely to by June — even if inflation remains tame.The Fed's most influential dove in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely-seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBrainard echoed new Fed Chair Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Yet once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will adjust rate-hike expectations upward, if they don't do so on Wednesday.Stocks overall have paused in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average all falling more than 1% Monday as Facebook (FB) triggered selling. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are both below their 50-day moving averages. But the major averages have rallied sharply over the last several years. The major averages rose modestly on Tuesday.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019 which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending.

53,WFC,"A steepening stock market sell-off made for a tough first day of work for Jerome Powell, officially sworn in as the chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, as markets sliced lower in a continuation of Friday's heavy distribution.X The Dow Jones industrial average faltered 4.6%, down almost 1,200 points for its largest-ever point loss, with all but three of its stocks posting losses greater than 2%.The S&P 500 unraveled 4.1%, with Wells Fargo (WFC) posting the index's worst decline,  down almost 10%,  as investors reacted to penalties imposed by the Federal Reserve on Friday.

Tesla sold off after in-line results and an out-of-this world publicity stunt.X With the major averages and many leading stocks tumbling, intensifying losses from the prior week's big losses, the stock market moved from uptrend under pressure to an outright correction. Chips, energy and China names were among the big losers, but the stock market retreat was broad and deep. Stocks did stage a nice rebound from the S&P 500's test of the 200-day moving average, but it takes more than one good day to snap a downtgrend.

59,WFC,"Just about the last thing the stock market needed as it tries to recover from the Dow Jones industrial average's 4.6% plunge to start the week was a $300 billion deficit-boosting budget deal.X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. By the close on the stock market today, the Dow sank 4.15%, the S&P 500 3.75% and the Nasdaq 3.9%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Yet the renewed weakness in the stock market only dragged the 10-year Treasury yield moderately lower to 2.83%.The S&P 500 and other major averages had already reversed lower Wednesday in part as the increased spending agreement took hold, lifting yields.The trading action makes it look as if the stock market isn't just climbing a wall of worry, it's climbing a wall of debt, and that wall just got steeper. Already, Wall Street had been expecting $1 trillion in Treasury issuance in 2018, nearly double last year's total. Now, the deal to boost spending on defense and domestic programs, while sending more money to hurricane-hit regions, could raise that total by $150 billion or more, with no letup in years to come.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The heavier load of Treasury debt that needs to be issued to fund widening deficits comes as the Federal Reserve has begun gradually reversing government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis. The rise in Treasury yields needed to clear all of the new supply is generally seen as a negative for stocks, because higher interest rates can curb borrowing appetites and make stocks look like less of a bargain.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the Senate budget deal that got a stamp of approval from House Speaker Paul Ryan, markets have reason to double down on those concerns. Whether or not Fed policymakers come right out and say it when they next meet in March, and New York Fed President William Dudley's comments on Thursday suggest they probably will,  the balance of economic risks has now clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the monthly employment report suggested the concern about accelerating wage gains was premature, it does appear that faster wage growth is coming. Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies credited the tax cuts for their decision, though the competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation has appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

60,WFC,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed 3.2 points to 10-month high of 55.1 in January as tax cuts and record highs on Wall Street buoyed Americans' views of their personal financial outlook to a 14-year high.X Outside of three months early in 2017, when expectations were running high for what President Trump could accomplish with a GOP Congress, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index hit its highest level since November 2006.The Economic Optimism Index is now in solidly optimistic territory (readings of 50 are neutral) and just over a point off the decade high of 56.3 in February 2017.The poll, which included 901 responses from Jan. 2 to Jan. 10, was conducted after Trump signed tax legislation and amid reports that multiple banks including Wells Fargo (WFC) were boosting their minimum wage to $15 an hour and other major employers including AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) announced $1,000 bonuses for their workers.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months, and views of how well government economic policies are working.The gauge of the six-month economic outlook vaulted 5.7 points to 55.5 after slipping into mildly pessimistic territory in December.The six-month personal financial outlook index jumped 4.9 points to 64.0, the highest since January 2004.Meanwhile, the measure of confidence in federal economic policies slipped 1 point to 45.7.In short, Americans feel really positive about their financial prospects, they feel good about the economic outlook, but they're even more unhappy about government than they were before the tax cuts.Looking below the surface, Republicans feel better about federal policies — a sky-high 76.0 reading — than at any time since the month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Democrats, on the other hand, have rarely felt worse about government policies, reflected by a 25.7 reading. Independents are moderately negative at 42.5, down from 45.8 in December.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Here Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buy Points; Why This One Stands OutHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The Fed issued the news release at 6:15 p.m. Friday, well after the market's close.The Fed's action stunned the Street. Stock indexes dropped about 4% Monday. Some analysts called the action unprecedented. Friday was outgoing Fed chair Janet Yellen's last day and she made it memorable.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The market pullback was already underway before Yellen's move. However, it clearly sharpened the losses, especially among the big money-center banks.Meanwhile, the Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the IBD 50, turned up 0.4%. The ETF fell 3.5% early Tuesday, after dropping almost to its 200-day line. It was the first brush with the 200-day line for Innovator IBD 50 since November 2016.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index provided the day's bright spot.

64,WFC,"Blue chips overcame resistance at a key line with an hour of trade left in Monday's session. The U.S. stock indexes were on track for their third straight gain.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.4%, becoming the last of the major indexes to cross above its 50-day line. The line had been acting as resistance for more than two weeks and could now become support.The 50-day line often acts as a test area. When either a stock or an index trade above the line, the 50-day can act as a test for support. When the price is below the line, the 50-day can act as resistance.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.7%.

65,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) lead the biggest U.S. banks into another round of earnings on Friday, amid expectations for big profit gains.But some analysts have questions about how the GOP's tax cuts and proposed changes to the Fed's annual stress tests might affect shareholder buybacks and dividends.JPMorgan Chase is seen reporting a 38% jump in earnings per share to $2.28, with revenue up 12% to $27.53 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Citigroup is expected to put a 19% gain in EPS to $1.62. Revenue is seen increasing 4% to $18.9 billion. Wells Fargo's EPS is seen up 7% to $1.07 on revenue of $21.68 billion, down 1%.Lower taxes and Fed rate hikes, which squeeze up rates on things like credit cards and auto loans, should help profits. Trading should be better, led by equities, after inflation fears in February and trade-war fears since then, have brought steeper swings in market activity.But that volatility could mean weaker investment banking results, Nomura-Instinet analysts said, as companies grew more cautious on deal-making. Analysts there also cited ""tepid"" loan growth for the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks' Relative Strength lines, which measure a stock's performance against the S&P 500, have also flattened recently.Even as banks enjoy a stronger economy, the Federal Reserve this week proposed new changes to its annual stress tests, which assess whether big banks could keep lending in an economic crisis. Those proposed changes could be a mixed bag for the banks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed intended to simplify capital rules for large banks. The proposals would cut the number of capital requirements banks have to meet, and make it easier for banks to hike shareholder payouts by eliminating ""quantitative"" objections to banks' hypothetical capital levels under economic stress.However, the Fed's proposal would require banks adhere to the capital levels dictated by a ""stress capital buffer,"" which would ""produce capital requirements for large banking organization that are firm-specific and risk-sensitive,"" the central bank said. The size of the stress capital buffer would be determined by the stress test results and would be ""part of the firm's ongoing capital requirements,"" possibly restricting shareholder rewards if a bank's capital came up short.Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak also noted that the GOP's tax legislation places restrictions on banks' usage of net operating losses during the Fed's exams to boost their capital levels.He said that ""1Q earnings strength could be overwhelmed by disappointing CCAR guidance,"" referring to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, one of the Fed's stress tests.Shares of JPMorgan closed down 1.7% at 110.62 in the stock market today, working on a 119.43 buy point but are still trying to regain their 50-day line, a key metric of support.Citigroup dipped 0.9% to 69.89, stuck below both its 50- and 200-day lines, and Wells Fargo fell 1.3% to 51.93, also mired below those levels of support.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Banks And Financial Stock NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

But two emerging markets ETFs outperformed.SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) and iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) each saw year-to-date gains of 7.6% through Jan. 30, according to Morningstar Direct, ahead of the S&P 500 index's 5.7% return. They also topped the benchmark index last year. Over the longer haul, however, they lagged the S&P 500.Most of the other names on the list, composed primarily of U.S. equity funds, have performed more in line with the broader market over the past three and five years. WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend (DFJ) and WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE), the two non-U.S. focused ETFs, have also performed largely in line with the S&P 500 for those periods.EDIV, which has attracted $484.8 million since its February 2011 launch, tracks the S&P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index. South Africa made up its biggest country weight as of Feb. 1, at nearly 26% of assets. Taiwan was next at 21%, Thailand 16%, China 15% and Malaysia 7%.DVYE, launched in February 2012, has $456.4 million in assets and tracks the Dow Jones Emerging Markets Select Dividend Index. Taiwan represented its largest country weighting at 25.5% of assets, followed by 14% in China, 12% each in the Russia Federation and Thailand, 8% in Brazil and 7% in South Africa.The two emerging markets plays were also among the top dividend payers. EDIV offered an annualized yield of 3% and DVYE paid 4.8%, well above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) came in third with a YTD return of 5.4%. The $2.2 billion fund, which tracks the index with the same name, will turn five in May. Information technology accounted for the biggest sector weight at 20% of assets, industrials 19%, health care 17%, consumer discretionary 12% and consumer staples 11%.The top five holdings as of Feb. 1 were Exxon Mobil (XOM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wells Fargo (WFC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). They made up 22% of the portfolio. Exxon had a bad day Friday; shares slid 5% after the oil giant's earnings report.

That earnings figure excludes a $2.4 billion negative impact from the Trump tax cuts.  JPMorgan sees a 19% effective tax rate in 2018.Fixed income, credit and currency trading revenue tumbled 34% to $2.22 billion. Consumer and business banking revenue rose 16% to $5.6 billion. Commercial banking revenue grew 20% to $2.4 billion. Asset and wealth management revenue increased 9% to $3.4 billion.Stock: Shares of the Dow component climbed 1.65% to 112.67 on the stock market today. Shares were within range of a 108.50 buy point of a 3-weeks trading pattern.

The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Analysts hadn't exactly been expecting blowout earnings from the banks this month, as many financial institutions absorb short-term, but heavy, hits to their profits due to the tax reform.Goldman Sachs (GS), has forecast a $5 billion dent to earnings, much of it due to the repatriation tax. Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America and Citigroup have said they would take big charges from writing down so-called deferred tax assets, which companies can use to ease their tax burden in the event of a loss.Still, tax reform is largely expected to benefit the banks longer term. Analysts have said the legislation would likely be a bigger theme this earnings season than the results themselves, as Wall Street tries to assess the full benefits of the bill.Financials also have been rallying in 2018 on higher bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury rate moving past 2.5% this week. Higher yields, including a wider spread between short- and long-term maturities, should bolster banks' profitability in traditional lending.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Blackrock Earnings Rise 21% As Assets Under Management SwellBanks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

70,WFC,"Thursday may be remembered as one of the low points of Donald Trump's presidency because of his widely denounced immigration remarks, but it could have been a banner day, with the announcement by Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) that it will move production of its Ram heavy-duty pickup from Mexico to Michigan.X Financial markets were thrown for a modest loop Wednesday afternoon when reports emerged that Canada now expects President Trump to put into motion the U.S. withdrawal from Nafta, possibly in the next few weeks. Shares of General Motors (GM) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) were among those sliding on the speculation. Yet Fiat Chrysler's news is among the recent developments that now make a near-term Nafta exit all but unthinkable.Here are five reasons why it is extremely unlikely that Trump will move to pull out of the 1994 trade agreement:Trump's strategy to boost American manufacturing always has involved both carrots and sticks. Now that he's got his carrots passed into law with a 21% corporate tax rate, making the U.S. a more attractive location to produce goods, the urgency of applying punitive tariffs has abated. Fiat Chrysler's move gives Trump tangible results to prove that his policies are making a difference in the Rust Belt.To the extent that Steve Bannon's worldview still held influence in the Oval Office after his dismissal in August, that abruptly ended with the release of Michael Wolff's best-seller in which Trump's one-time campaign manager lobbed bombs at the president's children. Now Trump seems to be virtually alone, both in the White House and in the Republican Party, in his belief that the U.S. should walk away from Nafta.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.It may not be an overstatement to say that Trump is bracing for a war to preserve his presidency. Trump's comments this week raising doubt about whether he would submit to an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller underscore the possibility that the midterm elections could be a matter of political life and death for Trump. Even if no proof of collusion emerges, Democrats could seize on Trump's unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation to impeach him for obstructing justice. While a two-thirds vote in the Senate is needed for conviction, Trump's priority No. 1 is keeping the House in Republican hands, and when you're in a war, you don't go looking for unnecessary battles.Most economists expect a fairly modest boost to growth from the tax cuts this year, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists forecasting a 0.3-percentage-point rise in GDP. While it's possible that those estimates are too conservative, as companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Wal-Mart (WMT) respond by hiking their minimum wage, the economy is the best thing that the GOP has going for it in an election year. Trump won't want to disrupt the positive trends by spreading uncertainty at a time when businesses have new incentives to invest in growth.Amid growing odds of a potentially prolonged government shutdown over the status of so-called Dreamers, an announced plan to leave Nafta could offset much of the good economic news.Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, disavowed the Iran nuclear deal, and ordered the wind-down of the deferred action program for Dreamers, so what makes Nafta different? In those first three cases, Trump moved when he faced deadlines to either break with existing policy or actively carry out President Obama's programs. In the case of DACA, for example, the Trump administration had to decide whether to defend Obama's executive action in court. Nafta is different: There's no deadline for making a decision — unless Trump starts the six-month clock for withdrawal — and the current uncertainty he's created about Mexico's status as a preferred U.S. trading partner is probably sufficient to influence business decisions like Fiat Chrysler's.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitApple And Wal-Mart Are Just Below Buy Points, But Be WaryHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

76,WFC,"""Messy and lackluster,"" Jefferies says. ""Isn't great,"" according to Nomura-Instinet. ""Noise,"" says Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Those are words being used to describe big banks' fourth-quarter earnings season, which starts Friday, with results due from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).The good news, perhaps, is that Wall Street might not care that much.X After a year dogged by lackluster trading activity, flattening yield curves and occasional concerns about loan growth, business confidence and long-term rates, the financial community seems likelier to be more interested in the longer-term benefits from the tax reform signed into law last month and trends for the year ahead.""While results may underwhelm some investors, we believe the bigger story for 4Q will be tax guidance,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak wrote in a research note last week, adding that management should offer more detail on future tax rates and more obscure parts of the tax bill.The more U.S.-exposed banks — such as Bank of America (BAC), which reports on Jan. 17, and JPMorgan — are likely to get the biggest bounce to earnings, he said.As for the fourth quarter: Trading? That'll be bad, again, compared to last year, when the markets' gears were still grinding away to process President Trump's election. Loan growth, particularly in commercial and industrial lending? Could be better, due to seasonal factors, KBW says. But one-time charges related to Trump's new tax legislation will soak the banks' profits during the quarter.JPMorgan is seen reporting earnings per share of $1.69, down 1%. Revenue is seen up 7% to $24.99 billion.Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO, has been a longtime evangelist for tax reform and deregulation. Over the summer, Dimon said it was ""almost an embarrassment, being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country.""Wells Fargo, which is also likely to be a big gainer from tax reform as it tries to repair its reputation after a fake-account scandal, is expected to report EPS up 1% to $1.04. Revenue is expected to come in at $22.43 billion, a 4% increase.PNC Financial (PNC), which also reports Friday, is seen growing EPS by 12% to $2.20, as revenue grows 8% to $4.17 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.As the industry looks out to the year ahead, analysts generally think 2018 will be a better year for the banks. But they remain mixed over where, and when, the benefits will land.Among the benefits to expect, Chubak cites rate hikes from the Fed — which would bump up rates on things like credit cards and auto loans, and healthier deal making amid more clarity over tax policy. But weak fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading could extend into this year.While business-loan growth might be stronger in Q4, it could be muted in the first half of the year, as ""companies are expected to slow borrowing until all the ramifications of the tax bill are sorted out,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote.Goldman Sachs (GS) reports Q4 results next Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) reports next Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Fierce Bitcoin Critic Now Has 'Regret'; Kodak Joins Blockchain WaveBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetMorgan Stanley To Take $1.25 Billion Hit For U.S. Tax RevampGoldman Sachs Takes One-Time $5 Billion Hit From U.S. Tax Bill

78,WFC,"Just about everything (other than inflation) is lining up against investors in long-term Treasuries: stronger tax-cut-fueled growth; a Congress that is arguing over how much to hike spending; an unwinding of global central bank bond buying; and talks between North Korea and South Korea on easing military tensions. Add to that Wednesday's report that China is souring on purchases of U.S. government bonds.X All of these factors helped push the 10-year Treasury yield up as high as 2.59% on Wednesday, before easing to 2.55% amid speculation that the U.S. will pull out of Nafta. That's still not far below the four-year-high 2.63% touched in March.Yet, in one respect, markets may be underestimating upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields. While a number of Wall Street firms have said that a trillion-dollar deficit could return in fiscal 2019, the realization hasn't hit that annual deficits could approach $2 trillion, about 7% of GDP, by 2027.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rallied modestly early Thursday after retreating Wednesday but well off intraday lows. Bank stocks pushed higher in Wednesday's stock market trading, helped by prospects for wider net interest margins that would come from rising long-term rates without an equivalent rise in short-term Treasuries. Bank stocks edged higher early Thursday.Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) rose 1.4%, Bank of America (BAC) 0.9% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 1.1%.Meanwhile, homebuilder stocks sought to rebound after tumbling on the prospects for higher mortgage rates. Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) rose 1% after sinking 2.9% on Wednesday. D.R. Horton (DHI) gained 1.5% after Wednesday's 3.5% retreated. Lennar (LEN), which sailed past fourth-quarter revenue estimates Wednesday but missed earnings due to a tax-related shift, was an exception, climbing 2.4% Wednesday. Lennar rose 1.4% Thursday morning.Some analysts noted that Beijing's reported warning, which may be an effort to gain leverage in trade disputes with the U.S., may not be such a big deal because ""China has not been a big buyer of Treasuries for several years now,"" as Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Ward McCarthy wrote.Even before the Trump tax cuts passed, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting a $1.5 trillion deficit in 2027 as entitlement spending swells. How could that get as high as $2 trillion? The first step would be to extend individual tax cuts that are set to sunset after 2025, as the GOP vows to do. That could add about $150 billion to the 2027 deficit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Next, factor in behavioral changes that government scorekeepers didn't expect. Already California, New York and other blue states, whose upper-middle-class taxpayers could be hit by new limits on the deduction of state and local taxes, are trying to nail down ways to protect their residents from paying higher federal taxes. One idea is to allow individuals to make voluntary tax-protected contributions to state government, in lieu of tax payments. Limiting deductions was supposed to save $100 billion a year by 2025.Further, some analysts believe that the official score of the legislation underestimates the revenue loss from pass-through businesses, which account for the vast majority of enterprises, opting to incorporate to take advantage of the new 21% corporate tax rate or otherwise reorganize to minimize tax bills.Here's another coming shock: The Trump tax legislation was supposed to cut government health care spending by $53 billion in 2027 by repealing the individual mandate, but ObamaCare may end up costing substantially more — not less — due to Trump's policies. Despite repeal of the individual mandate and a sign-up period for HealthCare.gov that was half as long, the number of people signing up for coverage barely fell from a year ago, and the total could end up being higher once unpaid enrollment is winnowed out, because millions more were eligible for free ObamaCare bronze plans this year.Even still, most of the 4.5 million uninsured Americans who were eligible for free coverage likely didn't sign up because they didn't realize it or missed the sign-up window. The surge in free bronze plans is a result of President Trump's decision to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had long threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized an opening to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that made the government's cost of subsidies soar and turned the attempted sabotage into a life raft.If Democrats reclaim the White House, expect them to seize on the expansion of free health coverage under Trump with more intensive enrollment efforts, or else states could pursue auto-enrollment initiatives to enroll modest-income households in free plans, substantially boosting the federal government's cost.Putting everything together, as deficits widen from tax cuts that don't expire, state and individual behavioral shifts that further reduce tax revenues, and higher-than-expected ObamaCare costs, debt service costs will balloon as well.A  new projection is out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that the annual federal deficit will hit $2.1 trillion in 2027 on the current trajectory, including a fuller range of tax extensions, disaster relief, a lifting of annual spending limits known as the sequester and all the additional debt service.One near-term development that could stand in the way of deeper sell-off in long-term Treasuries is the prospect for a government shutdown. The likelihood of a shutdown seemed to dim late Tuesday, when a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to renew protections for Dreamers under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. While Trump is expected to challenge the dubious ruling in court, the issue may not be a barrier to keeping the government open for business beyond Jan. 19, when the most recent budget authorization expires. Still, Democratic leaders in Congress are talking about the reprieve as temporary and continue to tie a DACA fix to a longer government funding resolution.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax-Cut Windfall Mounts: Higher Pay, Lower Utility BillsThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buy Points; Why This One Stands OutHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

79,WFC,"The Federal Reserve late Thursday released annual stress-test guidelines that will test more big banks and pit the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) against a tougher economic obstacle course than last year.X But the new rules shouldn't affect the thing that Wall Street tends to care most about when the exam results come out in June; the buyback and dividend payouts that the banks typically announce after they pass the tests, an analyst said.The GOP's new tax legislation should be ""a beneficial offset"" in the Fed's annual evaluation of banks' abilities to lend to households and businesses if the economy implodes, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The banks' pre-provision net revenue — or revenue before factoring for the money set aside to cover losses — should also ""start at a higher point,"" he added.""In the end, our current expectations for capital return are not changing despite more severe stress scenarios,"" Kleinhanzl wrote.Each year, the Fed's stress tests lays out three economic scenarios, each with different degrees of severity, that the banks have to prove they have the capital cushion to navigate.The harshest scenario this year, what the Fed calls the ""severely adverse"" scenario, envisions a severe global recession, with U.S. unemployment rate rising by nearly 6 percentage points to 10% by the third quarter of next year. That rise is a bit more than the roughly 5.25 percentage-point increase, still to 10%, in last year's scenario.And by that time, under this year's scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared to 6.5% last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's tests outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Housing and commercial real estate prices would also slide. ""Severe recessions"" would trample the eurozone, the U.K. and Japan.Also, the severe test would include ""a global aversion to long-term fixed-income assets."" As a result, the Fed said, long-term rates would not fall and yield curves would steepen.The Fed said it's dialed up the bleakness in this year's tests because it wanted a ""test of the resilience of large firms when current economic conditions are especially strong.""JPMorgan shares were down 2.2% in the stock market today. Bank of America was off 1.7%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 4.5% and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 3.4%. Citigroup (C) eased 2.75% and Wells Fargo (WFC) lost 2.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The annual grading of the banks' resilience in a crisis features two parts. First, the Dodd-Frank Act stress test shows how banks' capital would hold up under the different economic scenarios. The second, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), evaluates the banks' capital planning procedures and capital adequacy, and looks at their plans for rewarding investors with dividends and buybacks.The banks have until April 5 to submit their capital plans to the Fed. Results will be announced by June 30.Last year, all 34 banks subject to the tests passed. And the banks have gotten used to the grading process. A flood of press releases from the banks, announcing dividends and buybacks, tends to follow once they pass the second and final round of the tests.This year, 38 banks total will be tested. The Fed for the first time will also test five foreign companies with U.S. operations.The Trump administration's tax reform has mangled the buyback plans of some of the companies subject to the tests this year. American Express (AXP) said it would suspend its buyback plans for the first half of the year due to a one-time hit to profits caused by the legislation.Capital One Financial (COF) also said it would cut its buyback offering nearly in half due to a similar charge.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Beat; Wells Fargo MixedGoldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags Peers

80,WFC,"The Trump tax cuts were met with bleak poll numbers and high skepticism among Americans about their tilt in favor of corporations and the highest-income groups. Yet barely two weeks after passage, roughly 1 million workers have been awarded bonuses that companies attribute to the GOP tax legislation, according to a running list by Americans for Tax Reform, and a few million more are in line to get small cuts in their utility bills.X Still others will benefit from bigger corporate matches for 401(k) accounts, as well as a new $15 minimum wage adopted by at least 20 banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services (PNC), in the wake of tax cuts.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000); Southwest Airlines (LUV) (55,000); and U.S. Bancorp (60,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.Meanwhile, a number of electric utilities have announced plans to cut power bills, sharing their tax-cut windfall. Customers of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Pacificorp and Exelon (EXC) subsidiaries Pepco, Baltimore Gas & Electric, and Commonwealth Edison stand to benefit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Even before the tax cuts begin to show up in paychecks in February, take-home pay has been surging at a rate that's almost unmatched since recession hit in 2007, the exception being a spurt that coincided with 2017's bonus season that runs through the end of March.Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld employment and income taxes have surged 7.4% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the roughly 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy, so bonuses and other incentive pay likely explain the surge to a large extent.The big political question is whether such displays of corporate generosity begin to shift sentiment about the Republicans' legislative achievement and improve GOP prospects in the midterm elections. From an economic standpoint, the question is how fast will the economy grow in 2018 and how much growth will result from this instant gratification from tax cuts.Most economists have fairly moderate expectations for growth this year, with JPMorgan Chase's economics team seeing 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, thanks to a 0.3-percentage-point lift from tax cuts. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that he thinks ""4% economic growth this year is possible.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

82,WFC,"The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.Wall Street economists expected a gain of 190,000 jobs and steady 4.1% jobless rate.X Average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63 an hour, up 2.5% from a year earlier. That was in line with the expected 2.5%, still the Goldilocks reading markets enjoyed throughout 2017.Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher after the jobs report, with the major indexes hitting record highs early Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped after the jobs and wage data that bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to go slow in hiking its key interest rate.The continuation of tepid average wage gains comes amid a recent surge in federal withheld employment and income taxes. Over the last couple of months, Americans' paychecks have been growing at nearly the best rate in a decade.The stronger tax receipts may reflect a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line.Meanwhile, a host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) have announced a $15 minimum wage since tax cuts passed. Wells Fargo is hiking its base wage from $13.50 an hour, but those won't show up until later this year.To help boost recruitment in a tight job market, Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October, with plans to get to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Target announced 100,000 seasonal hires, up from 70,000, while Amazon.com (AMZN) planned to add 120,000 seasonal jobs, same as a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: The surest way to keep from missing out if this bull market still has legs and to avoid piling up losses should a bear market take hold is to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market trend, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.For the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.Labor Department data showed that the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs in December. Nonstore retailers such as Amazon added just 200 jobs.The ADP employment report out Thursday indicated that 250,000 private-sector jobs were added in December. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP report, credited a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""October and November job gains were revised own by a combined 9,000, leaving the average monthly job gain at 204,000 over the past three months, the government said.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018.

Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point.

86,WFC,"As President Trump and the GOP celebrate their $1.5-trillion-tax-cut victory, Americans' paychecks are growing like they haven't for a decade.X The big question is whether this is a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line — or the start of a sustainable pickup for wage growth and the economy, and Friday's jobs data may start to provide some early hints.Wall Street expects another solid payroll reading — thought not as robust as Thursday's ADP report showing a 250,000 rise in private-sector payrolls — with 190,000 nonfarm jobs added in December and the unemployment rate holding at a 17-year-low of 4.1%. Still, forecasters expect Labor Department data to show that the tepid 2.5% annual gain in average hourly wages continued last month.Yet federal employment and income taxes withheld from worker paychecks are telling a merrier story. Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld taxes have surged 6.8% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy.A multitude of factors is likely contributing to the faster rise in aggregate pay. Faster wage growth, spurred by the tightening labor market, could be among them. Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October. A host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) announced a $15 minimum wage after tax cuts passed, but those didn't take effect in time for December's jump in tax receipts. Wells Fargo hiked its base wage from $13.50 an hour.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP employment report, attributed its strength to a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""Target's wage hike came as it was seeking to recruit 100,000 workers for the holidays. Meanwhile, for the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.A bigger Christmas bonus season is likely part of the story. After a year of huge stock gains and in anticipation of tax cuts in 2018, it wouldn't be surprising if bonuses were running ahead of the prior year's pace. The year-end bonus season runs through March 31, the deadline for deducting them from the prior year's pretax profits. And tax receipts spiked at the end of bonus season last March, briefly sending the growth in tax receipts to levels not seen since 2007.Now tax receipts are again breaking above the trend that has prevailed for a decade. Yet, given the individual and corporate tax cuts, the logical time for companies to pay bonuses will be early in 2018. That will allow corporations to deduct them against 2017 profits, when they'll face a higher tax rate, yet allow individuals to recognize the income in 2018, when they'll face a lower tax rate.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

87,WFC,"When Forbes recently reprinted its first list of the richest Americans, for its 100th Anniversary Issue, Jacob Schiff's name stood out as one that seems to be forgotten.That list for 1918, headed by John D. Rockefeller, consisted of well-known captains of industry or their heirs. Schiff was tied for 23rd with a net worth of $50 million (equivalent to $875 million today), alongside tobacco tycoon James Duke, photography pioneer George Eastman, Sears & Roebuck founder Julius Rosenwald, and Pierre S. Du Pont, who created the chemicals empire.Schiff was one of Wall Street's leading investment bankers from 1880 to 1920, with his Kuhn, Loeb & Co. enabling railroads to reach every corner of the continent, helping insurance companies grow, and lending Japan the money it needed to defeat Russia in their 1904-05 war (his revenge for the czar's pogroms against the Jews).""Many Jews were forced to flee Russia, and Schiff, an immigrant from Germany, helped encourage these and other immigrants to be proud of their heritage and fight bigotry and hatred,"" Jeffrey Podoshen, associate professor of marketing at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., told IBD. ""He was instrumental in instilling the beliefs that they had to depend on themselves and their own hard work to achieve success in the face of perpetual propaganda from racists and anti-Semites. Schiff was confident, bold, unapologetic, and very successful.""Schiff (1847-1920) was born in Frankfurt into a distinguished family that traced its lineage in the city back five centuries. His father was a broker for the Rothschilds and at 14 Schiff began working as an apprentice at a mercantile house and then a bank.At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Schiff, 18, decided the United States would provide greater opportunity and boarded a ship for New York City. After a few months of unemployment, he was hired as a clerk at a brokerage and within two years formed a partnership, Budge, Schiff & Co. In 1874, Abraham Kuhn of Kuhn, Loeb invited him to join the investment bank and Schiff contributed his valuable European connections. The following year, he married Theresa Loeb, daughter of co-founder Solomon, and they would have a son and daughter.""The partners had prospered in wholesale clothing in Cincinnati and during the Civil War because of the Union's demand for army blankets,"" wrote Naomi Cohen in ""Jacob H. Schiff: A Study in American Jewish Leadership."" ""In 1867, they established Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in New York, a banking firm that dealt primarily in government bonds. Jewish investment bankers ... created opportunities for Jews who, because of their Jewishness, were barred from gentile firms, collectively providing a base for cooperation in new investments. … Their kinship network that spanned two continents played a pivotal role in their achievements.""By 1875, the other partners were following Schiff's lead in aggressively pursuing new business, in contrast to the prior attitude that the respectable thing to do was to wait for proposals. Well before Schiff was made head of the firm in 1885, he was seen as the strategist and spokesman for Kuhn, Loeb and would remain so for over four decades.""The older members of the firm recognized his financial genius ... and Kuhn, Loeb became one of the two most influential private international banking houses in the Western Hemisphere,"" wrote Cyrus Adler in ""Jacob Henry Schiff: A Biographical Sketch."" ""It was characteristic of him as a banker that his activities were all creative, looking to the development of the resources and the extension of the commerce of the United States, particularly concerned in the financing of railway enterprises. … He was swift to recognize the genius of Edward H. Harriman, and the Harriman-Schiff railway combination became the most powerful, the most aggressive, and the most successful that America had ever known.""Kuhn, Loeb financed many railways, including providing the Pennsylvania Railroad with $500 million over a quarter century. By the mid-1880s, Schiff had a strong relationship with railroad baron James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad, giving Schiff a seat on the board, while Hill sent his son to be trained by the banker. But the economic panic of 1893 exposed corruption and inefficiencies in many railroads, and Schiff pressured Hill to consolidate Great Northern with his troubled client, Northern Pacific. Hill refused and turned to J.P. Morgan to fund his ambitions.""Schiff formed a reorganization committee for another client in debt, Union Pacific (UNP), that included the National City Bank and Rockefeller money, but he assumed the all-consuming task of hands-on manager,"" wrote Cohen. ""A partner observed, 'He could conceive financial transactions of gigantic lines, but at the same time no business detail escaped his attention.' ""But a year later, Schiff heard that Harriman was trying to block the reorganization in order to add the Union Pacific to his own railroad empire. They struck an agreement that would give Harriman a position on the executive board and Kuhn, Loeb would have access to his credit reserves. In 1897, Schiff convinced the U.S. government to provide $87 million to allow his investment group to take full possession of the line, which prospered.In 1900, Schiff tried to acquire the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad for Union Pacific and went up against Hill and Morgan, who wanted to add it to Northern Pacific, which they now owned. Northern Pacific won the bid, but Schiff and Harriman began buying its stock, and on May 9, 1901, the price of a share shot up to $1,000 before the two sides brokered a truce and the price fell back to $150. The agreement gave board seats to the non-owners and promised to minimize competition between the lines, but this later had to be modified under the new antitrust laws.Kuhn, Loeb was now in control of 22,000 miles of railway and held stock worth $321 million (equal to $9.3 billion now), while Schiff was regarded as second only to Morgan in the investment banking world.Kuhn, Loeb financed many other companies in a variety of industries, including Equitable Life Assurance Society, Western Union (WU), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Westinghouse Electric Co.But Schiff's most high-profile loans were to Japan, starting in 1904, when it faced a much stronger Russia and needed to purchase munitions. Eventually, Kuhn, Loeb floated $200 million (worth $5.6 billion today), half its entire war needs. Schiff had also done everything he could over the decades to hinder Russia's ability to get the backing of Wall Street, because of that nation's persecution of Jews. During World War I, Schiff arranged funding for the Allies, as long as none of the money went to Russia.Schiff was as well-known for his philanthropy as for his business success, giving to every kind of Jewish charity and school, but also to benefit the general public, ranging from the Boy Scouts to the National Geographic Society and Red Cross.Newspapers around the world reported his death in 1920 and he was declared ""the greatest Jewish leader of the age.""Kuhn, Loeb was merged with Lehman Bros. in 1977 and the combined firm was acquired in 1984 by American Express (AXP), forming Shearson Lehman/American Express. Kuhn Loeb was spun off in 1994 as Lehman Bros. Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008 (an event that may have helped trigger that year's global financial crisis).""I began studying the history of Wall Street when I worked there and came across Jacob Schiff's story,"" said Michael Driskoll, clinical professor at the Willumstad School of Business at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y. ""Going up against some of the white-shoe firms, he had to be bare-knuckled at times to succeed in a world where racism was rampant, conspiracy theories were rife that Jews ruled the world, and foreigners were under suspicion. Schiff was able to gain respect beyond his own group by advocating assimilation for immigrants, socializing with a wide variety of people, sharing risks with anyone who had the same values and vision, and giving to causes that benefited society at large. There are lessons for those who have to climb the professional ladder without certain advantages.""Leading Jewish banker and philanthropist on Wall Street in the late 19th and early 20th century.Overcame: Anti-Semitism on Wall Street.Lesson: Produce results no one can deny by focusing on getting the details right.""We are only the temporary custodians of our fortunes, and let us be careful that no just complaint can be made against our stewardship.""

90,WFC,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike profit grew 15% to 69 cents a share on 13% revenue growth to $9.79 billion, easily quashing analyst views for 64 cents EPS and $9.39 billion in sales. North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though. Shares plunged to their lowest level in three years on Amazon's deal to buy PillPack.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) cut its revenue guidance on currency headwinds but raised its EPS outlook on greater-than-expected operating efficiencies.Accenture (ACN) delivered a fiscal third-quarter earnings beat.

Xi Jinping pledged to open up China's economy, but there was little or nothing new in the speech. Facebook jumped as Mark Zuckerberg got through congressional hearings largely unscathed. Energy stocks were leaders as oil prices had their biggest week in months. But many leading stocks, including Chinese internets, came under pressure Friday.Facebook (FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced down a Congressional gauntlet during two days of hearings, which followed revelations that political consultant Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully accessed personal data from 87 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica worked with the Trump campaign. Zuckerberg apologized several times for failing to protect user privacy. But he didn't waver in defending Facebook's ad-driven business model.

Europe's Airbus (EADSY) shelved plans for a proposed A320neo-plus and A321neo-plus, according to Reuters. Trade war fears eased after China President Xi Jinping vowed to raise foreign ownership limits in several sectors, including aerospace. But that was largely a repeat of prior promises.U.S. crude futures rose 8.6% to $67.39 a barrel for the week, reflecting tighter global supplies and rising Mideast tensions. Crude settled at its highest level since late 2014. President Trump tweeted that he would fire missiles at Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack, but later said it might not be ""soon."" The Energy Information Administration said weekly domestic crude oil inventories rose by 3.3 million, above analyst expectations. U.S. production increased to 10.53 million barrels per day up from 10.46 million bpd in the prior week. In its monthly report, OPEC raised its non-OPEC oil production guidance Thursday, as crude supplies from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and the U.K. grow.  But the IEA said it expects global stockpiles to fall below the five-year average in a ""month or two"" as inventories are seen falling by 600,000 barrels per day until the end of the year, a sign that OPEC and Russia are nearing the goal of their production cuts. Energy stocks were big winners, with several breaking out past buy points.Delta Air Lines (DAL) said higher fuel costs are a ""wild card"" for its 2018 profit outlook, but signaled global demand will offset that. The carrier also said it would expand its premium-fare offerings this year. Delta's earnings per share topped estimates, while revenue missed. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) also gave more bullish forecasts on first-quarter unit revenue during the week.Policymakers at the March 20-21 meeting were increasingly confident that core inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will get to the 2% target before too long. In other words, most doves have turned to centrists. Meanwhile, the consumer price index showed a 0.1% dip last month. Core CPI rose 0.2%. Core CPI inflation, which runs hotter than the Fed's favored core PCE index, accelerated to 2.1%.Novartis (NVS) will pay $8.7 billion, an 88% premium vs. the prior day's close, for AveXis (AVXS). AveXis is developing AVXS-101, a gene therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy. With Novartis, AveXis would be a stronger rival to Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), which sell spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza. The deal could also spark some interest in takeovers of other gene therapy companies, analysts say.Walmart (WMT) appears to have the lead over Amazon (AMZN) in acquiring a controlling stake in Indian e-commerce heavyweight Flipkart, valuing the company at $20 billion. Bloomberg reported that Flipkart's board is leaning toward Walmart because of the likelihood that it could close the deal promptly and without regulatory pushback. Stateside, Walmart has tapped Postmates in its push to expand online grocery delivery to 40% of the U.S. by year's end. Amazon has expanded two-hour free same-day delivery of Whole Foods products to Prime members.Construction supply giant Fastenal (FAST) tumbled 6% Wednesday after reporting first-quarter results that were just in line with expectations. Earnings per share rose 33% to 61 cents and revenue rose 13% to $1.186 billion. Industry peers MSC Industrial Direct (MSM) and W.W. Grainger (WWW) also sold off that day, and lost about 3% for the week. On Tuesday, MSC Industrial topped earnings estimates and gave a positive outlook on the overall manufacturing climate, but shares were little changed that day.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) will pay $855 million to buy Wilson Therapeutics.

93,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and other bank stocks cruised higher from late 2017 to February on diet of rising Treasury yields, a more-hawkish Fed rate hike outlook, lower corporate taxes, deregulation and a strengthening economy.The Federal Reserve spooked Wall Street by sanctioning Wells Fargo (WFC), sending the stock tumbling in early February. Other big bank stocks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup (C) also retreated.Even as analysts await some big first-quarter earnings gains from the banks, fears of a protracted trade battle with China have raised questions about the impact on the economy, Fed rates and the stock market. Bank stocks are heavily dependent on the economy and interest rates. Their relative strength lines, which measure a stock's performance against the S&P 500, have also flattened.But this is not that unusual. Bank stocks can lead the general market for a stretch, as they did modestly from September to February. But over the long term they struggle to outperform the S&P 500 index, as shown by RS lines. Bank stocks are a big part of the benchmark S&P 500, so if financial stocks are doing well they'll help lift the overall market. Banks tend to rally with the broader economy, which is good news for stocks generally.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup had different issues that held them back.Shares of JPMorgan Chase are making their way through a flat base with a 119.43 buy point. But the stock sliced below its 50-day line on March 22, and has been below the key test of investor support since.Shares rose 1.2% to 110.40 in the stock market today, well off session highs as the major averages pulled back. The stock's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is off recent longtime highs. The RS line rose from early September to late February, but the modest outperformance goes back to last June.CEO Jamie Dimon, in JPMorgan Chase's annual letter to shareholders last week, said that ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war"" could be bad for the global economy. He recommended that the U.S. solicit the aid of Japan and Europe in negotiating a path forward with China.JPMorgan reports earnings Friday morning.Citigroup, which has a large international business, has skidded below its 50-day and 200-day lines over the past month. The bank's RS line has also eased.Citigroup was a top-performing bank in mid-2017, but the RS line has been slumping since October.Shares gained 1.2% on Monday.Citigroup reports fourth-quarter results early Friday.Similar to Citi, Wells Fargo has been submerged below its 50-day and 200-day lines in recent weeks. The stock rose 2 cents on Monday.Wells Fargo, however, has its own unique problems. The Federal Reserve in February hit Wells with sanctions that will prevent it from growing, citing ""widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns"" after revelations that employees were creating fake consumer accounts in attempt to hit lofty sales goals, as well as suspicious practices elsewhere.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reportedly will levy big fines on Wells Fargo soon, Reuters reported Monday.But even before the early February tumble, Wells has been lagging the S&P 500 since late 2016, or even July 2015.Wells Fargo earnings are due Friday.With its large U.S. business, Bank of America, which climbed 0.8% on Monday, is most sensitive to the Fed's actions on interest rates. But similar to its peers, Bank of America shares have tumbled below their 50-day line. The bank's RS line has also flatlined.BofA earnings are on tap next Monday.Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 0.5% to 53.35 on Monday, under their 50-day line but above their 200-day line.

94,WFC,"Capital One Financial (COF) on Tuesday said it nearly halved its share buyback program due a $1.9 billion charge it expects to book from the GOP's tax-cut bill signed into law this month.X The credit-card and loan giant said it had slashed share repurchases to a maximum of $1 billion for the yearlong period that ends on June 30 of next year. In June, Capital One said it had OK'd up to $1.85 billion in share buybacks over that time. It expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share.The announcement makes the company the latest financial giant to forecast a short-term hit to profit due to the tax cuts, which will lower the value of banks' so-called deferred tax assets.Those assets can accrue when a company takes a loss, and are used to ease a company's tax burden. Some banks took big losses during the financial crisis and recession, and racked up those assets when taxes were higher.Bank of America (BAC) this month said it expects the tax cuts to result in a $3 billion hit to profits in the fourth quarter. Earlier this month, before tax reform was passed, Citigroup (C) also said it expected to take a $20 billion hit to earnings due to the write-down of deferred tax assets that would come from the tax cut bill.Still, the tax reform is expected to benefit banks longer-term, and shares of other large companies have rallied in recent months on expectations that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21% will result in dividend hikes, stock repurchases and acquisition deals that offer shareholders hefty premiums.Capital One was down 0.6% at 99.92 on the stock market today, but still above buying territory. Citigroup fell 0.9%, Bank of America dipped 0.3%, JPMorgan (JPM) lost 0.4%, and Wells Fargo (WFC), which is seen as the biggest beneficiary of the corporate tax cuts, eased 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Capital One said the $1.9 billion charge, taken against the company's profits, came largely due to a write-down of its deferred tax assets that the company will book due to the tax cuts, which will lower the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. A one-time tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings also weighed on the company.The plan to cut its buyback came in a regulatory filing, in which the company said it had resubmitted its capital plan to the Fed to address weaknesses in its capital planning process.Citigroup hasn't said if it's plans to return capital to shareholders will be affected, but Bank of America this month said it actually would buy back an extra $5 billion in stock by June 30 of next year. It said earlier that it would repurchase $12 billion.RELATED:Banks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday.

Krzanich framed the chip problem as an industrywide issue and said progress has been made in patching the vulnerabilities.  Meanwhile, Microsoft reported a setback in its efforts to fix the security issues. It suspended issuing patches to guard against the threats after users of PCs with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips complained that the software updates froze their computers.Banking giants JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) topped fourth-quarter earnings views, though Wells' revenue was below estimates.

Broadcom has been struggling for months, with President Trump blocking its bid for fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. Beaten-down Qualcomm also was up overnight on fresh takeover buzz.But investors may want to take a look at Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Both are consolidating well as the stock market rallies.Broadcom was not yet active Friday morning but jumped 4.2% in late trade. That would push the chipmaker above its 50-day moving average and closer to its 200-day line. Technically, the stock is in a consolidation going back to late November, but it hasn't really broken a downtrend.Shares fell late last year as Broadcom mounted a hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm. Both are Apple chipmakers. But the Trump administration blocked the deal on national security grounds, in part on fears that the penny-pinching Broadcom would cut R&D spending, imperiling the U.S. lead in wireless technology.As for Qualcomm, shares plunged after the Broadcom bid collapsed. The stock rose 2.7% in the premarket on a report that ex-Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs is assembling a group to make a go-private takeover offer.Intel rose 3.2% to 52.72 on Thursday, the highest close since September 2000.

109,WFC,"Republicans got an unexpected boost of good publicity after Congress sent the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts to President Trump's desk on Wednesday. Within hours, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) both announced an increase in their minimum wages to $15 an hour, which seemed to provide immediate evidence that the tax cuts would be good for workers.Those announcements came as Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) each said they'll pay out $1,000-apiece bonuses to employees. Trump heaped praise on AT&T in his tax-cut victory speech, and the company may be looking to earn some goodwill as it faces a legal challenge over its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX).The surprise is that the potential gain to workers from corporate tax cuts is supposed to materialize over time, as companies boost productivity-enhancing investment and a more attractive business climate encourages more U.S.-based production. Those supply-side increases, along with lower individual taxes that boost demand, should intensify the bidding war for labor and push wages higher. But none of that stuff has happened yet.So do tax cuts really deserve the credit for wage hikes? Probably at least a little, because they're giving companies an extra shot of confidence about the strength of the economy and a profitable future, but there are other catalysts that may be more important.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Take Wells Fargo, which is trying to turn over a new leaf after having its reputation bruised and battered by the disclosure of improper sales practices. What better publicity opportunity than immediately turning corporate tax cuts into employee wage hikes?The biggest reason Wells Fargo is hiking its minimum wage is likely the current state of the labor market, with unemployment at a 17-year-low of 4.1%, which is putting upward pressure on wages and making it harder to find and retain qualified workers. Wells Fargo previously hiked its minimum wage to a range of $12 to $16 an hour, depending on location, in March 2016. Then, after Bank of America (BAC) said it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in December 2016, Wells Fargo followed the next month by lifting its base wage to a range of $13.50 to $17.It's not clear whether the latest increase to $15 an hour, which will take effect in March, will be accompanied by much of a boost to entry-level workers whose hourly pay already exceeds $15.The focus of the announcements on a $15 minimum wage suggests that part of the credit likely goes to the $15 wage movement and its success in spurring a number of states and cities, as well as private employers like Target (TGT), to hike their minimum wages. In January, California's minimum wage will rise to $11 an hour and $12 a year later, on the way to $15 by 2022. New York City's minimum wage will hit $15 at the end of 2018. Since the minimum wage applies to the lowest-skilled work, bank tellers expect to make well above the minimum wage.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The Most6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

111,WFC,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

115,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most from corporate tax cuts among major U.S. banks, followed by PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC), finds a new analysis by Goldman Sachs.X Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden sees an average 13% boost to bank earnings in 2018 from a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, factoring in some other tax changes that would act as a drag on earnings. Those other changes include a new limit on the deduction of FDIC premiums paid by banks, which would cut most big banks' earnings by 1%, as well as changes in international taxation and the loss of various tax credits. Banks with a bigger international presence generally would get a more modest boost to profits.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Wells Fargo earnings are seen getting a 17% boost from the GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, followed by 15% for PNC, 14% for BofA, 12% for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and 8% for Citigroup (C).Goldman also notes that most banks it follows will write down deferred tax assets because the tax legislation limits their ability to deduct past losses, denting after-tax profits. Citigroup said earlier this month that it expected to take a $20 billion charge related to the tax bill, including roughly $16 billion from deferred tax assets. The Financial Times reported that Bank of America may lose $3 billion due to loss deduction limits.Bank stocks outperformed the broad market on Monday, even as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite recorded moderate gains and scored all-time highs.Wells Fargo rose 1.76%, BofA 1.5%, Citigroup 1.2%, PNC 0.9% and JPMorgan 0.8% on the stock market today.RELATED:Federal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksCongress To Vote On Tax Bill; Micron, FedEx Report: Investing Action Plan

Tuesday's rebound from the 50-day moving average offered a possible new buying opportunity, though investors should try to buy 50-day/10-week rebounds as quickly as possible.Goldman Sachs climbed 0.8% to 241.36, near a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base and moving above its 50-day line in strong volume.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are key reasons why the Dow industrials rallied and the S&P 500 was nearly flat as the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled.Citigroup rose 1.8% to 75.04.

Schwab is just within range of a 46.31 buy point of a flat base cleared on Tuesday. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) climbed 1.7%, now extended.Several factors appeared to be driving the rally in financials.The GOP's tax-cut plan on Tuesday cleared the Senate Budget Committee along party lines, moving the bill closer to a full vote in the chamber. A full Senate vote could come this week.The bill, which would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, is likely to contain a tax-raising mechanism that would kick in if the benefits from the tax cuts don't pan out as expected, easing concerns about the debt.But other GOP lawmakers are opposed to that mechanism. The Senate bill also still needs to be fused together with the House's.Jerome Powell, who President Trump has chosen to succeed Janet Yellen as head the Federal Reserve, said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that ""the case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together"" while also stressing that he sees no sign of economic ""overheating."" The next policy meeting takes place on Dec. 12-13.When the Fed raises the rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other to meet financial quotas, banks pass the higher costs on to consumers, often through raising rates on their own loans. The higher rates help improve banks' financial results.Meanwhile, Powell hinted that he favors relief on financial rules. While not a surprise, the combination of steady of monetary policy and regulatory relief is positive for banks.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose Wednesday. That rate also influences the rates on credit that banks offer to their customers.Wall Street has been concerned about the flattening of the yield curve, a gauge of inflation expectations that tracks the difference between short-term and long-term government debt. Earlier this month, the gap between the short end and long end of that curve was at its narrowest in a decade, raising concerns about a weaker economy. The yield spread widened slightly on Wednesday.The short end of that curve has crept up as the Fed raises rates. When Wall Street expects the economy to be stronger in the years ahead, the long end of the curve rises, as future economic growth raises prices and investors demand a greater return on their bonds to make up for the declining buying power of the dollar.Rising yields were definitely a factor Wednesday. Dow financials JPMorgan, Goldman and American Express (AXP) rallied, but Visa (V) fell sharply. Visa doesn't hold credit balances, so higher rates don't offer a benefit.The U.K. and the EU are reportedly coming closer to agreeing on what the island nation will pay to get out of the bloc.

122,WFC,"The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, but left little doubt that the next hike is on tap for December.The post-meeting statement signaled no change from the Fed's policy of continuing to gradually adjust rates higher.""Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2% objective over the medium term,"" the statement read.The status quo, at least according to Fed members' projections in December, called for one more rate hike this year and three in 2018. While the latter is far from clear, markets see a December hike as a virtual certainty.President Trump said Wednesday that he will announce his nomination for Federal Reserve chief on Thursday afternoon. He praised current chief Janet Yellen, but is expected to pick Fed Gov. Jerome Powell.Treasury yields slipped ahead of the Fed statement, possibly related to a delay in Republicans releasing tax legislation. After the statement, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped further, while major stock indexes moved higher.Financial stocks, which can benefit from higher interest rates, held onto gains after the Fed news. Wells Fargo was up 0.1% at 56.21 after briefly crossing a buy point at 56.70.IBD'S TAKE: A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for near-term gains. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks poised for near-term gains.Despite inflation undershooting the Fed's 2% target, policymakers are still expressing confidence that inflation will eventually reach that goal in the medium term. The vote to leave rates unchanged was unanimous.Competitive factors have contributed to low inflation in a wide array of industries, and that may be slow to change. However, the Fed expects that upward pressure on wages will eventually feed through to price pressures.There is pretty clear evidence that wage pressures are building. Daily Treasury statements show that federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks are now growing at 6% from a year ago, according to an IBD analysis. That's the best sustained rate of growth since early 2008. and a signal that 3% wage growth may finally have arrived.The tax receipt data, which offer the broadest, most timely read on the health of the labor market, are consistent with what companies are saying and doing. Target (TGT) announced last month that it's hiking its minimum wage to $11 an hour this month as it recruits 100,000 seasonal workers.

The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, which opened with solid gains to fresh record highs, pared much of their early gains following the ISM release.The recovery in Treasury yields in the past six weeks, helped by stronger economic growth and improving tax-cut odds, have coincided with investors showing renewed interest in bank stocks. On Wednesday morning, shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) briefly cleared a buy point at 56.70 from a double-bottom base. A buy point is the point at which investors have the best chance of near-term gains.But Wells Fargo lost a little ground after the ISM report and was trading up 0.8% at 56.61.Meanwhile, automakers were reporting October U.S. auto sales.

General Electric (GE) held the biggest gain in the Dow, up 1.3%, but that means little in the context of GE's 12% drop so far this week.Quality growth stocks also struggled.

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today was below the previous session's pace.Trump is expected to announce that the U.S. is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

The U.S. would then eventually move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.On a quieter note, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee approved a bipartisan rollback to parts of the Dodd-Frank law in a 16-7 vote Tuesday. Four Democrats on the panel voted with the majority. The rollback has the support of nine Democrats in the Senate, and initial support from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Yellen's replacement Jerome Powell.The bipartisan legislation doesn't involve a full repeal.The bill would raise the trigger for more intense regulation of financial firms from the current $50 billion in assets to $250 billion, thus easing the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions. This would benefit firms such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), which rose five sessions in a row before pulling back Tuesday and so far Wednesday; SunTrust Banks (STI), which rose six sessions in a row before its pullback; and American Express (AXP), which advanced six sessions in a row, going into Wednesday's session.Major money centers such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) would not get a break. At midday, all three were down slightly.Bank stocks, including the big players, have benefited on the belief that the Federal Reserve will crank interest rates at least a quarter point after the Fed meets Dec. 12-13. CME Group's FedWatch Tool estimates the odds of a rate hike at 100%. The only difference is between those who expect a quarter-point hike (90.2%) and those who see a half-point increase (9.8%).A half-point increase would be a bold move, and the Ben Bernanke/Janet Yellen Fed isn't known for boldness.In recent sessions, the chipmakers, chip designers and chip-equipment makers have fallen 9% to 14% off their highs. As of Tuesday's close, the chip sector fell to No. 8 among 33 sectors — its worst ranking of the year.Speculation among market watchers swirls around two views: Either chip stocks will offer a buying opportunity when they stop falling and rebound or their leadership position will be turned over to some other sector such as banks and financials.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, solar and steel producers led the upside. Oil-related stocks led the downside.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a gauge of consumer confidence, decreased in December. The overall reading dropped to 51.9 from 53.6 in November.""It's worth noting that the tax reform package President Trump championed and is nearing passage hasn't led to a jump in optimism,"" said Terry Jones, IBD's commentary editor.Despite the drop in December, the optimism gauge remains in positive territory. The index has held above the neutral level of 50 for 15 months in a row.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?New Highs: Are Stocks Pivoting To New Leadership?

126,WFC,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) bounced higher on Monday after the Senate this weekend passed its version of a plan to cut taxes, putting within reach a major GOP legislative victory and some long-awaited rewards for bank shareholders.X The Senate bill still needs to be reconciled with a bill from the House, a process set to begin this week. But the Senate bill contains particular rewards for banks.In particular, banks retained the ability to avoid taxes by steering payments to offshore subsidiaries, the New York Times noted. An earlier version of the Senate legislation sought to close off that benefit. And the bill allows banks to leave out payments pertaining to derivatives when tallying their taxes.Goldman shares rose 0.7% to close at 250.65 on the stock market today, adding to last week's 5.5% jump. The stock was still in range of a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. JPMorgan surged 2.1%, after last week's 6.6% pop. Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 1.4%. Bank of America (BAC) surged 3.4%; Citigroup (C) gained 2.1% and Wells Fargo (WFC) added 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.More broadly, the banks also would benefit if the tax cuts manage to accelerate the economy and spur loan growth. Stronger economic growth and inflation would likely prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — a move that lifts borrowing costs to keep overexpansion in check but boosts banks' profits by allowing them to foist the higher costs onto the customers that receive credit from them.The Fed seems likely to decide to raise rates at its next policy meeting on Dec. 12-13.Higher expectations for a better economy and, in turn, rising prices, would also raise yields on the longer-term government bonds that influence the value of some loans. Those yields rise when investors seek a greater return on their bonds to offset the weaker buying power of the dollar over time.The short end of the yield curve — a measure of the difference between short-term and long-term government debt —  has risen as the Fed raises rates. But the spread between the short end and the long end of the curve has been particularly narrow, a sign of a potentially weaker economy.Meanwhile, banks this year have also dealt with muted loan growth and trading results.""Lower tax rates will increase banks' profitability, but higher profits may benefit shareholders more than creditors if dividends or share buybacks also increase,"" Celina Vansetti-Hutchins, managing director at Moody's, said in a statement on Saturday.""In addition,"" Vansetti-Hutchins said, ""lower tax rates will result in one-time write-downs of deferred tax assets, and home values may face downward pressure, with a potential negative effect on banks' mortgage loan books and a modest second order negative impact on other consumer loans.""RELATED:Top Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These 3 SectorsBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisGOP Has Votes For Tax Bill, McConnell Says; S&P 500 Pares Flynn Losses

127,WFC,"Stocks bounced back big time Thursday as Wal-Mart (WMT), Cisco (CSCO) and Apple (AAPL) powered the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite hit a new high.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rallied 1.4%, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gained 0.9% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) also rose 0.9%. Emerging markets led with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) running up more than 2%.Wal-Mart soared 10% after its Q3 results topped views, while Cisco leapt 6% on a quarterly profit beat and a better-than-expected outlook. Apple rose 1.4%, on track to snap a five-session losing streak. The Dow component is still extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point. GBH Insights said the iPhone maker could potentially hit a market cap of $1 trillion next year.Among sector plays in the stock market today, retail, semiconductors and consumer staples scored big gains. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) gained more 2%, boosted by Wal-Mart. The ETF regained its 50-day line for the first time in nearly three weeks.Utility and energy funds were among the few laggards. West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped, while gold futures were slightly higher.The stock market had been coming off its highs — but the recent pullback may give investors a chance to buy previously extended names.Vanguard High Dividend Yield (VYM), which owns Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),  JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) is getting close to a potential test of its 50-day moving average.If it finds support at the line and makes a solid rebound, it could set up a new opportunity to buy shares. After regaining its 50-day line in early September, the fund rose 6% to its Oct. 23 intraday high. It offered another buy point Sept. 11 on a breakout from a flat base — and advanced 4% through the Oct. 23 peak.VYM was last featured in this June 16 ETF column, just ahead of its breakout from a prior flat base. It cleared the buy point June 19, before easing the next session to start the most recent pattern.The fund, which marked its 11th year last week, has amassed $20.1 billion in assets. It tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which comprises U.S. companies that tend to pay above-average dividends. VYM offers a 2.9% annualized dividend yield, above the 1.9% average payout of the S&P 500.Technology accounted for the ETF's biggest sector weight as of Oct. 31, at about 15% of assets. Financials came next at 14%, followed by roughly 13% a piece in health care, consumer goods and industrials. Oil & gas and utilities represented 9% and 8%, respectively, while consumer services, telecommunications and basic materials made up the rest.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer examination? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.Top five holdings are Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil and Wells Fargo.

128,WFC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) grew its stake in Bank of America (BAC) in the third quarter, while other top buys included Apple (AAPL), Synchrony Financial (SYF) and Monsanto (MON).XBerkshire bought 3.9 million more shares of Apple, boosting its stake by 3% to 134.1 million, according to a regulatory disclosure on Tuesday. It slashed its stake in IBM (IBM) by 17.1 million shares and Charter Communications (CHTR) by just under 1 million shares. Wells Fargo (WFC), its top holding with a roughly $26 billion market value, got a haircut too.Meanwhile, David Tepper's Appaloosa hedge fund cut its Bank of America stake by 28% during Q3, sold out of Wells Fargo, and doubled its Apple stake.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital slashed its Apple stake by 44% to 2.19 million shares, cut its stake in General Motors (GM) by 36% to 34.6 million shares and bought 3.6 million shares of Tempur Sealy (TPX).Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management hedge fund offloaded Alphabet (GOOGL) shares worth $66 million. But it loaded up on other so-called FANG stocks, buying nearly $500 million worth of Netflix (NFLX), $275 million of Amazon.com (AMZN) and $229 million of Facebook (FB).IBD'S TAKE: Banks are also poised to benefit from deregulation and more rate hikes that could come from the Federal Reserve if the economy grows under a Trump administration.Earlier Tuesday, Jana Partners stocked up on Jack In The Box (JACK), buying 1.3 million shares in the fast-food chain.Jana, an activist investor, had pushed for the sale of Whole Food Market, pocketing $300 million after it agreed to be acquired by Amazon.com (AMZN).

129,WFC,"The competition to succeed Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair is reportedly down to current Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor, with Yellen herself now out of the running.XPowell is seen as a safer pick, because he's likely to stay on the same accommodative monetary policy course charted by Yellen that's been bullish for the stock market.President Trump, whose real estate background has made him a fan of low interest rates, is expected to make a decision soon.Taylor is more of a wild card. He believes in a rules-based approach to monetary policy, rather than one based on intuition, and created the Taylor Rule that implies the Fed's key lending rate should be higher than it is now — perhaps close to 2 percentage points higher.But Taylor expressed more flexibility in a recent speech, saying that rules are important, but central bankers ""can deviate from those rules as long as they explain why,"" Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, told IBD.There's not much doubt about whom bond investors want to get the job. ""The market sold off on headlines that President Trump had been 'impressed' after a meeting with John Taylor and subsequently rallied on stories that he was leaning towards tapping Fed Governor Jay Powell,"" wrote Jefferies economists in a wrap-up of last week's developments.The 10-year Treasury yield was little changed on Thursday after closing at a seven-month high of 2.44% on Wednesday. The rise in rates has come amid evidence of solid global growth, a booming stock market and the Fed's initial move to start unwinding the trillions in asset purchases it made to buoy the economy after the financial crisis. Still, some market participants have pointed to the changing of the guard at the Fed as an important contributor to the uptick in Treasury yields.Whatever the cause, the higher long-term yields have been good news for bank net interest margins and bank stocks. On Thursday, shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) advanced 0.7% to 55.62, closing in on a 56.70 buy point from a double-bottom base. A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best chance of securing near-term gains.Among other major banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 0.7%, Bank of America (BAC) 0.4%, Goldman Sachs (GS) 1 cent, and Morgan Stanley (MS) 0.4% on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase is at all-time highs, while Bank of America is at a nine-year best; both are extended from recent breakouts. Morgan Stanley is at the edge of a buy range, while Goldman Sachs is near a cup-with-handle entry.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Tuesday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. While even Yellen had opened the door to some softening of the tighter banking regulations put in place after the crisis, Powell and Taylor would likely be somewhat more amenable to deregulation, one of Trump's priorities.Prediction markets see Powell as the clear favorite, with about 60% odds of being appointed vs. about 20% for Taylor.Taylor criticized the Yellen Fed for waiting until December 2015 to begin raising interest rates, saying that low rates discouraged lending, adversely affected savers and contributed to slow economic growth.Bandholz expects that the initial market reaction will be less favorable if Taylor is appointed, but there's reason to think the difference might be just short-term. Fed Chairman Taylor would likely be more pragmatic than Professor Taylor, Bandholz said.RELATED:The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltECB Will Slow Asset Buys But Draghi Remains Cautious5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumFlood Warning: Federal Reserve, Treasury Both Set To Unload DebtStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

130,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) will test a mobile app for Apple (AAPL) iPhones that enables people to create and control a bank account via their phone and — in an effort to draw smartphone-anchored millennials — ""sort their spending with emojis,"" according to a Reuters report.XThe bank also plans to market the app, called Finn by Chase, on Android phones next year.The app arrives as banks try to determine how to reach customers that are more likely to do business online. Banks are also grappling with what the purpose of their branch locations — where people for generations have gone to cash checks or make deposits — should be in a landscape where financial technology allows more people to manage their finances over their phones.JPMorgan's own mobile customers grew by 12% in the third quarter. But mobile payment options from an array of fintech startups and bigger competitors like PayPal (PYPL) Venmo, Facebook (FB), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have proliferated.Zelle, a payment platform that has the backing of Chase and giants like Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), launched a peer-to-peer payment app last month.JPMorgan will first test the Finn by Chase app for Apple users who have ZIP codes in St. Louis, Reuters reported. Chase has no branches in that city. The bank will expand marketing of the app to other U.S. cities in 2018, Reuters said.Mobile enrollment for standard checking and savings accounts will be offered at some point this year, Reuters said. Finn by Chase debit cards will be mailed to enrollees, Reuters said.The bank last year said that millennials made up ""the majority of our new deposit customers"". But Reuters notes that JPMorgan has become too large to get new depositors via an acquisition.In researching how to develop the Finn by Chase app, Reuters said, Chase found that many of the millennials it interviewed found wanted a better way to manage their spending than simply trying to adhere to a budget — something they've found difficult to do. Finn by Chase's developers created the app to enable users to tag certain types of spending with emojis according to how that spending made them feel.During the bank's third-quarter earnings call this month, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said that ""branches still matter,"" but that it was responding to technological changes in banking and closing and consolidating branches when necessary.JPMorgan fell 0.2% to 99.34 in the stock market today, at the high end of a range from a 95.32 buy point. Bank of America fell 1 cent to 27.16, modestly extended from its own buy point. Wells Fargo dipped 1 cent as well as the scandal-tainted giant struggles toward a double-bottom entry.RELATED:Goldman Nears Buy Point As Bank Stocks Rally On Move Toward Tax CutsHere's How Rivals Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Are DivergingJPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax Reform

131,WFC,"Bears swatted two segments of the stock market midday Wednesday, knocking down small caps and bank stocks for a second straight session.XThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 were little changed midday as the two major indexes slipped 0.1% each. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was down on both major exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday.After falling 1.3% Tuesday, the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.5% in midday trade Wednesday. Meanwhile, the PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) exchange traded fund dropped 1% after skidding 2.3% in the previous session.Reuters noted that the yield curve is near its flattest level in a decade. A normal yield curve offers higher yields on long-term bonds than on short-term bonds.  A flat yield curve is a situation where yields are close together; this can be a precursor to economic trouble. An inverted yield curve involves yields that are higher short term than long term — a signal of recession, according to some market watchers.On Wednesday, the big money-center bank group was on track for its fourth loss in as many days. So far this week, Bank of America (BAC) is down 4.5%; JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is off almost 4%; Wells Fargo (WFC) is off 3.5%; Citigroup (C), 2%; Morgan Stanley (MS), 2%; and Goldman Sachs (GS), 1.5%.Small caps had some wild performers. Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) screamed 16% lower after missing earnings estimates by 48%. Drone maker AeroVironment (AVAV) dropped 9% in heavy volume, apparently on valuation concerns.On the bullish side, the day's top gainers included food groups and diversified operations, which are defensive plays. This theme, however, was not consistent. Other conservative plays, such as utilities and tobacco, were losing ground.Another factor that the stock market had to digest was the Republican defeat in several elections. Democrats won the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also won the mayoral race in Manchester (New Hampshire's largest city) and had a strong showing in several states up and down the ballot.For the stock market, the results could affect Republican efforts to get a tax-cut package approved.RELATED:Crude Oil Stockpiles Unexpectedly RiseSalesforce.com's Forecast Is Bullish Through 2022

Disney reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.Among sector plays in the stock market today, utilities, consumer staples and real estate advanced. But retail, banks and semiconductors sagged. VanEck Vectors Semiconductors (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) dipped. Microchip Technology and Skyworks Solutions sank 4% and 5%, respectively. Skyworks' in-line guidance for the current quarter disappointed.SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) sank 2.7% and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) fell 2.3%. Big banks weighed on the Dow as JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) gave up about 2% each.Gold and oil funds were  lower, along with their underlying commodity prices.If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. The adage oft holds true for exchange traded funds, too.VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT), which counts Visa (V) among its top holdings, is looking for support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back from a late October intraday high. A solid rebound off the line could set up a new chance to buy shares. The fund was last featured Oct. 2 in this column, as it cleared a 40.37 buy point of a flat base.It advanced 2% before heading back down toward the 50-day line. MOAT showed similar action this past spring. It climbed past a flat-base entry in early May, but turned tail soon after. After finding support at the 50-day, shares rose nearly 7% before starting the most recent flat-base pattern.The $1.3 billion fund, which launched in April 2012, tracks the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index. The index is comprised of stocks that Morningstar Direct's equity research team deems to have sustainable competitive advantages and are attractively priced.Health care represented the biggest sector weight in the fund as of Sept. 30, at nearly 35% of assets.

133,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings Friday, amid strong loan demand, while Wells Fargo (WFC) fell short on revenue as lending slowed.The results come a day after earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C), whose shares, some analysts said, were weighed down by worries over credit as the current credit cycle advances into the later stages.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) will close out the big banks' earnings season next week.Bank of America's earnings per share rose 17% to $0.48, beating Zacks estimates for 46 cents. Revenue was up 1% to $22.08 billion, just beating forecasts for $21.981 billion.As with other banks, BofA's trading overall remained weak compared to a year ago, when geopolitical shocks churned markets. Banks face particularly tough comparisons to 2016, when surprises like Brexit and President Trump's election spurred brisk trading activity.Revenue for fixed income, currencies and commodities fell 22%, but rose 2% for equities.Consumer banking revenue rose 10% to $8.8 billion, global banking revenue climbed 5% to $5 billion, and global wealth and investment management revenue gained 6% to $4.6 billion. Loans grew by 8%, 4% and 8%, respectively, across those three businesses. Net charge-offs rose 1%.Overall, BofA's loan-loss reserves fell by 2%. In its consumer banking division, the bank set aside an extra $269 million for credit losses, citing ""credit card seasoning and loan growth."" The bank said credit quality remained strong.JPMorgan and Citigroup on Thursday also said they padded their reserves during the third quarter to cover credit-card losses.Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said Bank of America's shares ""underperformed yesterday ... as the market saw elevated credit costs for Citi and JPM as an omen for BAC earnings.""""However, on balance, BAC's results stack up better than those of peers,"" Chubak said, citing better-than-expected credit, net interest income, loan growth and expense management.Bank of America shares rose 1.5% to 25.83 in the stock market today, back above a 25.45 entry after sinking to 25.12 in the morning. BofA fell to 25.45 on Thursday.Wells Fargo, meanwhile, reported EPS up 1% to $1.04, which excludes a litigation accrual of 20 cents a share related to a pre-financial-crisis mortgage-related investigation. The figure was in line with expectations. But revenue fell 2% to $21.9 billion, missing estimates for $22.32 billion.Net interest income grew 4% to $12.5 billion. Net interest margin, a measure of the difference between the interest taken in from loans and paid to depositors, was 2.87%.""We are waiting for the quarter that Wells shows stronger momentum across the business and this was not the quarter,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a research note on Friday, adding that loan growth and the bank's net interest margin were lower than they expected.Total loan balance was $951.9 billion, down $5.5 billion from Q2 and $9.45 billion from a year ago. Q3 marked the third straight sequential decline in loan balance. The net loan charge-off rate rose to 0.3% from 0.27% in Q2. Total deposits climbed by $5.2 billion during Q3 to $1.3 trillion.Shares fell 2.75% to 53.69. The stock also retreated Thursday, moving further from a double-bottom base buy point of 56.70.Wells Fargo continues to deal with scrutiny over its sales practices amid allegations of fabricating accounts, altering home loans and giving customers auto insurance they didn't want. Analysts, as they have for the past year, will be looking for signals that the bank can make things right with consumers and investors.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Across most of the big money center banks, trading has been a sore spot for the second and third quarters as well, and could be for the rest of the year.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday, forecast weak fourth-quarter trading results, saying there was nothing obvious on the horizon that would give them a boost.Still, JPMorgan's third-quarter EPS topped estimates. Lending was solid. Higher interest rates, a result of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, also helped. Citigroup's (C) results were also better than analysts expected.But analysts raised concerns about the increases in provisions that the banks set aside to cover bad loans.Citigroup in Q3 set aside an extra $500 million related to its North American card business, based on its expectations for bad loans and the effects of recent hurricanes. JPMorgan said net card charge-offs were higher during the third quarter and that it had added $300 million in credit-card reserves, largely due to the ""seasoning of newer vintages.""Analysts have said that investments in Citigroup's Costco (COST) card, and other cards, could start adding to earnings in the second half of this year. But Citigroup's branded-card revenues in North America fell 1% in the third quarter, adding to investors' disappointment.CFO John Gerspach said that the Costco card ""remains a real winner"" and that they were seeing growth in account balances and purchases.Moody's warned in June that over the last several quarters, credit-card charge-offs, or debt a lender believes it has next to no chance of getting back, had ""increased materially for some US lenders,"" amounting to the biggest spike since 2009.JPMorgan, the firm said then, had put up a ""more stable performance,"" while Bank of America was strong and Citigroup appeared to ""be weakening only slightly.""""We continue to believe that credit will continue to normalize at a relatively slow pace, and we are not overly concerned with the pickup in delinquency rates this quarter,"" Kleinhanzl wrote in a research note on Thursday.JPMorgan dipped 0.1% to 95.88 but rebounded from an intraday low of 94.96, briefly dropping below a 95.32 buy point. Citigroup slipped 0.4%, but off session lows.RELATED:JPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformBitcoin Hits Record; JPMorgan 'Open Minded' To Regulated Digital CashBank Of America, JPMorgan Lead 5 Banks Hitting Buys As GOP Tax Plan Boosts YieldsBuffett Says He'll Hold This Bank Stock For A 'Long, Long, Long' TimeCould Goldman Sachs Be The First Bank To Offer Bitcoin Trades?

134,WFC,"Rivals Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst forecasts. But while shares of Morgan Stanley glided higher on sturdier results across the board, Goldman tripped, with some analysts parsing the quality of the numbers beyond the headline figures.The results from the two banks follow weakness in the kind of trading that Goldman Sachs has built its reputation on, whereas Morgan Stanley's more conservative, stable wealth management business has gained strength. That business has put up higher returns as it draws in high-net-worth clients.""This business is very strong, and Goldman doesn't have this kind of business,"" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said.Wealth management helps to insulate Morgan Stanley from the whims of the market, and could help the bank deliver firmer earnings than Goldman further out, he said.Shares close up 0.4% at 49.12 on the stock market today, still within buy range of a 48.59 entry of a cup-with-handle base, putting Morgan Stanley's market cap at $90 billion, while Goldman fell 2.6% to 236.09, with its market cap now at $91 billion. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley briefly topped Goldman in valuation.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Nomura analyst Steven Chubak also said in a research note that much of the strength in Goldman's results came from ""lower-quality"" areas that are more volatile and more capital-intensive, such as fixed-income and investing and lending, where revenue jumped 35%.But without the jump in investing and lending and a lower tax rate, he said, earnings per share, which rose 3% to $5.02, wouldn't have beaten estimates by nearly as much. Analysts expected $4.31, according to Zacks Investment Research.The bank's equities and investment management divisions produced results that he characterized as somewhat disappointing. And Chubak said that despite Goldman's strength in lining up mergers and acquisitions during the quarter, lower backlogs in its investment banking division ""raise questions on the near-term sustainability of IB momentum.""Still, Goldman's top and bottom line both unexpectedly rose. Revenue increased 2% to $8.326 billion, beating forecasts for a decline to $7.638 billion.Goldman's investment banking revenue rose 17% to $1.8 billion. Equity revenue fell 7% to $1.67 billion. Investment management revenue rose 3% to $1.53 billion.Fixed income revenue for Goldman sank 26% to $1.45 billion. That compared to Morgan Stanley's 20% drop to $1.2 billion. Morgan, like others, cited a mix of lower volatility and muted activity during the quarter.But investors on Tuesday looked upon Morgan Stanley more favorably, and the bank continued its streak of solid trading results. Revenue in the bank's trading business fell 8% — but that was better than any other large bank during the quarter.Trading from JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) has been weaker this year, after Brexit and the surprise election President Trump upended markets last year.Morgan Stanley's fixed-income desk beat Goldman's in both this year's first and second quarters. That outperformance occurred despite Morgan's moves away from trading and toward wealth management in the years since the financial crisis.Morgan's results in Q3 proved to be solid elsewhere. Investment banking revenue grew to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion. Wealth management revenue grew to $4.2 billion from $3.9 billion. Sales and trading net revenue fell to $2.9 billion from $3.2 billion a year ago, with equity revenue flat at $1.9 billion.Earnings per share jumped 15% to 93 cents, beating views for 81 cents, while revenue picked up by 3% to $9.917 billion, topping estimates for $8.95 billion.""Our third quarter results reflected the stability our Wealth Management, Investment Banking and Investment Management businesses bring when our Sales and Trading business faces a subdued environment,"" said Chairman and CEO James Gorman in a statement. ""Our balanced business model and the consistent performance of our franchise enabled us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders.""RELATED:Strong Retail Banking Lifts BofA; Wells Fargo Revenue MissesJPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformBitcoin Hits Record; JPMorgan 'Open Minded' To Regulated Digital Cash

135,WFC,"Four of the six big banks — JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) — report third-quarter earnings this week. Results for Q3, like the second quarter, are expected to be, well, not exactly amazing.XWeak trading: still persisting in the absence of big market jolts like Brexit or President Trump's election. Weak loan growth, particularly in commercial and industrial loans: still persisting as businesses stay conservative amid political uncertainty. Political uncertainty: still persisting as investors wait for the Trump administration and Congress to push through tax and regulatory reform. Inflation data has also been weak.To all of that, we can add hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which analysts say could further weigh on lending and push up delinquencies and net charge-offs, or debt that a lender believes probably won't be repaid.But bank stocks have rebounded since September, with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America among those still in buy range, while Citigroup is trading at a longtime high and Wells Fargo is closing on a potential entry.A rebound in the 10-year Treasury yield and Federal Reserve rate hike expectations, partly on indications of better global growth and initial details of Trump's tax plan, have helped lift bank stocks. But Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, in a recent interview conducted by his firm, said improvement on a macro level was needed to keep the rally going.""Given third quarter was weak and 2017 is almost over, we believe investors may continue to look past quarterly results this year with an eye on 'bluer skies' down the road for bank earnings and stock prices,"" he said.Estimates: JPMorgan Chase reports earnings on Thursday. Earnings per share are expected to rise 6% to $1.67, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is seen up 3% to $25.397 billion.Other things to watch for: According to a recent note from Barclays, 9% of JPMorgan's deposits come from Houston and Miami, which were hit hard by Harvey and Irma. Texas and Florida also account for more than 15% of the bank's credit card and auto loans.Barclays also notes that JPMorgan recently passed the one-year anniversary of the debut of its premium Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Barclays said more commentary could come from executives over the card's performance. JPMorgan has slashed the card's sign-up bonus and is trying to cut costs in the unit that oversees the card.Shares dipped 0.3% to close at 96.84 in the stock market today. The stock is in buy range from a 95.32 flat-base entry.Estimates: Citigroup reports on Thursday. EPS is seen at $1.30, a 4% gain, with revenue edging 0.5% higher to $17.847 billion. Other things to watch for: Citigroup's acquisition of the Costco (COST) credit card last year is expected to begin adding to earnings in the second half of this year, Barclays notes.Barclays will also be looking for insights into world markets.""Given (Citigroup's) fingers are all over the globe, touching both consumer and corporates, we will be listening carefully to its global outlook and client trends,"" analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note.Shares esased 0.3% to 74.94, still extended from a 69.96 buy point.Estimates: Bank of America reports Friday. Wall Street expects EPS up 10% to 45 cents on revenue up 2% to $22.062 billion.Other things to watch for: Credit cards here, too. While Bank of America sold off its U.K. credit card business in June, it has also launched its own high-end Premium Rewards card intended to compete with Chase Sapphire Reserve and others in the battle for well-to-do millennial consumers.Shares edged down 0.4% to 25.83, still in range from a 25.45 entry.Estimates: Wells Fargo, which reports on Friday, is expected to show EPS up 1% to $1.04, with revenue essentially flat at $22.314 billion.  Other things to watch for: Wells Fargo continues to face outrage over shady sales practices, which over the past year have included allegations of opening unauthorized consumer accounts, foisting unwanted auto insurance on customers, and surreptitiously altering home loans of borrowers that were in bankruptcy.""We hope to get updates on these issues, in terms of both customer retribution and potential additional regulatory fines,"" Goldberg said.The bank has also warned that the hurricanes could result in higher net charge-offs on auto loans in the third and fourth quarters, Goldberg said.Shares ticked 0.1% higher to 55.66, approaching a double-bottom base buy point of 56.70.RELATED:Buffett Says He'll Hold This Bank Stock For A 'Long, Long, Long' TimeCould Goldman Sachs Be The First Bank To Offer Bitcoin Trades?Bank Of America, JPMorgan Lead 5 Banks Hitting Buys As GOP Tax Plan Boosts YieldsCitigroup Warns On Trading But Bank Stocks Rally On Rising Yields

139,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said Thursday that trading will likely be weak again in the fourth quarter, with no overt catalysts on the horizon, even as the effects of natural and man-made cataclysms loom.While the bank topped Q3 earnings forecasts, trading revenue dropped 16% to $5.5 billion, with fixed income revenue down 27% and equity market revenue down 4%.Brexit and Donald Trump's surprise election victory sparked a surge in volatility and trading last year, but activity has since quieted, weighing on banks' trading desks.A flurry of big events recently also won't appear to have much impact. Catalonia's attempt to separate from Spain was unlikely to ""materially"" affect business sentiment and global growth elsewhere could cushion against any minor difficulties, said CEO Jamie Dimon on a conference call with reporters.Hurricanes in the U.S. and Caribbean and earthquakes in Mexico had affected ""many of our customers,"" the bank said in a statement, but management said during the call that their financial impact was ""not significant.""And as Wall Street waits for tax reform from Washington, D.C., CFO Marianne Lake indicated that JPMorgan wasn't emphasizing the subject in talks with some of its clients about loans.""At this point, it's not front and center in the dialog we're having with our clients about whether they should or shouldn't do a strategic deal or take an action,"" she said on a conference call with analysts. ""So I would say it's neither holding up business nor spurring business. But that could change.""Shares slipped 0.9% to 95.99 in the stock market today, still within range of a 95.32 buy point of a flat base. Citigroup (C), which also beat views, fell 3.4% to 72.37 after briefly hitting its best intraday level since January 2009. Shares have now fallen back into buy range from a 69.96 entry, but the huge-volume slide should give investors pause.Among peers that report Friday, Bank of America (BAC) fell 1.5% to right at its 24.45 buy point, and Wells Fargo (WFC) eased 0.8% to 55.21, edging away from a double-bottom base buy point of 56.70.Goldman Sachs (GS) dipped 1.1% to 239.80, and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 1.2% to 48.59. Both investment banking giants report next week.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.JPMorgan's Q3 earnings per share of rose 11% to $1.76, topping Zacks Investment Research estimates for $1.67. Managed revenue grew 3% to $26.2 billion, while reported revenue of $25.33 billion fell short of Zacks views for $25.68 billion. Average core loans rose 7%, slowing from the previous quarter. Investment banking revenue fell 2%.In contrast with weak trading results, the retail side was stronger. Lending revenue rose 17%, and consumer and business banking revenue grew 15%.The bank had a reserve build of $300 million for its credit-card business, although it said the credit environment remained ""benign"" and that demand for credit remained solid. The reserves are used to cushion against bad loans.""While higher reserve build in Card may give some investors pause, underlying revenue/expense trends were strong,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said in a research note.JPMorgan said that credit-card spending had moderated but remained strong and that engagement for its premium Chase Sapphire Reserve card was also good.But as banking becomes more smartphone-based — JPMorgan active mobile customers jumped 12% in the third quarter — Lake said later in the day that ""branches still matter,"" adding that 75% of the bank's growth in deposits came from customers using branches.Still, she said the bank was keeping pace with customers' changing preferences, and that net for the year, the bank would have 125 fewer branch locations.JPMorgan also said it hadn't seen any specific uptick in fraud following the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX).Meanwhile, Citigroup's EPS climbed 14% to $1.42, better than estimates for $1.32, as revenue rose 2% to $18.17 billion, beating forecasts for $17.85 billion.Fixed-income revenue fell 11% to $2.88 billion, while equity markets revenue rose 10% to $757 million.

141,WFC,"TD Ameritrade (AMTD) just beefed up the usefulness of its new Facebook (FB) Messenger chat bot, announcing Monday that clients can now use the mobile-friendly tool to trade stocks and ETFs.XThey also can use TD Ameritrade's bot for Messenger to make secure deposits to fund their accounts on the move, as well as to receive weekly alerts that summarize stock market action, and access quarterly performance video statements. Chat bots are driven by artificial intelligence (AI) technology and serve as virtual assistants or automated programs that allow corporations to communicate with their customers.TD Ameritrade clients can make stock investments independently — or access live client support to place a trade, the online broker said. The bot does most of the heavy lifting, so the customer merely has to click a single button as the final step.The bot is ""smart enough to recognize intent"" and make recommendations based on user interactions, TD Ameritrade's director of emerging technologies Sunayna Tuteja said in an interview. So if you type in ""FB,"" for example, it anticipates you might want to trade the stock or need help deciding between a market order and limit order, she explained.Until now, customers could only use TD Ameritrade's chat bot service, which launched in August, to view the status of their accounts and stock positions, and to access research and education content.A spokesperson for TD Ameritrade told Investor's Business Daily that one of the chat bot's most popular features since its debut is educational videos — driven by younger people who are just getting started with investing. Yet, she added, the chat bot's appeal cuts across demographics, with Baby Boomers engaging on the platform as frequently as millennial investors.TD Ameritrade's trading fees using the Facebook chat bot will remain the same, the spokesperson said. While the chat bot works both on desktop and mobile devices, the experience is better on the latter because Facebook Messenger is designed to be mobile-first, she added.Shares of TD Ameritrade dipped 0.3% to 48.14 on the stock market today, still in range from a September breakout past 47.36. Among other online brokers, Charles Schwab (SCHW) dipped 0.45% Monday, while E-Trade (ETFC) slipped 1%.

""Brian had all kinds of problems when he came in. I mean, they were not of his own doing, but he had a ton of problems. And he had a lot of rocks to turn over, and it cost a lot of money, and he just set out, step by step, to bring the bank back."" Buffett added that Moynihan had also made moves to cut expenses.Berkshire in August exercised warrants to acquire 700 million shares of BofA, making it the bank's biggest shareholder.

The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Banks and other businesses have been waiting for concrete steps from Washington on tax reform. Shares of big banks flagged over the spring and summer on concerns over whether the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress could come through on tax cuts and deregulation, after intrigue over whether the Trump team colluded with Russia to influence last year's election reached a fever pitch.Bank executives in recent months have also, politely or not so politely, expressed their support for tax reform.Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, on the bank's third-quarter earnings call last week, said that ""while tax reform remains a question mark, we do like the direction the administration is going in terms of regulation, which we see as just a course to accommodate higher growth rather than a full-scale regulatory repeal agenda.""Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, during the company's third-quarter earnings call, also last week, was similarly measured.""Our commercial clients continue to perform well. They continue to remain optimistic,"" he said. ""They continue to look forward to continue implementation of a pro-growth agenda, particularly focused on meaningful tax reform.""JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, in July, delivered a broadside against U.S. political gridlock and the country's inability to adopt policies that spur stronger growth.He said that ""somehow, this great American free-enterprise system, we no longer get it"" and that it was ""almost an embarrassment, being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country.""RELATED:Here's How Rivals Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Are DivergingJPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformStrong Retail Banking Lifts BofA; Wells Fargo Revenue Misses

156,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) said employees created two-thirds more bogus accounts than initially thought, a sign the bank is still struggling to move past a scandal that sparked record fines and congressional investigations.An outside review found an additional 1.4 million potentially unauthorized deposit and credit-card accounts opened when the bank was encouraging employees to sell multiple products to retail customers, bringing the total to about 3.5 million, according to a statement Thursday from the San Francisco-based firm. The revised estimate covers January 2009 to September 2016, almost twice as long as the period examined in the initial review.The disclosure of even more fraudulent accounts threatens to catapult Wells Fargo back into the political cross hairs just as Congress returns Sept. 5 from its summer recess. The scandal came to light almost a year ago after regulators slapped Wells Fargo with fines of $185 million over its sales practices, prompting congressional hearings and resulting in the bank naming new leaders, clawing back executives' pay and beginning an overhaul of its retail division.""New data should cause some lawmakers to re-engage on the issue,"" Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading, said before the new tally was announced. Democrats will again argue that it proves Washington needs to keep rules tight on financial firms, while Republicans will continue to fault Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officials for not spotting the misconduct themselves, Boltansky said.Wells Fargo shares fell 0.3% to 51.20 in morning trade before the opening bell in the stock market today.Wells Fargo agreed to expand its review after Washington lawmakers lambasted the company following former Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf's testimony last September about the bank's sales practices. Under pressure, the bank agreed to review records dating back to 2009, rather than through 2011 as it initially did.The company said it has paid or identified $10.7 million in customer compensation related to the investigation.

It also includes $3.7 million related to what it described as the ""complaints process/mediation.""""Today's announcement is a reminder of the disappointment that we caused to our customers and stakeholders,"" CEO Tim Sloan said on a conference call Thursday with reporters. ""We apologize to everyone who was harmed by unacceptable sales practices that occurred in our retail bank.""Democrats led by Rep.

And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote to the Federal Reserve to again press for the removal of board members who served during the original accounts review period of 2011 to 2015.The lender warned investors in March that its initial bogus-accounts estimate was probably too low, saying in its annual filing that a new search by a third-party firm ""could lead to, among other things, an increase in the identified number.""Wells Fargo has worked to minimize the impact of the new tally, describing the additional accounts as those it couldn't rule out from lacking customer authorization. The company said in the statement that it erred on the side of its customers during the review, so the figures might include some accounts that were properly authorized.When it fined Wells Fargo last year, the CFPB ordered the bank to identify all customers affected by its sales misconduct and set aside $5 million for those harmed.Wells Fargo paid $3.26 million to customers covered under that order through June 30, as well as one from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a judgment from the Los Angeles City Attorney, according to the bank's most recent quarterly filing. In August, Sloan said refunds and payments to affected customers and others he didn't identify were ""exceeding $5 million.""The 2016 analysis found the bank charged $2 million in fees on 85,000 deposit accounts that were probably opened without authorization, according to the CFPB's order. About 14,000 bogus credit-card accounts were billed approximately $403,000, the agency said.The new review doesn't go back as far as 2002, the year that executives first knew about the sales misconduct and fired employees over it, according to investigators hired by the company's board. Lawyers representing customers who said they were harmed by the bank's abusive sales practices claimed in a lawsuit that Wells Fargo employees probably created 3.5 million bogus accounts starting in May 2002. Wells Fargo is awaiting final approval to settle that case for $142 million.

The ETF climbed 3% after breaking out from a prior flat base to its Aug. 8 intraday high, and 6% from a breakout early this year.The $271.4 million fund, which tracks the Nasdaq US Rising Dividend Achievers Index, will mark its fourth anniversary in January. The index is comprised of 50 companies that have a history of raising their dividends and are expected to do so in the future.

159,WFC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average pared overnight losses Friday morning with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida. The U.S. dollar fell for a seventh straight session as Treasury yields neared the key 2% level.XS&P 500 and Dow futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat against fair value. The major market averages are trading modestly below all-time highs and slightly above their 50-day moving averages. The euro rose to its highest levels vs. the greenback in nearly three years while the Japanese yen set a 10-year highs. Gold futures continued to advance. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a 10-month low of2.03% after a sharp drop on Thursday.Not coincidentally, bank stocks were big losers on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) undercut a buy point, the SPDR Financial (XLF) bank ETF, fell below its 200-day line and industry leader Citigroup (C) dropped below its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) knifed below its 200-day moving avergage while Wells Fargo (WFC) and several superregional bank stocks hit 2017 lows.The current retreat is just one reason to steer clear of bank stocks. Hopes for tax cuts and other Trump agenda items continue to fade. Interest rates and yield spreads have steadily declined. And over the long term, bank stocks have not outperformed. The case for avoiding bank stocks was clear at the end of May; the evidence is even stronger today.Bank stocks briefly outperformed in late 2016, especially following President Trump's election win. But since early 2017 most banks began to follow the market, with clear underperformance in recent weeks, with several signals along the way.Bank stocks rallied after Election Day in part on hopes for sweeping tax cuts, which would lower their own IRS checks as well as bolster economic growth and interest rates, and accelerate Federal Reserve rate hikes. But the odds and timing of a tax hike have steadily declined, with Goldman Sachs now predicting that the odds of tax reform are down to 40%. On the positive front, the Trump administration is still making moves to ease crisis-era financial regulations, potentially freeing up capital for lending and buybacks.With the Trump agenda stalling, Treasury yields have been sliding for weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply on Thursday to fresh 2017 lows, in part due to euro gains on European Central Bank hints of tapering asset purchases. The yield is at its lowest levels since Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the spread between short-term and long-term yields has been falling sharply. That's bad news for banks, whose traditional profit model is borrowing short and lending long. It's also not a great sign for the economy when the yield curve flattens out.Bank stocks can be solid investments over certain periods, including right after the election. But they haven't tended to outperform the S&P 500 index significantly over time. Citigroup has been the best-performing U.S. bank stock in 2017, but its Relative Strength line is back about where it was at the start of the year. That means that Citi is trading even with the S&P 500 index. Looking further back, JPMorgan has been one of the better financials, but its shares haven't been long-term outperformers.Investors might be better off buying a broad index fund or ETF, which often will have financials as big holdings, to provide similar performance without the sector or single-stock risk.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Hold Serve, But Banks Face Break PointFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksThese 5 Dow Titans Are Near Buys In Bullish BasesTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stock News

160,WFC,"Shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks were pulled lower on Tuesday by sinking bond yields, which have reached their lowest point since just before the presidential election.XThe slide followed reports in recent days that North Korea had tested a hydrogen bomb and could be planning a test of another intercontinental ballistic missile.

Those stocks were all below their 50-day lines after testing support at the key metric last week. Wells Fargo (WFC), which has crumbled as it deals with a widening fake account scandal, fell 1.7% on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.07% on Tuesday, hitting the lowest levels since the presidential election. The 10-year yield helps set the value of different types of credit and is seen as a gauge of investors' longer-term inflation expectations. Meanwhile the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields hit a 1-year low.Yields spiked following the election on hopes President Trump's plans to grow the economy would push inflation higher and lead the Fed to more aggressively raise interest rates — a move the banks would match by hiking their own interest rates on loans.Higher interest rates and wider yield spreads can help banks on the top and bottom lines. But the stocks have leveled off over the past few months as banks temper their financial outlooks.RELATED:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisDow Retakes 22,000 Level Thanks To GE, Strength In FinancialsBofA, Goldman Beat But See Trading, Net Interest Income Weakness

Trump will delay the action for six months so Congress can work on legislation to codify the protections President Barack Obama created in 2012.""Congress, get ready to do your job — DACA!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.Many business leaders argued for keeping the program by underscoring the economic contributions made by immigrants, many of whom are employed by the largest companies in the U.S. Some called on Congress to pass new legislation, while others threatened legal action.""Wells Fargo (WFC) believes young, undocumented immigrants brought to America as children should have the opportunity to stay,"" Jennifer Dunn, a spokeswoman for the bank, wrote in an email.

Among retailers, Best Buy (BBY) CEO Hubert Joly asked Congress to act in support of DACA, while Under Armour (UAA) tweeted that it ""stands with America and the #DREAMers.

Refineries could be shut for several weeks. Gas Buddy said the national gasoline average jumped by over 11 cents per gallon from the prior week with more price hikes on the way. U.S. crude futures fell as fewer refiners were available to convert oil to gasoline and other products. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels in the latest week with gasoline supplies flat, the Energy Information Administration reported, but that doesn't reflect Harvey's impact. Domestic production was essentially flat at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015.Two days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion, or $180 a share, for Kite Pharma (KITE) and pivot to cellular therapies, Novartis (NVS) was the first to grab FDA approval for a CAR-T treatment. Kymriah was OK'd to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. But Kite's drug is expected to be approved this fall to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

163,WFC,"Charity: Disasters like the one unfolding in Houston show the worst in Mother Nature, but also show the best of a free society. Even before any government agency could act, volunteers, private businesses and charities from around the country were organizing relief efforts.There has been plenty of attention given to how well the government — particularly the federal government — is responding to the unfolding disaster in Houston. President Trump's tweet praising FEMA's response, for example, was instant news. But while there's no doubt that marshaling government resources in a time of crisis is vital, all this attention on government activities overlooks the far more important and inspiring voluntary efforts across the country.Over the weekend, dozens of people from Louisiana showed up in Houston as part of what's become known as the Cajun Navy. This is an all-volunteer group formed during Hurricane Katrina that has grown in size since.XThe Cajun Navy was part of what's been described as an ""armada of private boats"" that came to Houston to help rescue thousands of people stranded in their homes by Harvey's relentless deluge.Nobody ordered it, or organized it, or coordinated it, or directed it. Nobody's getting paid. But their efforts are a big reason why the death rate from Harvey has been so low.It's just one of many stories emerging from Houston that show how, in times of crisis, Americans come together, on their own, to help each other, save lives, and solve problems. A few examples:There are less obvious ways private companies help. Waffle House, for example, has become an indicator of how bad a weather disaster is, because the restaurant chain is so determined to keep operating in the worst conditions.Rory Carroll, writing for the UK-based Guardian newspaper about the outpouring of voluntary help in response to Harvey, put it this way: ""Here was the America of the ideal: one nation, indivisible. A republic of citizens looking out for each other. No politics or polarization. No fake news or social media bubbles. A crisis all could see, and a response all wanted to be part of.""Amen to that. The nation's moral character isn't measured by the number of federal programs, or how big their budgets are, or how many bureaucrats are involved. It is measured in the willingness of its citizens to rally, organize and respond to a crisis all on their own, freely donating their time and resources, experience and know-how to help strangers in need. Too, often, these private efforts get lost in the relentless focus on what government is or isn't doing.For all the terrible news to come out of Houston, the response from individuals, communities and businesses around the country is a beautiful thing to behold.Of course, not everyone has been inclined to see the good emerging from the Harvey tragedy.Chauncey Devega of the left-wing Salon, for example, could not contain his Trump bashing even for a moment, writing in a truly awful column about how ""many Americans face a massive natural disaster — but the disaster of this failed presidency is even worse.""Salon should send Devega to Houston so he can see what America is really about.RELATED:Hurricane Harvey's Nationalized Insurance Nightmare

Wells Fargo (WFC), still trying to bounce back from the fake accounts scandal, is building the right side of a base.Citigroup (C), already extended from buy range, and still-basing Goldman Sachs (GS) also were among those getting price target hikes.The U.S.' largest banks stand to benefit from better global growth, with interest rates set to drift higher as many central banks signal a winding down of easy monetary policy, Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell said in a research note.""After years of fits and starts ... we now seem to be experiencing synchronous global economic growth for the first time since the financial crisis,"" he wrote.Other long-term positives, he said, included a recent Treasury Department report that ""indicates to us that significant benefits from deregulation are increasingly likely.""The Treasury Department, in a report last month, called for broad regulatory rollbacks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said about 80% of those potential changes could be done via regulators, according to Reuters.The payout hikes following the results last month from the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, Mitchell said, also showed ""a clear path toward reducing excess capital"".""Given these potential tailwinds (combined with positive optionality on a corporate tax cut), we see multiple expansion potential for the group and recommend investors be buyers on dips,"" Mitchell said.Still, Mitchell lowered his second-quarter earnings-per-share estimates for 10 banks by a median 2.4%, citing tamer fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading.The absence of market-turning events, like last year's Brexit vote in the U.K. or President Trump's election in the U.S., contributed to a quieter trading environment for the big banks during the second quarter.JPMorgan, whose target price was raised to 100 from 94 by Buckingham, fell 0.3% to 93.38 in the stock market today after setting a record 94.51 intraday.

169,WFC,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting. Fidelity added exposure to big banks Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) by boosting share counts 4.4% and 3.8% respectively.But Fidelity cut share counts in Goldman Sachs (GS) by 9.8%, in Morgan Stanley (MS) by 8.1%, in Wells Fargo (WFC) by 7.9%, and in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 7.5%.It also trimmed share count in credit card network Mastercard (MA) by 2.2%.The $39.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) and $22.7 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) both held top-10 positions in Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) as of June 30, Rosenbluth reported.TIPS & TOOLS:Is this a good time to buy Fidelity's top holdings?

He pointed out that the Shanghai Composite cleared resistance at the 3,300 level for the first time since January 2016.Retail, homebuilders and energy were among the biggest sector gainers. Oil also fared well with VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) up 1.5% and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) adding 0.3%. Biotech and chips were among the few losers.Gold ETFs perked up as the yellow metal's futures climbed 0.4% to $1,297.50. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) rose 0.6% each. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Trust (IAU) and PowerShares DB Gold Fund (DGL) were up about 0.5% apiece.A pair of big-cap equity funds with stakes in three of Warren Buffett's biggest holdings are seeking support.Plenty of exchange traded funds have been pulling back to their 50-day moving average lines as the market has come off record highs.SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) has been trading near its 50-day the past week. It advanced nearly 4% from its last definitive bounce off the support line July 11 to its July 27 intraday high.The $871 million fund, which tracks the index bearing the same name, will mark its 17th anniversary next month. It provides exposure to the companies in the S&P 500 with the strongest growth characteristics based on sales growth, earnings change to price ratio, and momentum.That's led it to top five holdings in large-cap techs: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Billionaire investor Buffett upped his stake in Apple in Q2. Other big Buffett stocks in SPYG include American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO).Technology, at 36%, leads SPYG in terms of sector weighting as of Aug. 23. Consumer discretionary and health care make up about 16% each, followed by 11% in industrials.The ETF has outpaced the S&P 500 year to date through Aug. 23 with a 15.8% vs. 10.6% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. It's also topped the benchmark index over the longer haul. A 15-year average annual return of 8.9% edged past the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. SPYG carries a 0.15% expense ratio.Pacer Trendpilot 750 (PTLC), which tracks the Pacer Wilshire US Large-Cap Trendpilot Index, is also looking for support at its 50-day line. The two-year-old fund has attracted $530.2 million in assets. Its expense ratio is 0.62%.The Pacer Trendpilot series tries to avoid market downturns by paring exposure and investing in three-month U.S. Treasury bills if the underlying index closes below its 200-day average for five straight days. Likewise, if the underlying index closes above its 200-day line for five straight days, the funds will be fully invested in equities.PTLC's top holdings include the same techs as SPYG. It also owns the same Buffett stocks, as well as the two other Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) top-five positions: Kraft-Heinz (KHC) and Wells Fargo (WFC). The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 22 were technology at 20%, financial services 16%, health care 13.5%, and consumer cyclical 11%.The ETF has performed roughly in line with the S&P 500.

172,WFC,"Investors will look to quarterly filings from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), George Soros' Soros Fund Management, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital, Dan Loeb's Third Point and other closely followed hedge funds — days after Warren Buffett's conglomerate reported results.XBerkshire's operating profits plunged 10.6% to $4.12 billion in the second quarter as lower investment gains and insurance underwriting losses offset improvements in its railroad business, it reported Friday.Over the past quarter, Berkshire Hathaway and its units made several key strategic moves to diversify its business and seize promising opportunities. Those initiatives included an agreement to buy Dallas-based power transmitter Oncor Electric Delivery for $9 billion; a 10% stake in Store Capital Group (STOR), a real estate investment trust or REIT that has rallied since Buffett's investment; and the rescue of a Canadian mortgage lender, Home Capital Group.The company ended the June quarter with about $99.7 billion of cash and equivalents, plus big stakes in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Apple (AAPL) and Coca-Cola (KO). It bought just over $3 billion of stocks in the quarter, Reuters reported, while it is poised to become Bank of America's (BAC) biggest shareholder thanks to a shrewd investment six years ago.Class-B shares of Berkshire Hathaway closed down 1% at 178.04 on the stock market today, snapping a 15-day win streak that was capped with a 52-week high of 179.99 Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The latest list of new buys of top-performing mutual funds shows strong demand for certain sectors and can also be used for stock investment ideas. Berkshire's rapid accumulation of Apple stock over the past year has been among its most notable portfolio moves.In Q1 2016, Berkshire had 9.8 million Apple shares, and that position grew to 15.2 million in Q2 2016, and ballooned to 57.4 million by Q4. In Q1 this year, Berkshire more than doubled its stake to 129.4 million.Berkshire's Apple purchases have coincided with dips amid concerns about slowing iPhone sales. But the legendary billionaire investor saw buy opportunities, and recently described Apple's resonance with customers as ""amazing"" and the iPhone as a ""sticky"" product.Apple shares ended Q2 of this year essentially unchanged vs. the start of Q2. But since Q3 has started, the stock has climbed into a new buy zone, helped by strong quarterly earnings and guidance.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Two Best Q1 Bets Include One He Didn't MakeStocks Edge Higher: Apple Retakes Buy Point; China Name Breaks Out

173,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday said that it may uncover many more fake accounts as part of an expanded review into a scandal that surfaced publicly last year and plagued the bank ever since.XThe bank also said that potential legal expenses could exceed reserves.In a regulatory filing, the bank said that the expanded review — which broadens the investigation to encompass accounts from 2009 to 2016 as well as findings from a consulting firm that looked into the matter — could lead to a ""significant increase in the identified number of potentially unauthorized accounts.""Wells Fargo said the efforts were unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's finances.Shares closed down 1.05% to 52.84 on the stock market today but had lost as much as 2.8% earlier.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was up 1.3% to 93.66, at the very edge of a 5% chase zone from an 89.23 double-bottom base.Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.5% to 24.97, closing in on a 25.21 buy point. Citigroup (C) added 1.2% to 68.96.The company said it expected to wrap up the review by the end of the third quarter. The company also said that a review intended to evaluate the bank's structure and practices was ""expected to result in actions"" that the board would announce during the period.Another review intended to identify customers who were harmed by unwanted products was expected to conclude by the end of Q3.

174,WFC,"Like most other sectors, financials got hammered Thursday as the broader market sold off. They continued lower Friday, even as the broad stock market indexes rallied.XAhead of Thursday's rout, the top three U.S. financial funds outperformed the S&P 500 based on their year-to-date returns through Aug. 8. However, they all lag the benchmark index over the past three and five years.Leading the group is iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN), with a year-to-date gain of 26.7% through Aug. 8, more than double the S&P 500's 11.9% return. The ETF's 4% rise for the month also led the top performers (see table below).EUFN, which tracks the MSCI Europe Financials Index, has attracted $1.7 billion in assets since its January 2010 launch. Shares dipped the past three sessions and may be heading toward a potential test of the 50-day moving average line.The U.K. was its biggest exposure as of Aug. 9, at nearly 29% of assets. France was next with about 12%, followed by Switzerland, Spain and Germany at roughly 11% each. The biggest holdings included the U.K.'s HSBC Holdings (HSBC), Spain's Banco Santander (SAN), Allianz of Germany and France's BNP Paribas (BNP). The top 10 stocks accounted for 44% of assets.IShares Global Financials (IXG) came in second with a 15.8% YTD performance — and a 3.3% gain for its monthly return. It too may soon test support at its 50-day line.The $464.8 million fund, which marks its 16th anniversary in November, tracks the S&P Global 1200 Financials Sector Index. The U.S. weighed in with 44% of assets, with the U.K. and Canada a distant second and third at 8% and 7%, respectively. Australia and Japan made up 6% and 5%.Half of its top 10 holdings were U.S.-based: Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C). Others in the top 10 included HSBC, Banco Santander and Allianz. The top 10 stocks accounted for 28% of assets.Both EUFN and IXG carry a 0.48% expense ratio.SPDR S&P Capital Markets (KCE) has returned 13.7% this year through Aug. 8. It sank just below its 50-day line Thursday as the U.S. stock market sold off. If it can make a solid rebound, that could set up a buy opportunity. But the market uptrend is under pressure, which increases risk of all purchases.The $108 million fund, which will turn 12 in November, tracks the KBW Capital Markets Index. Its top holdings included Ameriprise Financial (AMP), T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) and TD Ameritrade Holding (AMTD). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of assets were invested in the top 10 names. Its expense ratio is 0.35%.RELATED:These 3 Europe-Tracking ETFs Climb Near Buy PointsIs It Safe To Invest In European Financials?

177,WFC,"Stocks rumbled to a solid finish Friday in a week that left two of the three major indexes at fresh highs and the other with its strongest performance of the year.The Nasdaq seized a 0.6% gain, with NetApp (NTAP) and Seagate Technology (STX) leading the Nasdaq 100. Apple (AAPL) rose 0.9% to end flush with its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 clocked a 0.5% advance, while the Dow Jones industrial average steered 0.4% higher.For the week, the Nasdaq nailed a 2.6% advance to lodge its best week since early December, and ending within three points of its June 9 high. The S&P 500 climbed 1.4%, moving to a new high, while the Dow industrials swung up 1% to ace another fresh high.Among the Dow's stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) duked it out for the top slot. Microsoft closed just below a 72.99 buy point after rising as high as 73.27 intraday in average volume from a flat base. Wal-Mart's fourth-straight advance positioned it for a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.Among IBD 50 stocks, China's YY Inc. (YY) was the highflier, up 9% in big trade. That left shares still in buy range above two alternative buy points in a flat base, an aggressive one at 60.94 and a regular one at 61.62.NetApp led a rebound among data storage names, surging 5.5% in weighty trade to break out past a 43.24 buy point and nail a new high. Other names in the group include Seagate Technology, which popped 3% in mild trade.Retail and banking groups posted nearly all of Friday's worst losses among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. High-end names like RH (RH) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) led the declines in the worst-hit home furnishings retail group. Group 1 (GPI) and Penske Automotive (PAG) paced the downside among the session's hard-hit auto dealerships.Big banks including JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) sharply trimmed their early losses after reporting quarter results, but the selling had already spread to the superregional and regional banking groups. A softer than expected rise in core consumer prices for June further eased pressure on the Fed to press for the additional rate hikes that are already valued into many banking stocks.Gold miners and solar energy plays were Friday's top advancers among industries.China receives official estimates for second-quarter GDP as well as June industrial production and retail sales late Sunday, which could affect U.S. trade to start the week.

179,WFC,"The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials all rose slightly Thursday, with more stocks setting up new possible entries within sound bases. Here are six big-cap stocks that are within 1% of buy points: Amgen (AMGN), General Motors (GM), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), ASML (ASML) and PNC Financial Services (PNC).XGeneral Motors has a $54 billion market cap, and that's the smallest of the six, with Visa No. 1 at $200 billion. Amgen, GM, Mastercard and ASML all edged past entry points intraday, but closed beneath them.The market uptrend is under pressure, with earnings season kicking into high gear. So investors should be especially cautious about taking on new positions now.Amgen rose 1% to 175.04 in Thursday stock market trading. The biotech's stock rose as high as 176.20, briefly passing a 175.55 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but couldn't hold that level. Volume was below normal, though the highest in three weeks.Amgen hasn't been a market leader lately. Its relative strength line is well off recent highs, as Amgen lags the S&P 500 index. And several other biotechs, including Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN), have already broken out.General Motors rose as high as 36.12 Thursday afternoon, briefly passing a 36.10 cup-with-handle entry. GM settled with a 1% gain at 35.86 in slightly above-average volume. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) cleared buy points Thursday, following a move by Ferrari (RACE) on Wednesday.General Motors' RS line has been lagging. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales have peaked, though a shift to SUV and truck purchases is supporting profits.Visa climbed to 96.65 intraday, a new all-time high, but not quite triggering the 96.70 buy point from a flat base. Visa reversed to closed down 0.25% at 95.94.Mastercard edged up 19 cents to 125.47, rising intraday to 126.40, briefly topping the 126.29 flat-base entry.Volume was below average for both Visa and Mastercard, but their RS lines are near highs, reflecting their strong performance and short consolidations.However, several other payment stocks have broken out this week, including PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ).Visa has earnings next week, along with a few other card firms such as American Express (AXP), which is still in range from a June breakout.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial could provide insight into credit card trends Friday with their second-quarter earnings reports and conference calls.The chip-equipment giant fell 0.1% to 136.85. But for the second straight day ASML inched past a 137.37 buy point in a flat base going back nearly two months. ASML's RS line is near highs, a good sign.ASML will report quarterly earnings next week.PNC Financial is a superregional bank. It may be overshadowed by the money center banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, but PNC is expected to deliver a 10% EPS gain, while its larger rivals deliver essentially flat profit. PNC rose 0.1% to 127.38, as it builds toward a 128.35 entry in a shallow cup-with-handle base.JPMorgan is still in range from a double-bottom base, while Citigroup is extended. Wells Fargo is close to a buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern.RELATED:The Big Picture: Analyzing Apple's Stock; 3 Big Bank Earnings DuePeak Auto?

180,WFC,"Stocks advanced, with the Nasdaq composite retaking support and the Dow Jones industrial average claiming a fresh high. Fed chief Janet Yellen helped. Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day was a success, but Target (TGT) showed some strength. Facebook (FB) hit a record high as Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) hit a new low. Fiber-optic plays jumped, while PayPal (PYPL) and payment stocks broke out. The first wave of bank earnings, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) led the first wave of bank earnings.XThe Nasdaq composite rose 2.6%, its best weekly gain of 2017, retaking its 50-day moving average and continuing on. The S&P 500 rose 1% and the Dow industrials 1.4%, but both hit record high. A somewhat dovish Fed chief Janet Yellen helped lift the market. FANG stocks rebounded, retaking key levels, while energy stocks climbed on oil prices.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) reported better-than-expected earnings Friday morning, but JPMorgan's net interest margins and loan growth weren't as strong as expected. Wells Fargo (WFC) also topped on EPS, but revenue came in light. Shares of all three banks fell Friday.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that inflation was only partially due to short-term factors, while signaling that the central bank is in no hurry interest rates. She did say that she expects to reduce the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet ""appreciably"" over time. Meanwhile, June retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.2%, though May's decline was revised up somewhat. Consumer inflation also remained tame.Yellen's commentary and economic data pushed U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar lower.Amazon (AMZN) made its Prime Day shopping festival into another blockbuster, with sales up 60% from the year ago period for the 30-hour event. Amazon called it ""the biggest day ever"" in company history and said a record number of Prime members shopped across 13 countries. It also scored a victory on subscriptions to its Amazon Prime loyalty program and cited strong Echo smart speaker sales. Amazon shares rose 2.3% this week, retaking their 50-day moving average.RELATED:Amazon Prime Day Sales Rocket 60%, Setting New RecordAmazon is starting a home appliances repair service, seen as possible step toward competing with Geek Squad service from Best Buy (BBY).

Meanwhile, an Amazon shell page for ""Hire A Realtor"" was spotted. Amazon took down the page for now, but real estate information site Zillow (Z) fell 4% on Wednesday, below its 50-day moving average, but the stock rebounded to close up 2 cents to 46.52 for the week.RELATED:Amazon Mulls Move Into Real Estate, Knocking This Top StockBest Buy Stock A Bestseller Monday As Amazon Crafts Geek Squad RivalFacebook (FB) climbed 5.6% to a record high.

PayPal did not disclose terms of the deal, such as any revenue-sharing with Apple. Apple has enabled iPhone and iPad users to make purchases using credit card networks and bank debit cards. PayPal users will be able to buy apps, music, movies, TV shows, and books, as well as Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage. A Loop Capital analyst, meanwhile, said in a report that PayPal should acquire Square (SQ), sending that stock in to a buy zone. When eBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal in 2015, there was also speculation it could target Square. Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) cleared buy points on Friday, helped by big banks' commentary on consumer lending. Visa reports earnings next week.RELATED:Second Payment Stock Breaks Out, This Time On Apple DealThis Top Payment Stock Is In A Buy Zone; Analyst Says PayPal Should Buy ItOil prices rallied during the week, though still well below $50 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.6 million barrels but domestic production rose to 9.397 million barrels per day up from 9.338 million barrels in the prior week. The EIA also cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.9 million bpd. OPEC expects demand for its oil next year to fall by 60,000 bpd to 32.2 million bpd as non-OPEC supply is seen climbing by 1.14 million bpd to 58.96 million bpd. OPEC compliance to its production cut deal fell to 78%, the lowest rate this year, according to an International Energy Agency report. But an earlier IEA report warned that shale drilling won't be enough to offset the drop in conventional drilling investment, which just hit its lowest mark in 70 years. IEA said a supply squeeze could be on the horizon.Shares in optical component makers rallied after Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) preannounced June-quarter profit and revenue above its earlier guidance and consensus estimates. Applied Optoelectronics shot up 25% for the week. Lumentum Holdings (LITE), Finisar (FNSR), and Oclaro (OCLR) all rallied Thursday. Applied Optoelectronics customers include Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), which are upgrading data centers to superfast communications for cloud-based services. China remains a wild card for the telecom-fiber optics group. China's market was a bright spot last year as telecoms upgraded optical technologies for both 4G wireless networks and landline broadband services but demand has weakened. Some analysts expect a rebound in late 2017.Acacia Communications (ACIA) preannounced weak Q2 results, citing manufacturing woes.

Higher costs hurt the carrier's estimate-missing Q2 results and were seen by some analysts as holding back margin growth in Q3. Delta indicated that the worst of its unit-cost troubles are behind it. Delta also touted its efforts to divide up the flight cabin into different fare classes with different amenities, saying that could drive profits. Management added that the addition of larger jets would allow them to offer more premium services. Delta shares fell 1.8% on Thursday but was down just 0.6%. Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) released solid June traffic and Q2 unit revenue guidance, with United reporting earnings this coming week.Once-seemingly-untouchable stock Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continues its descent, cutting its 200-day line on Monday in the wake of a Wall Street Journal report that said major department stores are discounting prestige beauty products. Ulta was not named as a discounter but the report perhaps flustered investor confidence in the beauty space. Ulta fell 5.5% for the week. High-end cosmetics maker Estee Lauder (EL) dipped but recovered by week's end. Meanwhile, fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) dropped 5.6% on a sell rating from MKM Partners and 26 price target.RELATED:Macy's Hits 7-Year Low, Ulta Slices 200-Day As Beauty Gets OldThe Air Force said that the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 is the most cost-effective way to modernize its aging fighter platforms, a day after Congress was warned of the program's rising costs in a Selected Acquisition Report submitted Monday. Acquisition costs for the platform are seen rising to $406.5 billion from $379 billion currently as the Air Force extends its acquisition time frame by six years. Total program costs are seen rising nearly 2% to $1.53 trillion. Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) successfully intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time. So far the system has a perfect record in tests since 2005. The State Department approved the sale of Raytheon (RTN) Patriot defense systems along with nearly 170 Lockheed PAC-3 missiles to NATO partner Romania. The $3.9 billion deal still needs congressional approval.National Beverage (FIZZ), maker of La Croix sparkling water and other beverages, fell 8.4% on Thursday to close right at its 96.15 buy point. That's despite a 68% earnings per share gain and better-than-expected sales growth. National Beverage, which broke out of a short base on July 7, did rebound 4.7% on Friday. Much-larger PepsiCo (PEP) reported an 11% EPS gain as revenue climbed 2% to $15.71 billion.

182,WFC,"U.S. stock indexes rushed upward at the opening bell Wednesday and built on the gains in midday action. New highs included Caterpillar (CAT), a Dow Jones industrial average component; Jagged Peak Energy (JAG) from IBD's IPO Leaders screen and smart home software provider and IBD 50 name Control4 (CTRL).XThe mix of new highs from both enduring and innovative spaces is a sign of strength.The small cap Russell 2000 zoomed 0.9% higher, and the Nasdaq matched the gain. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges, reversing a recent trend. Up days have been coming in falling volume and down days in rising volume — the opposite of what bulls prefer to see. But Wednesday's strong price moves in higher volume served as red meat for the optimists.Finding losers was a challenge. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, winners led losers by a 47-to-1 ratio. Food and dairy products led the losers, and even that was a good sign. Generally, food is considered a defensive niche.Computer-related groups and oil stocks were notching big gains.Two items appeared to be reviving the bulls. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in her prepared remarks told Congress that the U.S. economy was strong enough to handle gradual rate hikes.But banks, which are expected to benefit from higher interest rates, were mixed. Citigroup (C), which is extended about 7% from a 62.63 buy point, edged up 0.1%.  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  slipped 0.3%. JPMorgan is about 2% below a 94.08 buy point, but is about 4% above an alternate entry at 89.23.Why the muted reaction among bank stocks? Part of the reason might be earnings season. On Friday, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial (PNC) will report Q2 results.The second item was oil. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose 1.22 to 46.26. The Energy Information Administration reported a drop of 7.6 million barrels in the week ended July 7. Analysts at S&P Global Platts had expected a decline of 2.6 million barrels.

184,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who is prone to moments of bluntness and irritation on earnings calls, railed against what he characterized as growing U.S. bureaucracy, litigiousness, and an inability to modernize infrastructure, while other countries adopt measures intended to unlock growth.X""It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies that promote business and growth is good for the average citizen of those countries for jobs and wages, and that somehow, this great American free-enterprise system, we no longer get it,"" he told analysts Friday.When asked at what point dysfunction in Washington, D.C., starts to hurt confidence and frustrate clients, Dimon said that JPMorgan has managed to grow ""in spite of stupidity and political gridlock"" since the recession because the U.S. economy's fundamentals were still intact.But the contrast with other nations' policies intended to spur growth is wearing on Dimon, while Wall Street continues to wait for the Trump administration to unchain the banks.""It's almost an embarrassment, being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country,"" he said.The remarks came three months after Dimon advised being patient with Trump and just after the bank reported strong second-quarter results. Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported on Friday.While JPMorgan's results beat analyst views, the bank's outlook has dimmed. The company lowered its full-year forecast for net-interest income growth — to around $4 billion from $4.5 billion — and signaled that tough comparisons for trading remained on the horizon. The bank also sees core loan growth being ""modestly lower"" than once expected.CFO Marianne Lake reminded analysts on the call that the third quarter for trading last year was particularly strong. That wasn't ""guidance,"" she said, but it was ""context.""The big banks had already warned that trading would be weak for the second quarter, partly because of a lack of what Lake has called ""idiosyncratic events,"" such as the U.K.'s vote last year to leave the European Union and President Trump's surprise election, which jolted trading activity last year.Lake also characterized the Fed's unwinding of its balance sheet as ""a downside risk, not a probability.""Shares of JPMorgan closed down 0.9% at 92.25 in the stock market today. The stock is in range from a double-bottom base buy point of 89.23. Weak retail sales and consumer price index data also weighed on bond yields, which in turn weigh on banks because they can serve as a gauge for inflation expectations. Citigroup fell 0.45% to 66.72, and Wells Fargo dropped 1.1% to 54.99.The second quarter was marked not just by weak trading. Lukewarm business-loan growth was also seen, along with lower long-term interest rates, which have tumbled as the Trump administration struggles to push through its economic agenda and tear away financial regulations.JPMorgan reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.82, up 17%, on a 5% revenue increase to $26.405 billion, compared to Zacks estimates for EPS of $1.57 and revenue of $24.84 billion.Markets revenue fell 14%, with fixed-income trading down 19% and equities down 1%.

Consumer and business banking revenue climbed 13%.Citigroup's EPS rose 3% to $1.28, compared to Zacks estimates for $1.21, with revenue up 2% to $17.9 billion, besting views for $17.32 billion. Trading revenue dropped 4%, as fixed-income trading fell 6%, but equity market trading revenue rose 11%. Investment banking revenue jumped 22%. Consumer banking revenue grew 5%.Fixed-income markets were hit by ""lower G10 currencies revenue, given low volatility in the current quarter and the comparison to higher Brexit-related activity a year ago,"" the bank said.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo's EPS rose 6% to $1.07, according to Zacks, topping views for $1.02. Revenue was roughly flat at $22.17 billion, shy of Street forecasts for $22.29 billion. Community banking revenue edged up 0.7% to $12.3 billion. Wholesale banking fell 4.6% to $6.95 billion.

185,WFC,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen told Congress Wednesday morning that the balance sheet will shrink ""appreciably,"" but stock indexes surged as she seemed to cede ground to the doves on the softer inflation trend.Yellen said that the recent decline in core inflation was only ""partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices."" Previously Yellen had implied that the Fed could overlook lower inflation readings as it continued on its rate-hiking path. In a Q&A, she acknowledged the potential for an""undershooting"" of the Fed's 2% inflation target, a signal that future rate hikes will be more data-dependent vs. moving proactively in anticipation of firmer data.The Fed's Beige Book report, released Wednesday afternoon, didn't suggest the central bank should be in a rush to tighten policy further. The report found ""slight to moderate"" economic growth across the country, with inflation and wage gains tame.Yellen's modest shift in tone sent Treasury yields lower Wednesday, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6% to a record high. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.7% 0.8% while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.1% on the stock market today.Bank stocks lagged, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan lost 0.3% and BofA 0.9%, though Wells Fargo rallied to close up 0.2%. Wells and BofA are near buy points.Any concern that Yellen might deliver a hawkish message seemed to melt away on Tuesday afternoon, after one of the Fed's leading doves, Lael Brainard, stole Yellen's thunder.Brainard said that she's on board with the Fed's plan to begin normalizing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. But before the Fed hikes rates again, Brainard wants to implement the change in reinvestment policy and wait for more clarity on the path of core inflation after the disinflationary trend of the past few months.Yellen is unlikely to seek a fight with the Fed's dovish wing as they wait for clearer signals about inflation. There's no real urgency to do so, with the Fed getting ready to incrementally adjust its current posture of reinvesting all principal from its maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that a paring of the balance sheets by the Fed and other central banks could be a ""little more disruptive than people think."" JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo report earnings on Friday, with Bank of America next week.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on whether the flashing-yellow market trend turns green.At the moment, there's a disconnect between the Fed's hawkish signal of four rate hikes over the next 18 months and market pricing for just one hike (in December) through mid-2018, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.""In my view, the neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain close to zero in real terms over the medium term. If that is the case, we would not have much more additional work to do on moving to a neutral stance,"" Brainard said.Technology stocks have been under pressure the past two weeks as the Fed and European Central Bank both getting ready to reduce the impact of their bond-buying programs.RELATED:Yellen May Trigger Stocks, Banks; Amazon Reviews: Investing Action PlanStrong Job Growth Signals Economic Momentum; September Rate Hike In PlayDraghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market Support

186,WFC,"Bulls raked in some small gains midday Friday, as the stock market failed to gain much traction from big banks' earnings beats.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 inched up 0.1%. Volume in the stock market was down vs. the previous session's pace.XJPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported quarterly results before the open, topping the Street's consensus view on earnings by 15%. Revenue continued to rise at single-digit pace, up 8%. Wells Fargo (WFC) beat views by almost 6%, and Citigroup (C) by 5%, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.Despite the favorable performance, the market found reasons for pessimism. JPMorgan's trading revenue fell 14%, which was worse than what analysts estimated. For Wells Fargo, the negative niche was the mortgage business, which fell about 19%. Citigroup's problem was weakness in the credit-card space.This bent toward finding the flaw in the details and ignoring the overall increases is a sign of stock-market weakness. In a stronger market, the flaws are brushed off. Pressure on the uptrend hasn't been lifted, and the negative reaction of bank stocks confirmed it.Along with banks, retail stocks were among the day's losers.Upscale home furnisher RH (RH) dropped more than 8% in fast trade before cutting losses slightly. After bottoming in February, RH broke out of an awkward-looking consolidation in June. The stock is now about 9% above a 60.21 buy point. The Street expects RH to deliver a 44% earnings-per-share gain to $1.82 in fiscal 2018 ending in January. The stock has a 95 Composite Rating, which puts RH in the top 5 percentile among all the stocks in IBD's database. The home furnishings retail group is in the top 20 among 197 industry groups.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) sank 1% in strong volume. The battered stock broke out of a consolidation in late March, advanced 14% in about five weeks, and then round-tripped in June to back under the buy point.Blue chip stocks were mostly up.

189,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial (PNC) are expected to confirm on Friday that financials had a lackluster second quarter, yet bank stocks are near long-time highs.XBanks have largely telegraphed declines in their trading results, which have been hurt by calmer markets and muted client activity. JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake, at a conference in May, said that there had been fewer ""idiosyncratic events"" to jolt trade in Q2 — think recent populist agitation like Brexit or President Trump's election — and that more such incidents were were needed.Other difficulties could hang over the results. The Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes have helped push up short-term interest rates. But long-term interest rates also fell during the quarter as doubts grew over Trump's ability to carry out an agenda intended to spur long-term growth, a story from Dow Jones noted this month.The banks' earnings, which are expected to be roughly flat except for PNC Financial, will also come after lending activity cooled in the first quarter. Gains in the 10-year Treasury yield — which influences the value of mortgages and other types of credit — slowed for much of the quarter.But bank stocks have been faring well in recent weeks. JPMorgan and Citigroup have hit longtime highs, while Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo and PNC Financial, among others, are near buy points.""July earnings will feel like the middle of the swimming test with 60 seconds of treading water,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a research note. ""You're looking forward to the freestyle sprint up next.""""Deregulation is the next catalyst for the money centers,"" she added, referring to the global money center banks.Analysts' hopes have been raised by a recent Treasury Department report that called for broad financial deregulation  — much of which could be pushed through without congressional approval, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said. Growth could also come as the administration installs people in top regulatory positions who are more sympathetic to the financial industry.Estimates: Wall Street expects earnings per share to increase 1% to $1.57, with revenue rising 2% to $24.483 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, during the bank's first-quarter earnings call, played down the softer trends in loans, saying that companies had options beyond loans to expand, such as deals or bonds.Factors to watch, beyond broader industry trends, include Dimon's take on Brexit, the health of the consumer, and the company's luxury Sapphire Reserve card, said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg in a research note.JPMorgan stock rose 0.6% to 93.10 in Thursday stock market trading, still in range from an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. JPMorgan hit a record intraday high of 94.51 on July 6.EPS is expected to fall 3% to $1.21, with revenue down 1% to $17.320 billion.Goldberg said that Citigroup's investment banking segment has been strong, even in Europe, where recent elections and Brexit have been sources of anxiety. And he said he expected the bank to emphasize the progress of its credit card investments, including a co-branded deal with Costco (COST). Still, questions remain about the write-down Citigroup might take on its deferred tax assets if tax cuts make it through Congress.Citi's results will also come days before the company's first investor day since before the financial crisis.""Its earnings call could serve as a preview to its Investor Day on July 25 (first in over 9 years), where we expect management to lay out a more detailed blueprint to higher investor returns,"" Goldberg said.Shares climbed 10 cents to 67.02. Citi rose to 68.91 on July 3, the highest since January 2009.EPS is seen up 1% to $1.02; revenue is expected to edge up 0.6% to $22.287 billion.Barclays analysts said that the brunt of the fallout from Wells' sham-account scandal — in which reams of fake accounts were created in an attempt to hit sales goals in a high-pressure environment — may be in the past. However, the firm said that bad press could still ""persist for some time.""Others suggest that if the bank turns out strong loan growth, those troubles could shrink further into the past.""For WFC, we expect a rebound in loan growth will help buoy investor concerns about lost business momentum at the company, and this should drive shares higher if there is no collapse in the net interest margin,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.Wells Fargo rose 0.8% to 55.60. Shares climbed 0.2% to 55.17 on Wednesday.

190,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that much of the bank's post-Brexit fate in the U.K. was up to the European Union, and he noted the risk that could come from central banks' moves to put the brakes on quantitative easing.The remarks, made at a conference in Paris, came ahead of the bank's second-quarter earnings, set to be reported on Friday. Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also report then.""We've never had QE like this before,"" Dimon said in video available on Bloomberg, referring to the quantitative easing — or central banks' purchases of government bonds and other securities in attempt to shore up markets after the financial crisis and recession a decade ago. ""We've never had unwinding like this before. Obviously, that should say something to you about the risk that might mean.""IBD'S TAKE: Weaker trading seems likely to hurt banks when their second-quarter earnings kick off, but one analyst cites a few big longer-term catalysts investors can look forward to.""I think the reversal of the actual monetary, you know, selling securities in the marketplace, I think when that happens of size or substance, it could be a little more disruptive than people think,"" Dimon added. ""Again if the economies are growing, it's not that big a deal. But again, it's never happened before.""The Federal Reserve has signaled that it will soon start paring its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, perhaps as soon as September, by letting maturing bonds run off instead of reinvesting the funds. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is hinting that it may start reducing bond buys soon.At the conference, Dimon also said that the bank needed to ""be prepared for hard Brexit"" — or a full, clean divorce between the United Kingdom and the EU. The U.K. voted to leave the bloc last year.But he said that was easy to plan for that. ""Several hundred jobs or hundreds of jobs"" would have to be done through an EU subsidiary, he said. Locations in Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg could carry out most of the bank's operations, he said.He said there were 16,000 JPMorgan employees in the U.K., but that three quarters of them serviced EU companies. And he said what the bank's operations ultimately looked like in the wake of Brexit, after an initial round of relocations, would be up to the bloc's regulators.""What happens next is totally up to EU. It's not up to Britain."" he said. He added: ""If the EU determines over time that they want to start to move a lot more jobs out of London into the EU, they can simply dictate that.""JPMorgan, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 0.4% to 92.83 in the stock market today, still within a 5% chase zone of an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. Bank of America (BAC) slid 1.2% to 24.60, as it makes its way through a flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.1% to 45.48.

193,WFC,"TrumpCare isn't going to pass, the U.S. economy won't get a Trump-fueled bounce and the S&P 500 index will end the year at 2400, slightly lower than current levels, Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday.A day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped plans for a TrumpCare vote this week amid growing opposition, Goldman political analyst Alec Phillips concluded, ""At this point, enactment of broad health legislation like the House passed or the Senate is contemplating seems unlikely.""Although financial markets slumped on Tuesday, with a late bout of selling after the TrumpCare news, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all recorded solid gains in Wednesday trading intraday, with technology stocks bouncing after bearing the brunt of the prior day's sell-off.The good news from Goldman is that, unlike in March, when markets dove as prospects for ObamaCare repeal dimmed in the House, investor confidence in the ability of the Trump administration and the GOP Congress to push through sweeping legislation has already been wounded.Bank stocks rallied for a third straight day on Wednesday amid a rise in Treasury yields and good news on their stress tests. (Investors expect positive results and shareholder returns approved in the second round of stress test results late Wednesday.)Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.6% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 2% to 89.82, breaking out of a double-bottom base buy point of 89.23. That's a big change from how bank stocks behaved when TrumpCare suffered its first big setback in March, with Wells Fargo sliding 3% on March 21, JPMorgan Chase almost 6% and Bank of America nearly 6%.""At this stage, it seems fairly clear that intraparty disputes and a thin margin in the Senate have made sweeping reforms difficult,"" so there's unlikely to be an significant market fallout, Phillips wrote.Hospital stocks, which could suffer from the steep cuts in Medicaid and a rise in the uninsured projected under TrumpCare, were among the leaders on Wednesday. Universal Health Services (UHS) rose 2%, HCA Healthcare (HCA) 1.1% and Tenet Healthcare (THC) 3%.Insurers were broadly, though modestly, higher, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rising 0.6%. UnitedHealth, a Dow industrials component like JPMorgan, has mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges. But UnitedHealth is a big player in the Medicaid managed care market, which could be stunted by TrumpCare. On the other hand, TrumpCare would kill off a health insurance tax, a priority for UnitedHealth and other insurers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD revised the market trend to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a status that means investors should exercise extra caution in buying stocks and consider taking profits to raise cash for when the turbulence clears. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investing.The less encouraging news from Goldman is that there's not much reason for investors to be excited about prospects for the broader market or economy over the next several years. Goldman's chief equity strategist, David Kostin, raised his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 2400 from 2300, but that's about 1% below Tuesday's close. He sees dismal returns in the next two years as ""late-cycle dynamics"" yield positive but decelerating sales and earnings growth. His year-end targets for 2018 and 2019 are 2500 and 2600, respectively.Goldman now sees GDP growth of 2.1% this year, 2.2% next and 1.7% in 2019.The possible silver lining in Kostin's outlook is that he's not assuming any reduction in the corporate tax rate, so there's room for an upside surprise. In that respect, his outlook seems more or less consistent with that of David Bianco, chief investment strategist in the Americas for Deutsche Asset Management, who wrote recently that the S&P should trade at 2450 — but only ""upon clear signs of a significant and simple corporate tax cut"" to a 25% rate.The potential problem is that the legislative lift doesn't get any lighter after health care. This week, the House set aside plans to release a fiscal 2018 budget resolution as conservatives and moderates butted heads over whether to require $200 billion in entitlement savings. Doing so, moderates warned, could make tax cuts much harder to pass.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketJPMorgan, Bank Of America Lead Bank Rally Amid Strong Payout HopesTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts

"
195,WFC,"Earnings for the second quarter kick off in earnest next week with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on the docket. Early indications point to another strong season.XS&P 500 companies are expected to report 8% earnings growth on a 4.6% gain in revenues, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S as of July 6. That's a big reversal from a 2.1% profit decline in Q2 2016 as the energy-led earnings slump extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. And it solidifies the comeback that has seen S&P 500 profit growth of 4.3%, 8% and 15.3% in the last three quarters.Apple (AAPL), which has returned to growth in the prior two quarters, should continue to show EPS and revenue gains when it reports on Aug. 1. That's despite many consumers awaiting the Apple iPhone 8 later this year. Due to its massive size, Apple has an outsized impact on overall S&P 500 earnings and especially the S&P 500 technology sector. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) should see fat profit gains.That 8% overall earnings target for the second quarter is down 2 percentage points from the start of April, but that's half the usual four-point cut typically seen.That is fueling optimism on Wall Street that Q1's momentum — which saw earnings growth hit its highest level since 2011 — will continue into future quarters.""There is a lot more confidence in what is expected for Q3 than at this time last year,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.One downside to the modest revisions: The markets may already be pricing in strong results. Investors have been taking profits in leading tech stocks over the past month.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the opportunity for big gains or big losses. You may want to adopt this earnings options strategy to capture any upside while limiting your losses.Beyond Q2, S&P 500 companies should grow earnings 8.6% and 13.1% in Q3 and Q4, according to Thomson Reuters. They are estimated to grow earnings 11.3% in 2017 as a whole and 11.7% in 2018 vs. 1.4% in 2016.Profits and revenues have been robust from the roughly 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results so far, including Nike (NKE), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). Of those 23 companies, 78% have beaten EPS estimates and 87% have topped revenue forecasts.In a typical quarter, 64% of companies overall beat earnings estimates and 59% beat revenue views.The energy, technology and financials sectors are expected to drive earnings growth in Q2 — a period over which the S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and set a new all-time closing of 2,453 on June 19.Oil and gas companies earnings should reverse higher after an outright loss a year earlier. But oil prices are down significantly from the start of 2017, which has hurt shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks.Financials and technology, the two largest S&P 500 sectors, are expected to moderate earnings growth from the near-20% Q1 pace. But growth should still be solid, with financials up 7.6% and technology 11.2%, according to Thomson Reuters.Banks continue to see a deceleration in loan growth and unfavorable moves in bond yields, Mian said.Several Wall Street giants have warned of weak trading revenue in Q2, continuing the lackluster trend in 2017. That's a key reason why JPMorgan and Citigroup are expected to show little-to-no profit growth, while regional banks such Comerica (CMA) should see big EPS gains.Still, bank stocks large and small have been leading in recent weeks, helped by higher bond yields and massive buyback and dividend plans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have moved past buy points to long-time highs, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and others are in buy zones.Technology is the only sector outside of energy that is expected to best the overall 8% S&P 500 gain. The sector also has gotten a boost from Adobe, Oracle and Micron Technology (MU), which smashed quarterly expectations in late June, Mian said. Expect strong growth for Alphabet and Facebook, he added.Health care, which has seen shares of health insurers and many biotechs soar in 2017, is estimated to grow earnings a tepid 2.3%. Other laggards are likely to include materials (4.3%), consumer staples (3.6%), industrials (2.4%), real estate (1.9%), telecom (1.1%) and consumer discretionary (0.9%).The utilities sector should post a 2.8% earnings decline. Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, only industrials has seen an upward estimate revision for Q2 since the start of April.Zacks, which tracks sectors differently, expects aerospace, construction and industrial products to shine, with earnings growth of 49%, 15.6% and 11.9% respectively.Multinationals such as Apple, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Facebook, are expected to see less drag from a strong dollar on their earnings.""The dollar was only 4% higher year over year in the second quarter on average, so we don't expect a major impact to earnings because of that,"" said Lindsey Bell, a CFRA investment strategist. The greenback's continued weakness since then should provide a tailwind to multinationals' Q3 earnings.Mian also expects multinationals to benefit from a notably improved overseas growth outlook.""A dividing line in the last earnings season was that more internationally oriented companies had a more positive view of business than those that are domestically oriented,"" he said. ""I expect that trend to continue.""Q2 earnings growth should top current analyst estimates, in keeping with historical trends. But matching Q1's blowout performance will be a tough order, Mian said.The first quarter saw double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle — and that is unlikely to be surpassed for the next few quarters, in Mian's view.RELATED:Q2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

"
199,WFC,"Results from the Federal Reserve's stress tests this week and next could give bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) a much-needed push higher, analysts say, with bank management showing signs they could be more generous with the returns to investors that typically follow the central bank's annual grading of the industry's financial health.The industry's more aggressive position would come as the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress look to slash regulations created after the financial crisis. It would also come as the biggest banks sit on piles of excess capital, and after a new rule was adopted this year that exempts many smaller, less complex banks from a key portion of the test.But even as banks become accustomed to their summer-season report card, an across-the-board pass isn't guaranteed for the biggest banks. While the 34 banks being tested this year are expected to pass, the tests could present the latest hurdle for Wells Fargo (WFC), whose culture and quality control been called into question following a massive sham-account scandal last year.Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck, in a research note this month, estimated that Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup (C) alone have a combined $79 billion in extra capital. And she said the gross payout of dividends and buybacks from most of the banks being tested could rise to 95% of yearly earnings, up from 84% last year.In light of that potential payout boost, she said that investors might consider buying.""Bank stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 by 11% (year to date). We think this is the time to build positions in banks ahead of CCAR,"" Graseck said in a separate note, referring to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.Graseck, as well as analysts at Instinet and KBW, expect good things from Citi after the tests. Citi has more excess capital than rivals, Morgan Stanley estimates, and the bank could gain more than rivals from simpler regulations. Instinet estimates the bank could pay out more than 100% of earnings.Citigroup CFO John Gerspach indicated enthusiasm about the tests as well. He closed out an investor conference last week by saying: ""Can't wait for CCAR.""IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have recently recaptured their 50-day moving averages. Goldman Sachs also has retaken that benchmark and just earned an upgrade to its Relative Strength Rating.The Fed each year hits the banks with two tests. Results from the first, the Dodd-Frank Act stress test, come out on Thursday. That test runs the banks through different economic scenarios — from OK to bad to really bad — and shows how their capital cushions hold up.Results of the second test, the CCAR, will be released on June 28. The CCAR also evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures, and determines whether banks can move forward with their dividend and buyback plans.However, less complex banks with between $50 billion to $250 billion in consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in nonbank assets were exempted from that qualitative portion of this year's tests.Twenty-one banks this year are exempt from that portion. The biggest global banks that operate out of the U.S. still need to pass that part.The Fed in February released its outline of the different economic scenarios that banks must withstand for the tests. Banks had to submit their responses to the Fed by April 5.In the Fed's ""severely adverse scenario"" — the one that is most closely watched — banks must weather 10% unemployment in the U.S., a 25% drop in home prices in 2019 and basement-level Treasury rates, among other conditions. They must show they have a capital cushion and risk mechanisms to absorb a global recession that engulfs the eurozone and the U.K., as well as slowing growth in Asia.The downturn in this year's stress-test parameters is more pronounced in the U.S., the U.K. and the eurozone than last year. But this year's stress tests don't include the prospect of negative short-term Treasury rates.While President Trump's election initially propelled bank stocks higher, the gains have flattened as yields weaken and investors await some of the broad regulatory and tax overhauls he promised during his presidential bid.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has been struggling with a scandal in which fake consumer accounts were created by sales staff under intense pressure to meet sales goals. The scandal, analysts say, could threaten the bank's ability to pass the qualitative portion of the CCAR test.""Given ongoing concerns about the momentum within Wells' businesses, lagging capital returns will be viewed negatively, and it would be another sign that Wells is underperforming vs. peers,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts said in a research note last month.RELATED:Here's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

201,WFC,"A canny move by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to invest in troubled banks after the 2008 financial crisis has paid off again. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) chairman will pocket $12 billion from an investment in Bank of America (BAC) six years ago, with this week's bank stress-test results set to deliver a giant windfall to his stock portfolio.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced Friday that it will exercise warrants in the bank allowing it to acquire 700 million common shares at $7.14 each. That transaction works out to about $5 billion, but is actually worth roughly $17.02 billion based on Bank of America's Friday intraday price of 24.37 — making for a profit of approximately $12 billion.The move came after Bank of America's decision Wednesday to raise its annual dividend by 60% to 12 cents a quarter. Earlier that same day, the Federal Reserve said that Bank of America and the other firms subject to the central bank's annual stress tests cleared the final round of those tests, paving the way for the dividend increase.Berkshire's move, which would make the company BofA's biggest shareholder, also delivers on expectations that Buffett raised in his annual letter to shareholders.""If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock — now 30 cents annually — should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common,"" Buffett said in the letter. 2021 is the deadline to execute the warrants.Buffett in March 2013 made roughly $3.1 billion off an investment in Goldman Sachs (GS) at the height of the financial crisis. His deal with the investment bank included both preferred shares and warrants, which are similar to options in that they give an investor the legal right to buy a stock at a specific price.Preferred shares, like common shares, represent an ownership stake in a company. However, preferred shares are seen as ""safer"" because shareholders get priority when it comes to dividends and bankruptcy, as their name would suggest. That usually comes at the cost of not having the same voting rights as common shareholders.Buffett's decision to exercise the warrants Friday was seen as a vote of confidence in Bank of America. Shares of Bank of America were roughly flat at 24.33 in late-morning trade on the stock market today. Bank of America's gains so far this week put shares closer to a 25.90 buy point from a first-stage flat base.Other money-center banks were mixed Friday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a Dow industrials component, added 0.3%, Wells Fargo (WFC) gave up 0.7% as it moves through a cup base, and Citigroup (C) was down 0.15%.Goldman Sachs, another Dow financial, shed 1.1%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 0.4%.The blue-chip Dow itself traded up 0.3% as Nike (NKE) outperformed on news of its Amazon (AMZN) deal.RELATED:Nike Spikes Into Buy Zone After Scoring With Earnings, AmazonJPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Wells Fargo Hike Payouts, OK Massive Buybacks

202,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

207,WFC,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Thursday rose to 54.9 in May from 54.8 in April, just beating expectations for a slight dip, as the factory sector continues to show healthy growth.Wall Street economists expected the ISM gauge to dip to 54.7. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.The 10-year Treasury yield, which had fallen near a postelection low in recent days amid, perked up to 2.23% before the report after payroll processor ADP's monthly employment report showed a surprisingly strong 253,000 gain in private payrolls in May.

209,WFC,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were higher early Wednesday, signaling little change at the opening bell.The major averages edged lower in Tuesday's stock market trading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite snapping seven-day winning streaks. Several big-cap tech giants hit fresh all-time highs, but bank stocks were among the notable losers, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC). Citigroup (C) also edged lower, but remains in relatively sound shape.XDow industrials futures rose a fraction above fair value, S&P 500 futures also edged up while Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1%. U.S. crude oil futures fell nearly 2% to below $49 a barrel amid renewed oversupply concerns.Bank stocks were big leaders of the so-called Trump rally following the presidential election. But the stocks have struggled for several months. Here are four reasons to look beyond the banks to other sectors.Dow industrials component JPMorgan Chase narrowly avoided undercutting the low of its base Tuesday, setting a four-month closing low. JPMorgan Chase, fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are all below their downwardly sloping 50-day moving averages, with Wells Fargo (WFC) under its 200-day for good measure.Relative strength lines, which track how stocks perform vs. the S&P 500, highlight how financials have lagged in 2017. JPMorgan's RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since Election Day, with other banks' RS lines showing similar weakness.Citigroup is an exception. Citi is just below a 62.63 buy point in a flat base, and is still in range from an aggressive entry at 60.89. Citi's RS line isn't great but has risen fractionally over the past four months.IBD'S TAKE: Every day the market is full of noise. So what should you focus on? IBD's Investing Action Plan highlights top earnings reports, stock near entries and key economic data for the coming day. In the latest action plan, we highlight three stocks in buy range with earnings due Wednesday.A big reason why bank stocks, and the overall market, rallied on Trump's election was the prospect of tax cuts and other pro-growth measures. But Trump has been embroiled in troubles, distracting the White House and sapping his political capital. Republicans are divided on key issues, including how much to cut and how to offset the lost revenue, if at all. Wall Street appears to be pricing-out prospects for major tax reform, at least in 2017.Bank executives, and perhaps investors, are still hopeful that the Trump administration will ease financial regulatory burdens that limit lending and buybacks.Stronger economic growth should spur demand for loans, but it also should encourage higher interest rates and wider spreads between banks' short-term funding costs and long-term lending rates. Yield spreads widened after the election. But with the Federal Reserve raising short-term official rates and the 10-year Treasury yield sliding toward 2017 lows, the yield curve is the flattest in seven months. That's bad news for banks' net interest margins and not a great sign for the economy either.Bank stocks are going through a lull right now. Perhaps they'll turn around soon. But looking at long-term charts, bank stocks haven't really outperformed the S&P 500 for long stretches, even well-run operations such as JPMorgan. Bank stocks have had short-term outperformance, such as in last few months of 2016, but banks are not secular market leaders.If investors want to follow the market, buying a broad index mutual fund or ETF (with banks a significant part of the holdings) can do that without the sector risk.Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1%. China's Shanghai composite, which had been closed on Tuesday, rose 0.2% after climbing much more earlier on a report indicating steady manufacturing growth.In Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.3% intraday, Germany's Dax 0.2% and France's CAC-40 edged higher.RELATED:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisThe Big Picture: Large Cap Techs Vs.

212,WFC,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index eased to 51.3 in May from 51.7 in April. After surging to a 12-year high of 56.4 in February, optimism is now a touch below where it was in early November, before the surprise election of Donald Trump.The index held above the neutral 50 level, signaling optimism for the eight straight month. But the six-month economic outlook, one of the IBD/TIPP Poll's three major subindexes, slipped just into pessimistic territory for the first time since September.The polling, from April 28 to May 4, came just after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a paltry 0.7% annual rate in the first quarter, the slowest in three years, amid weak auto sales from General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and others. Meanwhile, polling coincided with near-record highs for the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 index, and all-time highs for the Nasdaq composite.The pullback in optimism has come as a messy fight over ObamaCare has taken center stage in Washington, clouding the outlook for President Trump's proposed fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Although ObamaCare repeal cleared the House on Friday after being declared dead six weeks earlier, legislative prospects remain highly uncertain. That's because GOP moderates in the Senate have all but ruled out approving the sharp Medicaid cuts backed by the House.The risk is that a pullback in economic optimism will carry over to the business sector, after signs of exuberance were apparent in survey data. On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business said its small-business survey showed that a net 38% of firms polled in April expect the economy to improve, but that was down 8 percentage points from March. Firms reporting capital outlays slipped 5 percentage points to 59%. NFIB's overall index dipped 0.2 point to 104.5, the third straight decline from January's longtime high of 105.9.Yet second-quarter growth will likely be well above the roughly 2% trend, with current estimates from the Atlanta Federal Reserve currently pointing to the possibility of 4% growth. Treasury daily tax collections are signaling that wage gains are increasing, which could aid confidence if the trend continues. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 2.38%, the highest since April 10, as geopolitical fears ebbed after France elected pro-European Union candidate Emmanuel Macron as president in a landslide.Bank stocks, which stand to benefit from faster growth, higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve, have bounced back after sinking below their 50-day moving averages, a technical signpost that points to possible future weakness. Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and KeyCorp (KEY) have retaken their 50-day averages, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have climbed close to theirs.IBD'S TAKE: After a run of softer economic data, financial markets may now be underestimating the strength of the job market and the timing of Federal Reserve rate hikes.In May, the gauge of the six-month economic outlook fell to 49.6, down from 51.1 in April and a four-year high of 56.3 in December, as optimism soared after the election.The personal financial outlook index fell 4.2 points in May to 57.1, the lowest since November 2015.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies regained 4.5 points to 47.1, bouncing back after April's 7-point slide triggered by the ObamaCare debate. The index had signaled optimism for the first time in a decade in February.While the headline reading of the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index no longer shows a clear Trump effect since the election, the change in the White House is still obvious below the surface. Among Democrats, optimism edged up to 36.9, recovering a bit from April's nearly nine-year low of 35.8, but still down from 61.6 just before the election. Among Republicans, optimism has pulled back to 71.9 from 80.4 in February, but remains far above its pre-Trump level of 44.3.The optimism reading among independents has fallen to 49.3 vs. a January peak of 56.7, but remains above the 47.5 just before Election Day.Poll respondents with income below $50,000 a year are more pessimistic about the economy than before the election, while those above $50,000 are more optimistic. In November, men and women were equally optimistic (51.4). Now optimism among men is nearly 10 points higher than among women (55.9 vs. 46.7).RELATED:Trump's Approval Climbs As His Tax Cut Plan Wins Strong Support — IBD/TIPP Poll Trump Will Bust Up Bank Regulation, Not The Banks Tax Revenues Are Surging, So Brace For A Fed Surprise Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: Goldman
"
213,WFC,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

214,WFC,"Bank stocks, among the biggest winners since Donald Trump's election, were among the biggest losers as the president's political woes intensified. Citigroup (C) fell back below a buy point, while Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and several other big financials undercut key support levels. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both members of the Dow Jones industrial average, tumbled below the low of their current consolidations.Stocks sold off Wednesday on news reports that Trump pressured then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of Mike Flynn, who was briefly the president's national security advisor. Trump abruptly fired Comey last week.While social media is rampant with chatter of impeachment, markets are worried about more realistic scenarios. Trump's agenda for tax cuts and other pro-growth ideas already seem stalled. As a result, the odds of Federal Reserve rate hikes are falling. Treasury yields are sinking, with the yield curve flattening out once again. Bank executives and shareholders have been counting on stronger economic growth to boost lending — and widen the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates.The Trump administration could still go forward with regulatory relief for banks. But even that could be delayed or scaled back as the president and top officials are occupied putting out political fires of his own making.Citigroup last week cleared an aggressive buy point at 60.89. On Tuesday, shares ran up to just below a convention buy point of 62.63. But Citigroup tumbled 4% to 59.98 on the stock market today, back below the alternative entry though finding some support at its 50-day moving average.Bank of America, which had just gotten above its 50-day line, fell 5.9%. Morgan Stanley, off 5.6%, also broke through that support level and is on track for a 2017 closing low. Citizens Financial Group (CFG) (-6.8%), KeyCorp (KEY) (-4.8%) and Comerica (CMA) (-5.6%) were among several other financials piercing through their 50-day lines.The Dow's JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, already on the wrong side of the 50-day line, fell 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Both fell intraday below the low end of their base patterns.Wells Fargo (WFC), which can't shake the fake accounts scandal, lost 1.9%, closing just below its 200-day line.RELATED:Trump Will Bust Up Bank Regulation, Not The BanksThese Words Could Doom Trump's Tax Cuts

215,WFC,"Average pay in the financial advisor industry overall is OK, but hardly mind-blowing. As IBD has reported, the average annual salary of personal financial advisors hit $118,050 in 2015, according to careertrends.com. That topped 90% of all occupations' salaries.But look what happens to financial advisors' compensation figures when you check out paychecks beyond America's multitude of small mom-and-pop financial advisors and beyond young newcomers to the field, whether they toil on Wall Street or Main Street. Top yearly base compensation at regional broker-dealers and wirehouses ranges from $140,000 for financial advisors at UBS whose 2017 production will be $400,000, to $1,105,000 for Raymond James & Associates financial advisors whose production this year hits $2 million, according to a new survey by the publication On Wall Street.On Wall Street's data include pay for financial advisors with 10 years of service. The firm combines cash pay and deferred compensation, and it excludes any bonus financial advisors may earn or performance penalty they may incur. It also excludes any company match to 401(k) or other profit-sharing plans.Further, it assumes that a financial advisor's production — products and services sold to clients — is in the form of individual stocks, bonds, mutual funds and fee-based services such as wrap accounts and managed accounts, with each of those accounting for 25% of the advisor's business. What happens if one of those is less than 25%? It's not counted?The On Wall Street results show compensation ranging from 35% of production for a $400,000 producer at UBS to 55% of production for a $2 million producer at Raymond James.In between, On Wall Street's survey details compensation for $600,000 producers and $1 million producers.""I think some firms would pay a higher percentage if you were, say, a $5 million producer,"" On Wall Street senior editor Andrew Welsch told IBD.In the survey, the cash portion — called cash grid — ranges from a low of 66.6% of total compensation for Edward Jones to 100% of total compensation for several firms at several levels of production. In most cases, cash accounted for about 83% to 98% of total compensation.The data divides pay into cash and deferred portions. ""Cash is what you get paid upfront,"" Welsch said. ""Some more cynical people might call the deferred compensation golden handcuffs because you must stay at the firm to get that at some time in the future.""Welsch added: ""Some wirehouses increase the deferred part of the equation. They say it helps them balance their (profit-and-loss statement) and offset costs. Their argument is that it allows them to pay advisors more in theory, because more of the pay is deferred. A cynical advisor would say they are just taking that from the cash component. You've got to wait for the deferred part to vest.""The compensation data shows a trend over the years regarding break points where advisors' compensation rises based on production. ""Pay is staying roughly the same, but the thresholds (for break points) keep moving back,"" he said. ""The firms are moving the goal posts. If you want to earn the same amount as in previous years, you have to produce more. You must do more business to earn the same take-home pay.""For financial firms, moving those break points back can become a game of chicken with financial advisors. ""Changes in the break points are one of the key reasons why advisors leave wirehouses and go to independent RIAs,"" Welsch said. ""They know exactly what they'll make there (at the RIA). At the wirehouses, there's always uncertainty about what the next year's (break points) will be.""Financial firms must carefully weigh how quickly to move those break points back. ""The changes are always small,"" Welsch said. ""They don't want to trigger a mass exodus of advisors.""Survey respondents included wirehouses — or full-service financial firms — Wells Fargo (WFC), UBS (UBS), Bank of America's[ticker symb=BAC] Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley (MS).Other regionals were RBC Wealth Management, Hilliard Lyons, Stifel, Janney Montgomery Scott, Wunderlich and Edward Jones.RELATED:How Much Is A Financial Advisor's Service Really Worth?How A Top Financial Advisor Turned A Lemon Investment Into A Sweet Career

Citi rose 0.6% to 61.07 in Friday stock market trading. The current consolidation has a standard buy point of 62.63, 10 cents above the March 8 intraday peak. However, investors could view 60.89 as an aggressive entry. Citi nudged past that price several times in the past two weeks, but didn't close above it until Friday. Volume was 9% below average on Friday, which suggests lackluster buying by big institutions.IBD'S TAKE: From JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the small, community banks, the financial industry believes post-crisis regulation and capital requirements go too far. President Trump signaled he's open to breaking up banking giants, but here's an in-depth look at why Trump will bust up bank regulation, not the banks.Citi's relative strength line has moved sideways for the past few months, below early January peaks.

217,WFC,"One of the biggest winners from the RyanCare debacle may be Wal-Mart (WMT).House Speaker Paul Ryan's other baby, of course, is the 20% border-adjusted tax on imports. Big importers like Wal-Mart and Nike (NKE), both members of the Dow Jones industrial average, along with Best Buy (BBY) and many other retailers have fought hard to defeat it. General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM) also oppose the tax that auto analysts have said could raise average car prices by $2,000.Even as President Trump is saying that he has no interest in pushing for Ryan's ouster as speaker, White House aides are making it clear that Trump believes Ryan deserves full blame for failure to repeal ObamaCare.Special Report: IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsThe key point is that this marriage of convenience between Trump and Ryan is over. It now seems impossible to imagine Trump hitching tax cuts to Ryan's very unpopular vehicle for getting them passed.While a stronger dollar could largely counteract or negate the impact of a border tax on imported goods, a number of GOP senators have voiced opposition to Ryan's border tax, and its prospects for ultimate passage look no greater than RyanCare's.Wall Street fretted about a defeat for RyanCare for much of last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all suffering their sharpest one-day losses since fall on Tuesday as the conservative House Freedom Caucus began to close ranks against Ryan's American Health Care Act. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and many other financials have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare.Yet after striking out with his first big legislative push, Trump is only too eager to shift to tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The real impact of failure on ObamaCare repeal will be to increase the urgency of tax cuts to save the GOP from a 2018 election debacle. Acting quickly could allow the GOP to make some tax cuts retroactive to 2017, meaning the payoff for voters would come before Election Day in 2018.So how would the GOP replace the $1 trillion raised by the border tax to pay for a cut in corporate tax rates? They likely wouldn't, opting instead to go with tax cuts instead of tax reform. With their backs to the wall, there's a strong chance that Republicans would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut.If Trump is able to keep his pledge to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% or less, without depending on a border tax, that could be great news for Wal-Mart and other retailers, which pay above-average tax rates because they don't tend to benefit much from tax credits for domestic manufacturing and R&D. In November, Wal-Mart forecast a companywide 31% to 32% effective tax rate for its current fiscal year, including its international locations. The bottom line is that instead of being one of the potential losers in tax reform, Wal-Mart could become among the big winners. (Wall Street is unsure. Wal-Mart shares fell a fraction for the week, trading just below their 200-day moving average.)While Senate budget reconciliation requiring just a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than deficit neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience, and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare. It's also unclear how the Federal Reserve and financial markets would respond to a big fiscal stimulus and higher deficits. Higher borrowing costs and uncertainty over the future of tax rates also might reduce the effectiveness of tax cuts to a significant extent.RELATED:The Bull Case For Tax Cuts If ObamaCare Repeal FailsTrump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformIf Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

220,WFC,"Bank stocks such as Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) reversed Wednesday after the Federal Reserve hiked the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point but didn't give any signs that it would step up the pace of future hikes.The Fed indicated that there would be two more rate hikes this year, in line with earlier expectations. Markets had generally priced in a total of three hikes for 2017, but there had been some speculation that policymakers could shift to a four-hike path. Policymakers also see three increases next year.Higher rates help widen banks' net interest margins, allowing lenders to charge borrowers more interest and boosting bottom lines.The 10-year Treasury yield — which influences rates on different types of debt and is seen as a window into investor expectations of inflation — tumbled 9 basis points to 2.50% after running up in recent weeks ahead of the Fed meeting. The two-year yield fell 7 basis points to 1.31%.Shares of JPMorgan reversed from solid gains and briefly turned negative as yields fell and the curve flattened. JPMorgan closed up 0.2% on the stock market today.Most other bank stocks were in the red. Goldman Sachs dipped 0.4%. Bank of America (BAC), whose large U.S. operations make it more sensitive to rate fluctuations than other banks, turned negative, fell 0.6%.Citigroup (C) retreated 1%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 0.7% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are among the few to benefit when the Fed raises rates, since the extra costs ripple through to consumers. When consumers pay more on loans, that can help banks' net interest margins. The forecast follows a steep climb for banking stocks following President Trump's election, on the hopes for deregulation, inflation, and for the economic growth that could prompt the Fed to raise rates — one of the things the central bank does to keep the economy from overheating.RELATED:February Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, FedYellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017
"
221,WFC,"Fed chief Janet Yellen sealed the deal for an interest-rate hike on March 15, saying it ""would likely be appropriate,"" as long as the economy doesn't flash unexpected weakness.Yellen also endorsed three rate hikes in 2017 as appropriate, though decisions will remain data-dependent.Dow financials JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) closed modestly higher after Yellen's remarks, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq closed slightly higher.Yellen's speech followed a wave of hawkish Fed comments and strong economic data, which continued on Friday.Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""Earlier Friday, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said that the central bank must act pre-emptively in raising interest rates or it risks a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s. Even from a reliable hawk, the warning was surprising.Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management gauge of nonmanufacturing activity surged to 57.6 in February, the highest level since October 2015.That news made a Fed rate hike on March 15 seem like even more of a slam dunk. Markets now see an 86% chance of an increase, a dramatic turnaround since the beginning of the week, when a hike was seen as a distant possibility. Markets now see a 55% chance of at least three hikes by the December meeting.Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, one of the more dovish officials on the central bank, said he still favors gradual tightening.Yellen put the idea of a March hike on the table last month when she warned of the risks of waiting too long. Yellen could lock in market expectations for March rate hike or reintroduce investor doubts.Although the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were almost unchanged Friday intraday, bank stocks continued to rise on hopes for stronger growth and higher rates. JPMorgan Chase rose 0.7% to 92.80, while Goldman Sachs advanced 0.7% to 252.89. Wells Fargo (WFC) crept up 0.3% to 58.89 and Bank of America (BAC) added 0.8% to 25.44. All four banks hit all-time or post-crisis highs this week.Banks benefit from a wider yield spread, letting them borrow short and lend long. The 10-year Treasury yield has soared in the last few days, but the curve has continued to flatten as the two-year yield spikes to its highest level since 2008.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.On Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley, generally seen as a dovish policymaker, said the case for a March hike had ""gotten a lot more compelling.""On Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing activity gauge hit a 30-month high of 57.7 as new orders surged. The data seemed to support Dudley's contention that the ""animal spirits"" of business decision makers were emboldened by the election of President Trump.Weekly initial jobless claims tumbled to their lowest level in nearly 44 years, the Labor Department said Thursday.RELATED:ISM Manufacturing Index Surges To 30-Month High, Fueling Fed HawksFed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'Compelling'

222,WFC,"The U.S. cost of living increased in January by the most in four years, led by higher costs for gasoline and other goods and services that indicate inflation is gathering momentum, Labor Department figures showed Wednesday.The consumer-price index rose a larger-than-forecast 0.6% after a 0.3% gain in December, the biggest move upward since February 2013. Compared with the same month last year, costs paid by Americans for goods and services rose 2.5%, the biggest year-over-year gain since March 2012.Higher prices for gasoline, apparel and new cars show cost pressures are building as steady demand provides some companies with pricing power.The figures underscore Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's congressional testimony on Tuesday that more interest-rate increases will be appropriate if inflation picks up and the labor market remains tight.""CPI inflation has been steady in recent months amid rising energy prices,"" Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities (WFC) in Charlotte, N.C., said in a note before the report. ""After the past couple years, the transitory nature of the dip in inflation due to the decline in energy prices has come to fruition.""A 7.8% jump in the cost of gasoline accounted for about half the increase in the January CPI. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3% month-over-month advance in the CPI.But costs of some other goods and services also moved up. Clothing prices jumped 1.4%, the most since February 2009. Men's apparel surged by the most on record. New vehicle prices climbed 0.9% in January, the biggest advance since November 2009.The core CPI measure, which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, rose 0.3%, the most in five months. Core inflation increased 2.3% from January 2016.The Bloomberg survey median called for the core index to rise 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.1% from the prior year.""At our upcoming meetings, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate,"" Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks Tuesday.The Fed Chair reiterated that falling behind on inflation could do more harm to the economy and possibly cut short the expansion. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, has been below the central bank's 2% target since April 2012. It finished with a gain of 1.6% last year.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession,"" she added.Wednesday's report from the Labor Department showed energy costs increased 4% from a month earlier. Food prices rose 0.1%.The CPI is the broadest of three price gauges from the Labor Department because it includes all goods and services. About 60% of the index covers prices consumers pay for services from medical visits to airline fares, movie tickets and rents.The higher cost of living put a dent in Americans' paychecks in January, a separate report from the Labor Department showed Wednesday. Hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.5% from the prior month and were unchanged over the past 12 months.

223,WFC,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Monday fell to 54.8 in April, a further deceleration after the gauge of factory activity hit a two-and-a-half year peak of 57.7 in February.Wall Street economists expected the ISM gauge to dip to 56.0 from 56.5 in March. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened higher on the stock market today, but the Dow weakened before the ISM report, and all of the major averages lost ground after the softer-than-expected data. Treasury yields were little changed.The new orders index slid to 57.5 from 64.5, while the current production gauge rose to 58.6 from 57.6. The employment gauge dropped to 52.0 from March's six-year high of 58.9. The gauge of order backlogs was roughly stable at 57.0.The still-solid readings on manufacturing activity come despite some question marks for the auto sector. General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and other automakers are due to report April auto sales on Tuesday. Ward's Auto expects that sales rebounded to a 17.2 million annual pace from March's weaker-than-expected 16.5 million level. GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) may be in a better position than foreign automakers, given the Big 3's emphasis on popular SUVs and pickup trucks.GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler reported earnings last week.The ISM report starts off a batch of key economic reports this week, including Friday's jobs report. The Federal Reserve isn't expected to hike rates when it meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but the data will influence whether policymakers raise rates in June.IBD'S TAKE: Apple, Facebook and Tesla earnings lead this week's Investing Action Plan. Make sure you get the plan for each trading day, including which top stocks are in a buy zone.Markets are pricing in just one more hike this year, but the Fed has signaled that it will raise rates twice and begin to scale back its asset holdings, an effective tightening, by the end of 2017 if the economy performs as expected.The 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back amid international friction and doubts about President Trump's ability to get major tax and infrastructure spending through Congress on a timely basis. That's been a negative for banks, which can reap bigger profits from faster growth, higher rates and a steeper yield curve. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) all remained stuck below their 50-day moving averages last week.

224,WFC,"Drugmakers and financial services firms look like attractive investments after years of being beaten down, said Charles Pohl, a manager of the Dodge & Cox Balanced Fund (DODBX), during a panel session Thursday at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago.Financial services are the $15.8 billion mutual fund's largest sector, with 29% of shareholder money as of March 31.That mutual fund is exposed to foreign financials, including ADRs of Netherlands-based Aegon (AEG), which provides insurance, pension and asset management. It also hold bonds from the U.K.'s Barclays (BCS), which provides banking and other financial services, as well as France's BNP Paribas.Still, the fund's financial services exposure is mainly U.S. based, though those holdings do business globally. The fund's top four holdings are U.S. stocks Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Capital One Financial (COF).In the panel discussion occurring on the conference's first full day, Pohl said rising rates in the U.S. are a tailwind. So are gradually easing regulatory burdens abroad.Noriko Chen, a manager of $63.3 billion American Funds New Perspective (ANWPX), agreed, pointing out that political pressures beating down on financials globally have created buying opportunities.Swiss-based insurer Chubb (CB) is a top-25 holding. So is Hong Kong-based AIA Group, which provides life insurance and other financial services.An aging population is a key factor in making pharmaceutical companies attractive.Among pharmaceuticals, ADRs of France's Sanofi (SNY) and Switzerland's Novartis (NVS) are in the top 10 of Pohl's fund. Britain and Sweden's AstraZeneca (AZN) is also a holding.Chen said she also likes certain state-owned enterprises (SOEs) whose home-country governments mandate that the firms pay relatively hefty dividends. Some of those dividend yields in China and Brazil are 25% or higher, she said.Forty-two percent of her fund's assets are foreign stocks. Fourteen percent are domiciled in the Asia/Pacific region.Panelist Amit Wadhwaney of Moerus Capital Management, another value-oriented investor, said he likes British-based Coats Group, the world's largest manufacturer of thread. He likes its pricing power and elastic demand. Shares have climbed 113% the past 12 months vs. 14% for the S&P 500.His firm's taste for stocks with strength and staying power is reflected in its name, the first word of which is a Latin reference to a city's defensive walls.

Ed Perks, a manager of $82.9 billion Franklin Income Fund (FKINX), said retirees should be able to withdraw 3% to 3.5% a year from their retirement nest egg. His fund's trailing 12-month yield is 5.08%, according to Morningstar Inc.Its top-five holding as of March 31 were Royal Dutch Shell ADS (RSDA), Dow Chemical (DOW), BASF (BASY), Wells Fargo (WFC) and General Electric (GE).Shell's stock price has fallen 5.5% in the past 12 months, raising its dividend yield to 7.18%. Dow's stock has risen 23% where it yields 2.86%. Chemical company BASF's stock has surged 24% where it yields 3.18%. Wells Fargo's stock has climbed 10%, putting its yield at 2.79%. GE's stock has slipped 2% and yields 3.21%.Brett Sumsion, a manager of several Fidelity Investments target date funds, said that ETFs let fund managers and individual investors bet on groups of dividend-paying stocks rather than trying to hunt for individually strong dividend equities.For a fund manager, a similar strategy is to invest in other mutual funds. That's what Sumsion's $2.1 billion Freedom Income (FFFAX) does. It yields yield is 1.62%. It holds Fidelity Series funds, which are only available to Fidelity funds of funds. The $24.2 billion Fidelity Series Investment Grade Bond (FISGX) accounts for 37% of Freedom Income's assets.Franklin's Perks touted the total return benefits of stocks that are able to pay dividends even through market downturns. He noted that such stocks greatly outperformed through and after the 2008-09 financial crisis.Investors also have the option of investing in mutual funds that aim for stocks whose dividends grow. Capital Group portfolio manager Andrew Suzman cited his fund family's $104 billion American Funds Capital Income Builder (CAIBX) as an example.The fund yields 3.39%. The fund's average annual return of 7.31% over the five years ended April 26 outperformed 89% of the fund's world-allocation peers tracked by Morningstar.RELATED:What's The Dow Industrial Average Doing Now?

228,WFC,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Wednesday rose to 57.7 in February as factory activity accelerated for the sixth straight month. That's the best reading since August 2014, giving the Federal Reserve more reasons to raise rates this month.Wall Street economists expected the ISM gauge to rise to 56.2 from 56.0 in January. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.The new orders index jumped to 65.1 from 60.4, while the current production gauge hit 62.9, up from 61.4. The only somewhat soft spot was employment, which still expanded, but at a slower rate, slipping to 54.2 from 56.1.The steady improvement in the manufacturing sector is part of the solidifying economic backdrop that could lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again on March 15. Markets were pricing in 69% odds of a March hike on early Wednesday, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. The odds doubled to 62% on Tuesday after two Fed policymakers gave a strong signal that they backed a near-term rate increased.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 also hitting record highs following President Trump's speech and speculation of a Fed rate hike.Banks, which stand to benefit from the steeper yield curve that generally comes with higher rates, were among the big winners on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow components, climbed 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. Bank of America (BAC) rose 3.1% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 2.9%. Bank of America hit its best levels since late 2008, while JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo set all-time highs.The strength comes despite concerns that the auto sector, which had provided a big boost in manufacturing output in recent years, is now seen as a potential drag, amid a potential peaking of sales and rising inventory levels.Early reports of U.S. auto sales in February, which will released throughout the day on Wednesday, were generally positive. Ford Motor[ticker symb=F] set a record for SUV deliveries, though overall sales slipped 4%, just below Edmunds estimates. General Motors (GM) reported higher U.S. sales, though they fell short of Edmunds views. Ford shares edged up 1.4% intraday while General Motors climbed 2%.In other economic news, the PCE deflator, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, showed a 1.9% yearly gain in January, the highest since 2012 and close to the central bank's 2% target. The core PCE reported 1.7% inflation. But the same report also found inflation-adjusted consumer spending falling by the most since 2009.RELATED:

229,WFC,"Bank stocks like Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) opened higher Wednesday on the strength of ADP's monthly jobs report, which blew past expectations.The economy added 298,000 private-sector jobs in February, the best gain in nearly three years far past estimates for 183,000. The torrid acceleration shown in the ADP report comes ahead of the official government job figures for February, which are set for release Friday.The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps determine rates on mortgages and is a measure of inflation expectations, had risen to 2.56%, continuing a recent revival back to near postelection highs. Higher yields and a wider yield spread should be good for banks profits.Bond yields have been rallying on growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike at the end of the March 14-15 meeting. Fed officials have signaled that a move is likely, with markets pricing in a 91% chance that it'll happen. Investors now see about a 50-50 chance of a second hike by June's Meeting.JPMorgan Chase rose as high as 92.85 soon after the opening bell, but closed down 0.2% to 91.21 in the stock market today.

Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: Many businesses don't exactly benefit when interest rates rise. Bank stocks are different in that they actually do. JPMorgan and Goldman leaped to record highs last week after two more dovish Fed officials, John Williams and William Dudley, indicated that a rate hike could be on the horizon and that economy was gaining steam.Then, last Friday, Fed chair Janet Yellen said a rate hike this month ""would likely be appropriate,"" assuming the economy didn't suddenly falter.

Several analysts began coverage of the stock with a sell rating.Snap, an internet stock, lost 32 cents a share in 2015 and then lost 44 cents in 2016. The Street expects Snap to again lose 44 cents a share in 2017 and then lose 26 cents in 2018.While Snap also has failed to post a profit in any of the past eight quarters, revenue soared 890%, 1,255%, 666% and 406% in the past four quarters.The FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — were, with one exception, making routine moves in below-average volume.

231,WFC,"Bank stocks, including Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), rallied Wednesday as the odds for a Fed rate hike this month continued to surge following bullish commentary from the central bank's policymakers.The upswing in financials helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average above 21,000, as the major averages had their best day of 2017.Shares of JPMorgan jumped 3.3% to 93.60, hitting a fresh record high in the stock market today. Bank of America (BAC), whose large U.S. operations make it more sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations, leapt 3.3% to its best since 2008.Citigroup (C) added 2.9% to 61.54, hitting an eight-year high intraday but closing below a 61.73 buy point. Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 2.5%, setting its top levels since 2008, while Wells Fargo (WFC) climbed 3.2% to a record high.Goldman, whose large trading desk could benefit from market volatility — including the kind that might come from President Trump's tweets — rallied 1.9%, also setting an all-time best.The gains come a day after San Francisco Fed President John Williams, a policy dove, said a rate hike ""is on the table for serious consideration"" at the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting beginning on March 14.New York Fed President William Dudley, seen as being more dovish on rates, also expressed optimism Tuesday about the economy, saying ""animal spirits have been unleashed a bit"" since the election.And last week, minutes from the most recent Fed policymakers' meeting said that many in the meeting felt a rate hike should come ""fairly soon."" The odds for a March increase in the federal funds rate — the benchmark interest rate charged on overnight loans — rose to 66% Wednesday, after surging past 60% on Tuesday. On Monday, the odds were 31%.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are among the only S&P 500 stocks that actually benefit from higher rates. After years of low interest rates following the financial crisis and recession, Wall Street has been throwing its money at bank shares since the election.Analysts are expecting the Trump administration to pave the way for lower regulations, tax cuts and a massive infrastructure investment. Those measures, they say, would add jobs, push up wages and inflation expectations, prompting the Fed to raise rates to temper borrowing and overheating.When the benchmark rate rises, those extra costs ripple through the financial system, allowing banks to charge customers more for loans and other products and services.RELATED:

234,WFC,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett praised ""ambitious"" immigrants' contribution to the ""miraculous"" American story, rejected claims that stock buybacks are ""un-American"" and ripped Wall Street investment fees in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders on Saturday. Meanwhile, Berkshire reported declining operating profit but big unrealized gains in last year's investments in Apple (AAPL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers paying off.The typically optimistic Buffett said that stocks are ""virtually certain"" to rise in years to come. And he hailed America, with an implicit rebuke of anti-immigrant sentiment.""One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago ' a span of time less than triple my days on earth ' Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.""As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them un-American ' characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors. That simply isn't the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I'm not aware of any enticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)He pointed out that many companies that Berkshire invests in, including Bank of America (BAC), have been buying back shares. ""We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. ... When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.""Buffett said that wealthy Americans have been suckered out of more than $100 billion over the past decade seeking ""superior investment advice.""""When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,"" he wrote. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.""But Buffett had nothing but praise for Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, who popularized ultra-low fee index funds.""If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle,"" Buffett wrote.Buffett didn't offer hints about his possible M&A plan and was mum about Kraft Heinz (KHC), which made a short-lived $143 merger bid for Unilever (UN) this month. Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital own about 50% of Kraft Heinz.Net income rose 15% to $6.29 billion, boosted by a $1.1 billion gain from investments and derivatives. But operating profit fell 6% to $2,665 per Class A share, below analyst forecasts for $2716.60.Berkshire's equity portfolio was worth $122 billion at year-end vs. $102.5 billion on Sept. 30. Big holdings such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and American Express (AXP) were big year-end winners as financials rallied.Buffett also boosted its stakes in Apple, Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines, United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV).Berkshire acquired 61.2 million shares for $6.75 billion at an average prices of 110.17. That stake has risen by $1.6 billion as of Friday's close at 136.66. Berkshire holds a 44% gain in its Southwest stake, 35% in United and 21% in Delta Air.RELATED:What Would Warren Buffett Do?

235,WFC,"XU.S. stock indexes were mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average down the most and small caps up the most.The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6%, as IBM's (IBM) 5% loss pulled down the Dow. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.3%.Volume was up, according to preliminary data. Turnover was about 10% faster on the Nasdaq and about 1% faster on the NYSE. Trade has been mostly below average in recent weeks.Blue chips were mostly down, even apart from IBM, which is now 11% off its high. The Dow industrial average component with the best gain was Intel (INTC), up moderately in soft trade. Intel is consolidating mostly under its 10-week moving average line, which is a negative. Intel is 6% off its high.The pressure the uptrend is encountering has hit some stocks hard. The selling has been especially tough for three of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) stocks. The S&P 500 has slipped 2% off its high. But some of the concentrated Berkshire holdings have lost much more: Wells Fargo (WFC) is 13% off its high. IBM is 11%  off its high. American Express (AXP) is 7% off its high.Those three stocks alone account for about 34% of Berkshire Hathaway's assets.The so-called Trump trade also has struggled. Cement stocks and money centers have pulled about 11% and 9% respectively off their highs.Yet, one money-center stock was doing well initially Wednesday. Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 4.2% in strong volume but then reversed to trim the gain to 2%. The company beat the Street's estimate on earnings. Analysts expected earnings to rise 60% to 88 cents a share vs. the year-ago quarter. But results showed an 82% earnings pop to $1 a share.Money centers that have reported have generally had good quarters. Of the 11 stocks trading above 15 and that have reported Q1 results, 10 topped the Street's consensus estimate and only one missed. But the reaction to the beats has been subdued.The market doesn't appear to be in a generous mood.The S&P 500 lost its March 14 distribution day because of time. Distribution involves a sizable loss in a major index in rising volume. The action points to institutional selling.RELATED:Chip Gear Stocks Are Soaring: Here's WhyQualcomm Gets Downgrade, Will Report After Close

236,WFC,"XGoldman Sachs (GS) fell short of Q1 forecasts Tuesday, blaming weak trading revenue on political uncertainty and low volatility, while Bank of America (BAC) reported better-than-expected earnings, led by strong trading and net interest income.Estimates: Earnings per share of $5.31, nearly double that of a year ago, when results from some banks were driven lower by the commodities crash and a slowing economy in China. Revenue is seen jumping 33% to $8.445 billion.Results: EPS of $5.15 on revenue of $8.03 billion. Revenues from bond, currency and commodities trading was little changed at $1.69 billion. Equities trading fell 6% to $1.67 billion. Investment bank revenue grew 16% to $1.7 billion. Investment management revenue rose 12% to $1.5 billion.""The operating environment was mixed, with client activity challenged in certain market-making businesses and a more attractive backdrop for underwriting in our investment banking franchise,"" said CEO Lloyd Blankfein in a statement. ""As the economy improves, we are well-positioned to not only meet our clients' diverse needs, but also to generate operating leverage for our shareholders.""Dividend: Quarterly payout was raised 15% to 75 cents a share.Stock: Goldman fell 4.7% to 215.59 on the stock market today, tumbling to its worst level since Nov. 30. Goldman Sachs was a major drag on the Dow Jones industrial average, and sent financial stocks lower.Fellow investment banker Morgan Stanley (MS), which reports Wednesday, dropped 0.7%.Estimates: A 67% jump in EPS to 35 cents, as revenue rises 10% to $21.611 billion.Results: EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $22.2 billion. Fixed-income trading swelled to $2.9 billion, above views. Net interest income grew 5% to $11.1 billion, in line with some views.Stock: Shares rose and fell, closing off 0.4% at 22.71.Bank of America, analysts have said, is more sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates than its peers, given its large amount of business it does here. The bank's fourth-quarter earnings were helped along by cost discipline and fewer losses on bad loans, a recent Edward Jones research note said.The earnings from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America follow those last week from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Investors have become more anxious that bank stocks' postelection run might not reflect the reality on the ground. Interest rates are rising, but doubts have grown over how fast the Trump administration might be able to carry out its more bank-friendly economic agenda.Shares of big banks have fallen since March as those expectations cool. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said last week that banks could stay within the range they're in now until details on tax policy become more concrete.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon urged patience.""You all should expect, as a given, that when you have a new president, and they get going, that the nine months after the 100 days is gonna be a sausage-making period,"" Dimon told analysts on the bank's first-quarter earnings call. ""There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that.""JPMorgan and Citigroup beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, while Wells Fargo's EPS was above views. Trading results were strong for JPMorgan and Citigroup, helped in part by the outlook on interest rates.But JPMorgan's consumer and industrial loan growth was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter. Management said some of the slowdown might be due to past big acquisitions and because companies have other options, such as bonds, for financing.Citigroup also tempered its expectations for loan growth. And Wells Fargo saw auto-loan originations drop due to stricter underwriting standards, while home-loan originations also fell.RELATED:JPMorgan CEO Signals Patience As Trump's Growth Agenda Stalls

237,WFC,"U.S. stock indexes made some headway in early trade, as several banks reported view-beating results.The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each added about 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was higher on the NYSE, but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the previous session's pace.Banks were in the earnings spotlight as two megacaps, two big caps and two midcaps reported quarterly results.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rolled in with an 11% pop in earnings to $1.65 a share, topping expectations for a 2.7% gain. The megacap stock rose more than 1% in volume 325% above average.Wells Fargo (WFC), the other megacap, checked in with a 1% advance in earnings to $1 a share, topping the consensus view. While that represented only a 3% rise, the Street's consensus estimate was for a 2% decline. The gain broke a streak of five consecutive quarters of earnings declines. The stock trimmed an early loss to 1%, but in heavy volume, as it found support at its 200-day line.Big-cap PNC Financial Services (PNC) pegged earnings growth of 17% to $1.96 a share, beating the Street's estimate. Analysts expected a 9% gain. The 17% earnings pop was PNC's best in 13 quarters. The stock advanced 3% in volume 485% above normal.First Republic Bank (FRC), another big cap, grew earnings 10% to $1.01 a share, matching the consensus estimate. The stock lost 2% in volume 326% above average.Washington Federal (WAFD), a midcap, reported earnings growth of 4% to 47 cents a share.  This edged above views for no change vs. the year-ago quarter. The stock rose a penny in quiet turnover.First Horizon National (FHN), also a midcap, posted a 15% earnings gain to 23 cents a share, in line with the Street's expectations. The stock gapped down almost 2% in volume 467% above average.Stocks that start the day with volume spikes in huge percentages often see those percentages slip a bit as the session wears on.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, steel, heavy construction and telecom infrastructure were among the early top gainers.

238,WFC,"U.S. and European bank stocks spiked Monday as the French presidential election eased fears, triggering broad stock market gains, higher bond yields and increased odds for a Federal Reserve rate hike.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) closed 3.5% higher on the stock market today. Citigroup (C), which has a large base of operations internationally, advanced 3%. Bank of America (BAC) popped 4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) rallied 2.9%. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all remained below their 50-day moving average.Among European banks, the gains were far more pronounced. Deutsche Bank (DB), which has been hurt by litigation and still-open wounds in Europe's own economy, surged 11%. Barclays (BCS) jumped 5.9%.France's CAC index jumped 4.1% to finish at the highest level in nine years, while the Dow industrials rose 1% and the Nasdaq composite hit an all-time high.The lift came after the first round of French elections put Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate, narrowly ahead of Marine Le Pen, who has campaigned on a hard-right, anti-EU platform with nationalistic, anti-immigrant strains similar to those that helped carry President Trump to victory in the U.S.Macron and Le Pen now advance to a May 7 runoff. Macron, who has never been elected but is pushing a pro-reform agenda, is heavily favored. However, so was Hillary Clinton in the U.S., and many did not expect the United Kingdom to vote in favor of leaving the EU last year. But Macron appears to have a lead of more than 20 points vs. Le Pen.The outcome, Wall Street seems to think, could have been worse.A runoff between Le Pen and Jean-Luc Melenchon — a far-left candidate who also wanted to shake up France's relationship with the EU and tax the wealthy at 100% — would have triggered concerns about France's future in the euro and European Union even as the U.K. begins what could be an ugly divorce from the bloc.Meanwhile, the odds for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve by the June meeting jumped to 66% on Monday, up from 53% on Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield, a longer-term measure of inflation expectations, rose 5 basis points to 2.29% Monday morning.The European Central Bank may feel more comfortable about winding down its quantitative easing program earlier if Macron wins the French presidency.Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 4.2%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.2%.

239,WFC,"XDow Jones industrial average component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) topped Q1 estimates Thursday while Wells Fargo (WFC) beat on profit but missed on revenue.The results come as Wall Street weighs the industry's sense of President Trump and the economy after the GOP failed to replace the Affordable Care Act, raising questions over when the administration might be able to carry out its plans for tax reform and deregulation. But CEO Jamie Dimon said it's ""silly"" to expect a new president not to have some growing pains.Estimates: EPS up 13% to $1.52, with revenue up 3% to $24.876 billion.Results: EPS of $1.65 on revenue of $25.59 billion. Markets revenue increased 13.9%. Investment banking revenue jumped 34%.

""That would be silly.""In JPMorgan's annual report released this month, the company said that while regulations were too complex, the U.S. was ""probably stronger than ever before."" However, it also said ""it is clear that something is wrong — and it's holding us back.""Stock: Shares rallied 1.7% in morning trading on the stock market today.

Investors will want to know how banks are faring so far this year, but pay attention to what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other bank executives say about the economy and Trump's impact on business's ""animal spirits.""Bank stocks have been drags on the Dow and S&P 500 index since early March, as concerns about Trump's tax cuts mount. Treasury yields have fallen below 2.3% to their lowest levels since November.Infrastructure stocks such as cement, steel and construction-related firms also have lost their postelection boom. Steel stocks crashed with iron prices on Wednesday.Applied Optoelectronics should soar on blowout preliminary Q1 figures released after Wednesday's close. Applied Opto leapt 20% late Wednesday, with Lumentum (LITE), Finisar (FNSR) and others following in sympathy. But will other fiber-optic stocks sustain that rebound in the regular session after the once-hot sector's sell-off this month?Finally, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) will release earnings early Thursday as well. Taiwan Semi is believed to be an Apple iPhone chip supplier. Apple-tied chip stocks have sold off this week amid reports that the iPhone maker may cut ties with a second chip supplier and bring that work in house. Now Taiwan Semi may offer hope or concern about Apple (AAPL), which has received a long run of bullish analyst comments this year.Taiwan Semi fell 0.4% on Wednesday, but found support near its 50-day line and held above its buy point.Apple edged up 0.1% to 141.80, ending a recent downtrend. But for a second straight session shares undercut a recent 141.12 buy point intraday.A big reason why the market uptrend has continued in 2017 is because big-cap techs such as Apple and Amazon.com (AMZN) have taken up leadership. If Apple, the world's most valuable company and biggest component of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq, struggles, it will be a big drag on the major averages.Asian markets were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei down 1.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.1%.

"
245,WFC,"Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and two other big banks, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), report first-quarter earnings on Thursday, as higher rates from the Fed seem likely while President Trump's legislative agenda stalls.Broadly, analysts see a decent first quarter for the banks. But maybe not as decent as once expected as the postelection ""animal spirits"" that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average higher become tamer.The Fed's actual or planned rate hikes could help banks' net interest margins — the difference between the interest banks make on loans and what they pay to depositors — as those extra costs get passed onto consumers who need credit. Fixed-income trading will also likely be solid.But the GOP's botched attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act has thrown the timing for the administration's other policy goals, like tax cuts and the slashing-away of regulations, up in the air. President Trump on Tuesday said that he may work to end Dodd-Frank rules, but the announcement did nothing for bank stocks.JPMorgan shares dipped 0.2% on the stock market today after seeping through the bottom of a flat base intraday. Citigroup lost 0.4%, and Wells Fargo fell 0.7%. Bank of America (BAC), Dow stock Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which report next week, were down less than 1%.The banks' earnings will also come as expectations grow a little more conservative for trading revenue overall and loan growth. Red flags are flying in the auto loan sector as auto sales peter out, and March jobs figures also came in far below estimates.""Commercial borrowers still need clarity from Washington on employee healthcare costs, regulation and tax reform,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note on Monday. ""So we think many commercial borrowers are on hold until they can get more certainty on these topics.""Wall Street expects JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings per share to climb 13% to $1.52, with revenue rising 3% to $24.876 billion.As KBW noted Monday, JPMorgan at its investor day said it expected only a modest bump in trading results. The investment firm said there could be ""some noise in the quarter"" surrounding credit conditions due to delays in tax refunds. But it said the credit environment overall was likely ""benign"" and that residential mortgage trends were likely to remain solid.Investors will also be seeking any color from CEO Jamie Dimon on the economic and political climate in the U.S. and abroad. While U.S. banks have capitalized on a retreat from their European counterparts, the U.K.'s move to formally trigger an exit from the European Union could also create upheaval for the financial world.In JPMorgan's annual report, released last week, the bank said it was preparing for a hard exit from the U.K. The company also said it suspected there would ""constant pressure"" from the European Union ""not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries.""The bank in that report also noted the rising sentiment against globalism. But it said that the U.S. trade agreement with Mexico helped guard the nation against populist anger. And it said ""there is no inevitable or compelling reason that China and America have to clash,"" despite the trade issues between the two nations.The bank also remained optimistic about the U.S., but said ""it is clear that something is wrong — and it's holding us back.""Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's EPS to dip 2% to 97 cents, with revenue up 0.5% to $22.309 billion.Wells' results arrive on the heels of a six-month investigation by an oversight committee into the high-pressure sales practices that led to last year's fake-account debacle, in which the bank was accused of creating unauthorized accounts in consumers' names.The bank has settled claims over the matter and ended sales goals in its retail banking division — that is, the division that offers loans and credit cards to people. But it has struggled to regain consumer trust. Openings of consumer checking accounts fell 43% in February.The committee's findings, released Monday, found flaws in the bank's decentralized structure, which it said gave too much independence to leadership that was unwilling to address the problem and foisted blame elsewhere.""It was common to blame employees who violated Wells Fargo's rules without analyzing what caused or motivated them to do so,"" the report said. ""Effect was confused with cause.""The bank also announced that it would claw back an additional $75 million total from John Stumpf, the bank's former CEO who stepped down last year, and Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells' community banks.But KBW said the report unearthed nothing new, a positive for the bank, so the scandal could be less of a focus during the earnings call than in months past. The firm also said that Wells' margins could be better than its peers' average.Analysts expect Citigroup, which is more internationally exposed than its rivals, to get a 12% boost in EPS to $1.23. Revenue is expected to creep up 1% to $17.763 billion. Some in the analyst community have expressed concerns about Citi's potential vulnerability to growing protectionism.""We believe Citi's emerging market exposure is manageable at this point because we fall in the camp that global reflation will occur and emerging markets risks will not emerge near term,"" KBW said in its report last week.""In fact,"" KBW said, ""should we see a meaningful pickup in global growth, then emerging market growth could accelerate and that would be a positive for Citi's revenues that are not fully reflected in our estimates.""RELATED:Fed Hikes Interest Rates But Doesn't Signal Faster Tightening PaceBanks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

246,WFC,"U.S. stock indexes battled to nice gains Monday afternoon, but something was missing: strong volume, which would've pointed to institutional support.The Nasdaq rose 0.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 trailed with a 0.5% pop. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply lower on both major exchanges. Two of the biggest gainers among secondary indexes were the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, up 1.1%, and the Philadelphia semiconductor index, up 0.9%.Among the big, money-center stocks, Wells Fargo (WFC) surged more than 2% as it bounced off its 200-day line.

Morgan Stanley will report first quarter results Wednesday.Morgan Stanley gets a respectable 90 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup. Homebuilder stocks, which have been rising in the industry group ranks, did well Monday. D.R. Horton (DHI) inched close to a 34.16 buy point, but volume was low and the stock couldn't quite clear the entry. D.R. Horton's base is first stage. A breakout from a first- or second-stage base is more likely to work than those from a later stage.Blue chips were up by a 14-1 ratio in the Dow industrial average. Nike (NKE) rose 1.6%, but volume was soft. Boeing (BA) was close behind with a 1.4% gain.The iShares Gold Trust (IAU) exchange traded fund slipped to a 0.1% loss. Going into Monday's session, the gold play had risen in nine of the past 10 sessions.RELATED:Netflix Earnings After The Close: What The Street ExpectsWhat The Stats Say About The Market's Next MoveHow To Track The General Market Direction: See The Big Picture

247,WFC,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen sounded a slightly hawkish tone on Tuesday, warning about the risk of monetary policy becoming too accommodative.In her semiannual monetary report to Congress, Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee: ""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.After the release of her remarks at 10 a.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average shifted from fractional losses to slim gains on the stock market today. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.47%, rebounding over its 50-day line, while short-end Treasury yields also rose, along with the dollar.Shares of bank stocks, which could benefit from higher rates, pointed higher. Bank of America (BAC) rose 2.8% to its best levels since November 2008. Wells Fargo (WFC) advanced 1.6%, Citigroup (C) 1.5%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) perked up 1.6%, hitting an all-time high. Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 1.3%, near its late 2007 peak. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are components on the Dow industrials, which set a fresh record high on Tuesday.Yellen's overall tone was balanced and offered no clear indication of whether 2017 is likely to see two rate hikes, as markets currently expect, or three, as Fed member projections indicated in December.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's fiscal plans may not have much of an impact on Federal Reserve policy this year. Wall Street increasingly sees any real impact of stimulus being pushed into 2018 and the White House hasn't even unveiled its phenomenal mystery tax-cut Plan B.Still, Yellen's language was a bit surprising after she spent most of last year talking about asymmetric risks being to the downside, since the Fed has little traditional ammunition with its key rate still near zero. On Tuesday, Yellen sounded more like she did in 2015, when the Fed wanted to be proactive to avoid getting too far behind the curve.Previously, Yellen has said that it's not clear the economy needs stimulus to reach full employment. She made clear that she wouldn't offer any advice to Congress except to use any stimulus to boost productivity and not ignore the longer-run budget problems.Despite analyst talk that Yellen put a March hike on the table, fed funds futures point to an 18% chance of a move next month, up from 13% on Monday. The odds of an early May hike inched up to nearly 41% from 36.5%. Markets are still betting on the first hike in June.RELATED:Dow Stocks JPMorgan, Goldman Rise As Fed Signals More HawkishnessFed Is In No Rush To Hike With Eyes On Trump Agenda

249,WFC,"The stock market closed mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average lagging the major indexes.The Dow closed 0.2% lower while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.2%. The S&P and Nasdaq erased mild losses earlier in the day, continuing a pattern of mild price changes.Small caps lagged again, with the Russell 2000 dropping about 0.2%. Volume was moderately higher, according to early figures. Winners led losers by a 9-to-7 ratio on the NYSE and by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.After the close, cybersecurity company Qualys (QLYS) slid in extended trading. The company's fourth-quarter sales missed views and its guidance was weak. Chipmaker MaxLinear (MXL) also tumbled after hours. Its Q4 results beat estimates but the Q1 revenue forecast was light.There was some cheer for the struggling retail sector. Department stores, discount shops, apparel chains, restaurants and auto parts stores were among the 12 best-performing industry groups in today's market.Some retail stocks fell earlier Wednesday after President Trump took to Twitter to attack Nordstrom (JWN) for dropping his daughter Ivanka's fashion line. But Nordstrom shares rose in late trading and closed with a 4% increase.Nearly all eight stocks that make up the department-stores group were up, though they are barely starting to recover from 52-week lows or worse.The retail sector has deeper problems than Trump tweets or political boycotts. Brick-and-mortar stores continue to be pressured by Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online sellers.The mobile-home and RV industry also led, as Thor Industries (THO) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. The RV manufacturer surged past the 106.43 buy point and closed in buy range. But the base is a later-stage pattern, and volume was less than enthusiastic on the breakout. An analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. upgraded Thor to outperform from neutral, citing optimism among dealers and upside potential on margins, according to TheFly.com.Steel, heavy-construction and some other cyclical stocks lagged. Banks and financials also were weak as bond yields continued to drop, threatening margins.

251,WFC,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

252,WFC,"XPresident Trump's directionless policy agenda and his bear hug of dovish Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen are wreaking havoc on market expectations, with an assist from international uncertainty.The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday sank to 2.23%, a level not seen since the week after Trump's election. Wells Fargo (WFC) tumbled 3.3% to its worst close since Nov. 9, the first day of the postelection rally, after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue. Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) cleared analyst estimates with their first-quarter reports, but saw modest early gains turn into losses of about 1%, with both stocks stuck below their 50-day averages.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index both appeared headed for a third straight lower close as weakness continued to extend beyond financials to infrastructure stocks, another group that soared on the Trump agenda. The Dow, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite are all trading below their 50-day moving averages.Dow construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT) slipped 1.9%, while steel maker U.S. Steel (X) tumbled 5.9%. U.S. Steel crashed 10% on Wednesday, its worst loss in nearly a year, as steel makers and miners plunged with iron ore prices.IBD'S TAKE: While the stock market rally has stalled out in the U.S., emerging markets stocks are rallying. Learn why they're rising, and which emerging markets are outperforming their peers.This week's action appears to represent the biggest reversal of the Trump effect to date. The reversal is more obvious in the Treasury market, where yields have fallen to their lowest levels in almost five months, than in equity markets that are still not too far from the lofty postelection peaks. Perhaps the clearest evidence of the change is visible in Fed rate expectations.Despite the Fed's stated intention to raise rates twice more this year and also to begin unwinding its balance sheet by a change in its reinvestment policy, which represents a third tightening, markets are now only pricing one more hike this year, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. What's more, the second rate hike isn't seen until at least March of 2018. That's basically where expectations stood before Trump's election led the Fed to take a hawkish shift.Trump's announcement this week that he is putting repeal of ObamaCare back at the top of his agenda, even though prospects for success look negligible, seem to have cemented doubts that Trump will be able to enact pro-growth tax cuts and infrastructure. That's a bitter pill for investors who had been banking on big corporate tax cuts in the Trump era.The White House also revealed this week that it is undertaking a broad search for options to offset the cost of tax reform. While the possibility of success can't be completely ruled out, the outcome will likely hinge on whether Trump can get near-unanimous support among GOP senators for a big deficit-increasing tax cut at a time of high and rising debt levels.The latest blow to Fed expectations and banks came when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in a Wednesday interview that he liked low interest rates and would consider reappointing Yellen as chair at the end of her term in February 2018. There are three Fed governor openings that Trump has to fill, and there's now substantial doubt that he'll appoint any hawks. That's quite a surprise, considering that Trump said Yellen's low rates had created a ""big fat, ugly bubble"" during the campaign. Prospects for faster growth and higher rates that allow for a wider margin between lending and borrowing rates had made banks among the big winners of the Trump rally.RELATED:Stock Rally Tiring As Trump Policy Agenda Runs In CirclesThis 'Explosive' Protectionist Signal From Trump Looks Like A Dud

The maker of luxury battery-powered cars announced it would launch its first tractor-trailer-type truck in September. The move put Tesla shares 6% above a 287.49 buy point from a cup base.Makers of fiber-optic networking gear continued their rally, led by Applied Optoelectronics' (AAOI) 11% gain. The move left the stock still below its 10-week moving average, and down 25% from its March 27 high after two weeks of brisk selling.Biotechs posted a strong session that sent La Jolla Pharmaceutical (LJPC) and Axovant Science (AXON) each up about 10%. Axovant streamed 45% higher for the week, after announcing Monday that former Medivation CEO David Hung would take over the chief executive's seat as Vivek Ramaswamy moves up to lead Axovant's parent, Roivant Sciences.Steel- and oil-related industry groups turned in eight of Thursday's 10 worst performances among industries, despite fairly flat oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate closing at 53.18 — up nearly 2% for the week. Chevron (CVX) clocked the largest decline among Dow industrials, down nearly 3%.Among the big banks reporting first-quarter earnings, JPMorgan (JPM) took a 1.2% loss, Citgroup (C) dropped 0.8% and Wells Fargo (WFC) tumbled by more than 3%.China's TAL Education Group (TAL) topped the IBD 50, rising 4%.

254,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon indicated he was willing to give the Trump administration more time to carry out its economic agenda, while top executives at the largest U.S. bank by assets and at Citigroup (C) grappled with the potential revival of Depression-era regulations.The remarks come after the failure by the White House and GOP-controlled Congress to replace the Affordable Care Act raised questions about when the administration could execute on tax reform and deregulation.""You all should expect, as a given, that when you have a new president, and they get going, that the nine months after the 100 days is gonna be a sausage-making period,"" Dimon told analysts on JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings call. ""There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that.""But he said Trump's plans for tax cuts, looser regulations and infrastructure spending could help all Americans if enacted. CFO Marianne Lake said a business-friendly agenda would eventually translate into loan growth, which she said has turned quieter recently.Some analysts had expressed concern that commercial borrowers could be more cautious as policy goals risk getting mangled in Congress.Dimon said not to ""overreact"" to issues surrounding loan growth, saying companies had other options for expansion. He noted JPMorgan's credit-card segment looked ""OK,""  while mortgages saw obvious effects from higher rates and that auto loans are getting hit by auto sales, which flagged in March.Overall, Dimon remained upbeat on the economy.""U.S. consumers and businesses are healthy overall and with pro-growth initiatives and improving collaboration between government and business, the U.S. economy can continue to improve,"" he said in a statement.Meanwhile, despite hopes for bank deregulation under Trump, White House economic advisor Gary Cohn reportedly expressed support for something akin to a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law that separated commercial and investment banking that was repealed in 1999.In response, Lake said JPMorgan's diversified business model was ""a source of strength"" for the company and financial markets during the financial crisis. She also said separating the bank's businesses doesn't feel ""consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the U.S.""Meanwhile, Citigroup's CFO, John Gerspach, also said he wanted more clarity about where the administration stood on Glass-Steagall, whose repeal, many argue, contributed to the gutting banks experienced during the crisis.Shares of JPMorgan reversed lower as falling Treasury yields squeezed the yield curve, sending the bank's stock down 1.2% on the stock market today. Citigroup dipped 0.8%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) tumbled 3.3%. Goldman Sachs (GS), which reports next week, lost 1.1%. Bank of America (BAC), also reporting next week, fell 1.4%.JPMorgan's Q1 earnings per share jumped 22% to $1.65, above estimates for $1.52. Revenue rose 6% to $25.59 billion, topping views for $24.876 billion. Investment banking revenue jumped 34%, helped by strong IPO activity. Markets revenue rose 13%, with equities up 2% and fixed-income revenue up 17%.March ended up being better than expected, reflecting ""some recovery in volatility,"" Lake said, with market activity picking up in response to European elections and the stronger interest-rate outlook in the U.S.Meanwhile, Citigroup said EPS jumped 23% to $1.35, beating estimates for $1.23. Revenue rose 3% to $18.1 billion, above forecasts for $17.757 billion. Investment banking revenue surged 39% to $1.21 billion. Markets revenue grew 18%, with equities up 10% and fixed income climbing 19% to $3.62 billion.Wells Fargo's EPS rose 1% to $1, beating views for 97 cents, while revenue of $22 billion missed views for $22.315 billion. Auto loan originations sank 29% to $5.5 billion on tighter underwriting standards. Home loan originations plunged to $44 billion from $72 billion in prior quarter.Bank stocks have slipped from their postelection highs, and Trump's comments Wednesday about the dollar being ""too strong"" could weigh on Treasury rates.However, JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said banks could hit a ""sweet spot"" as the Federal Reserve gets more bullish on raising interest rates.""What I mean by that is, with the potential for rates to rise … and the historically low rates we're still in the middle of, they may start to see even more demand for loans as people want to lock in the rates for a longer period of time,"" he said. The better trends in equities could also bode well for the market overall, he said.Still, he cautioned that JPMorgan's decision to set aside more reserves for consumer credit was something to keep an eye on. Wells Fargo's weaker results in its large mortgage business in Q1 could also be a concern as it tries to repair its reputation following a massive sham-account scandal.If nothing else, he noted, the bank still managed to beat EPS estimates.""In a turbulent internal environment, they've still delivered overall,"" Kinahan said.
"
255,WFC,"Bank stocks like Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) got a lift Tuesday after Fed Chair Janet Yellen appeared to leave open the possibility to a rate hike in March, suggested the economy is now at full employment, and warned waiting too long for a rate hike would be ""unwise.""But she said it's too early to know how the new administration's policies would play out and how they would affect the economy, according to prepared remarks for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.Yellen did, however, say that the unemployment rate was ""now in line"" with the median of Fed policymakers' ""estimates of its longer-run normal level."" Last month, Yellen said unemployment was near that level. That may signal the Fed will take a more hawkish stance to prevent the job market from overheating and stoking inflation.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.6% to 89.56 on the stock market today, hitting a record intraday high. Goldman Sachs rose 1.3% to 249.46, the highest since its all-time highset in 2007 and still within buy range from a 245.67 buy point. Bank of America (BAC), whose more U.S.-centric operations mean it stands to gain more from higher rates, climbed 2.8% to its best levels since late 2008.Citigroup (C) added 1.5%, after reclaiming support at its 50-day line a day earlier. Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 1.7%. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied 1.6% to 57.98, clearing a 57.43 buy point.Two-year and 10-year Treasury yields, which influence the value of different types of loans and offer a window into investors' inflation expectations, also rose.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks like JPMorgan, Goldman, Bank of America and Citigroup have risen on hopes President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress will cut regulations and taxes while also making a bigger push to improve U.S. infrastructure. Banks are among the few stocks that benefit when the Fed raises rates to keep borrowing and growth in check.  ""At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate,"" Yellen said in her written testimony.""As I noted on previous occasions,"" she later added, ""waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.""The remarks come after Fed policymakers opted earlier this month to leave target range for the federal funds rate unchanged. The central bank in December raised the rate — which determines interest charged on overnight loans banks make to one another meet the Fed's daily reserve requirements — and forecast three rate hikes this year, up from two.RELATED:JPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

258,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS), which helped send the Dow Jones industrial average above 20,000 last week, fell below its 50-day line and secondary buy point Tuesday, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are testing their 50-day averages amid a market sell-off and concerns on global trade under the Trump administration.Bank stocks surged immediately after the election on hopes for higher interest rates, lighter regulations and faster economic growth. They leveled off in early December but picked up some momentum last week as positive earnings reports lifted investor sentiment. But Goldman shares tumbled 2% to 229.32 on the stock market today, as bond yields also fell, weighing on rates that banks charge on certain balances. The stock tested its 50-day line last week, then bounced higher, representing a follow-on entry point.JPMorgan lost 1.6% and Morgan Stanley 1.5% as they neared their 50-day lines. Bank of America (BAC) shares slid 1.35%, still comfortably above their 50-day.Citigroup (C) shares were off 1.4% to 55.83, falling further below its 50-day. The bank is especially exposed to international markets, which were shaken after President Donald Trump announced his travel ban on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Citi also announced Tuesday that it would merge its media and telecom investment banking units.More U.S.-focused lenders like Wells Fargo (WFC) were less affected, though hopes are fading for a massive infrastructure-spending bill, and the growth hopes that would've come with it, as Democrats in Congress take a harder line against cooperating with Trump amid the travel ban backlash.Shares of Wells Fargo ticked up 0.45% on Tuesday.RELATED: Fed Preview: Policymakers Can't Figure Out Trump, So They Won't TryBreakout Watch: This Bank Stock Outranks BofA, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan

259,WFC,"Investors' money was drawn to Vanguard in 2016 like paper clips to a powerful magnet.Investors were attracted by low costs and many passively run funds that hugged the performances of their benchmarks. The result: Shareholders favored Vanguard with net inflow to its mutual funds that vastly outpaced its rival firms'. Vanguard lured in a net $182.997 billion to its mutual funds, according to Morningstar Inc.All other mutual fund complexes with inflow — there were 314 if them — had combined net inflow of $151 billion.Another 511 complexes had net outflow.The closest single fund family to Vanguard was Dimensional Fund Advisors, which pulled in a relatively paltry net $21.417 billion.Dimensional runs $316.07 billion in assets. Vanguard runs nearly nine times more money in its mutual funds: $2.793 trillion.The flow is the movement of money in and out of open-end mutual funds, excluding money market funds and funds of funds.Several of the industry's largest fund families suffered the heaviest net outflows in 2016.Franklin Templeton Investments (BEN), with $378.66 billion in mutual fund assets, hemorrhaged $43.23 billion in net outflow, the industry's heaviest net redemptions last year.No. 2 in net redemptions was Fidelity Investments, with $1.22 trillion in total net assets in funds, which lost $24.48 billion in net outflow.Bond specialist Pimco, with $286.53 billion in total net assets, had the fourth-most net outflow: $16.83 billion.Two more spots back was Wells Fargo Funds — owned by Wells Fargo (WFC) — which has $92.04 billion in assets and had 2016 $15.45 billion in net redemptions.For Vanguard, it was the third year in a row of increased net inflow to its mutual funds. Net inflow has more than doubled since 2012's $87.069 billion. It was $75.753 billion in 2013.Vanguard, based in Malvern, Pa., has also had a flood of net inflow to its exchange traded funds, totaling $94.26 billion.The combined net inflow of $277.257 billion was massively more net inflow to mutual funds plus ETFs in 2016 than its rivals, according to a recent IBD report.That report also detailed the division between flows to and from the actively run mutual funds and ETFs in each fund family and passive funds.The next largest combined fund-ETF net inflow was $107.822 billion to iShares, the ETF group run by asset management titan BlackRock (BLK). But BlackRock alone bled a net outflow of $8.414 billion — basically, from its mutual funds. So the overall BlackRock/iShares complex had a combined net inflow of $99.431 billion.The third-highest mutual fund-ETF combined inflow went to SPDR State Street Global Advisors, which pulled in a net $54.694 billion.Whether it was flow just to mutual funds or to funds plus ETFs, shareholders largely had low costs on their minds. ""By far, 2016 belonged to Vanguard,"" Morningstar editor Tom Lauricella and senior analyst Alina Lamy noted in a recent report. ""The low-cost juggernaut dominated the flows landscape to a remarkable degree.""The report noted that Fidelity's buildup of index funds in recent years enabled it ""to offset some of the bleeding on the active (management) side of (funds) with $37 billion in index-tracking inflows.""

261,WFC,"Dow components JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks fell Wednesday, testing key support as the 10-year Treasury yield continued its slide.However, the dip in bank stocks comes as analysts expect fatter payouts from banks in the era of President Trump.JPMorgan shares fell 0.9% to 85.96, while Bank of America (BAC) lost 1% to 22.67 and Wells Fargo (WFC) dropped 1.3% to close at 55.63 on the stock market today. Goldman dipped 0.6%. All of those stocks are off session lows as they found support near at their key 50-day lines.Morgan Stanley (MS) retreated 2.2% to 43.91, still maintaining a bit more distance from that line. Citigroup (C) slid 1.5% to 56.32, treading below its 50-day line since January.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell five basis points to 2.35%, near their lowest levels of the year and extending a slide on Monday and Tuesday.The 10-year Treasury yield influences the rate on mortgages and other types of debt, and has eased off highs reached in December. Wider yield spreads between short- and long-term rates boost banks' net interest margins.Yields rise when expectations of inflation and economic growth increase.Bond yields surged after President Trump's election, with investors betting that tax cuts, infrastructure investments, and a shearing away of regulations would cause the economy to heat up, push up wages and prices, and force the Fed to hike rates more frequently to keep growth in check.Banks and other financial stocks got yet another lift last week after Trump took executive action ordering a review of the Dodd-Frank post-crisis financial-reform measures — although any changes would have to come from Congress. He also ordered halt to a rule, set to take hold in April, that would require retirement advisors put their clients' needs above others on the job.Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck, in a research note on Monday, said an easing of regulatory pressure could also help open the taps for banks' capital return plans.Morgan Stanley said that due to a less stressful round of stress tests — the annual evaluation of U.S. banks' ability to keep lending and operating amid potential convulsions to the economy — dividends from the banks it covers could rise 8% and gross buybacks 40% from the third quarter of this year to Q2 of next year.Graseck added that ""we expect buybacks will increase over next several CCAR cycles, along with more capital allocated to lending and banking activities.""IBD'S TAKE: Even though banks have leveled off from their postelection surge, they're still among the only stocks to benefit from higher interest rates. CCAR refers to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, which assesses banks' capital levels and the soundness of banks' capital planning, including shareholder returns. The other test is known as the Dodd-Frank stress test, which evaluates whether banks have enough of a financial cushion to withstand a shock to the system.The guidelines for the latest stress tests, released Friday, exempt 21 banks from the portion of the tests that evaluates their capital plans. This year's ""severely adverse scenario"" for the tests also excludes negative short-term Treasury rates.She estimates that the banks she covers have some $120 billion in ""excess capital,"" led by $29.1 billion held by Citigroup. Bank of America had $21.2 billion in excess capital, while JPMorgan had $19.7 billion.While any changes to Dodd-Frank might not occur until next year, Morgan Stanley said it believed ""significant change on the enforcement of existing regulations can come from the new agency heads who are likely to be appointed over the next 18 months.""A new vice chair of supervision at the Fed ""could drive a more quantitatively oriented approval process to the stress test,"" the firm noted.Results from the stress tests will likely be released closer to the summer.RELATED:U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

264,WFC,"TrumpCare is officially undead.The White House is giving new life to the push to repeal and replace ObamaCare with a move to win over the conservative House holdouts who sank the American Health Care Act late last month. A new vote might come as early as this week.For investors hopeful that President Trump will provide the promised fiscal fuel that sparked the postelection rally in the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, the U-turn back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal isn't encouraging news.The Dow was barely positive in afternoon trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were modestly lower. The broad market uptrend remains under pressure as bank stocks, among the big winners in the Trump rally based on prospects for tax cuts, faster growth and higher interest rates, have fallen below their 50-day moving averages. Most banks were lower on the stock market today, including Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC).Hospital stocks and Medicaid-focused insurers, which had bounced back from a TrumpCare-inspired sell-off when it looked like the legislation that would add 24 million to the ranks of the uninsured was doomed, were under pressure again on Tuesday.Hospital group Tenet Healthcare (THC) lost 2.5%, while HCA Holding (HCA) fell 1.9%. Insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) fell 2.7% and Centene (CNC) 2.65%. Still, the stocks are well above their levels of two weeks ago, a sign that investors may think the revival of ObamaCare repeal is like a reality-show version of ""The Walking Dead.""Instead of quickly moving to tax cuts, as Trump had signaled he would do, he's diving back into what looks like a legislative morass. At best, a renewed effort to repeal ObamaCare likely just means a longer detour for Trump's fiscal plans. But there's already evidence that the ObamaCare battle is sapping consumer confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index out Tuesday fell to 51.7 in April from 55.3 in March, reversing almost all of its postelection rise. At worst, a drawn-out political battle could cut into business optimism and undercut the economy's momentum.IBD'S TAKE: When the stock market's uptrend is under pressure, as it is currently, investors should be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture each day to see whether the uptrend remains intact and check out Leaderboard to find buying opportunities and sell signals for the market's leading stocks.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Tuesday that the White House may have infrastructure legislation ready by the end of May, though infrastructure and tax reform were expected to be in the same package. For now, the Trump administration is still searching for a tax reform Plan B. Amid stiff opposition to House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to raise $1 trillion to pay for tax cuts via a 20% border-adjusted tax on imports, the White House is reportedly looking at a value-added tax or carbon tax though the administration denied they are under consideration.Getting an ObamaCare repeal bill out of the House — if it happens — would be a walk in the park compared to the challenge that awaits in the Senate, where the GOP can stand to lose just two votes, but a half-dozen lawmakers have signaled opposition to rolling back ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.The White House has reportedly agreed to give ground on a key demand of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, granting states the opportunity to opt out of ObamaCare's community-rating regulation that requires insurers to charge the same price to the sick and the healthy. The Trump administration would grant waivers to states, if they can show that nixing the regulation would reduce premiums and result in more people being covered.The revived push to repeal ObamaCare adds to the uncertainty facing individual-market insurers who need to set premiums for 2018 ObamaCare exchange coverage within the next two months. Anthem (ANTM), which reportedly intends to exit many of its exchange markets, is the only ObamaCare insurer in 200 counties, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Many ObamaCare exchange markets weren't thriving before Trump took office, and this year's spike in premiums may have prompted many unsubsidized customers to drop their coverage, according to one report. The extra stress from the Trump administration's efforts to undercut the law and give people a pass from complying with the individual mandate appears likely to set off a crisis this summer, as some parts of the country find themselves without any insurance options for the coming year.In other words, Trump is playing with fire in a drought zone. If a blaze breaks out, tax cuts may be starved of oxygen.RELATED:Caterpillar Lifts Dow With Goldman Push; Trump Readies Infrastructure Bill Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?The Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And TradeTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

265,WFC,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index fell to 51.7 in April, down from 55.3 in March. After hitting a 12-year high of 56.4 in February, optimism has fallen almost all the way back to where it was at the start of November, before the surprise election of Donald Trump.The polling, from March 24-30, came after President Trump pulled the plug on House Speaker Paul Ryan's bill that would have repealed and replaced ObamaCare but potentially increased the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index at the start of April remained just above its pre-Trump level, 51.7 vs. 51.3, and holding above the neutral 50 level. Yet two of the IBD/TIPP Poll's three major subindexes, optimism about the six-month economic outlook and satisfaction with government economic policies, have fallen below their pre-election levels. The third subindex, a gauge of optimism about personal financial prospects, remains moderately above its pre-Trump level, undoubtedly helped by the postelection rally in the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.The question for markets will be what to make of the sudden drop in Trump-fueled economic optimism. It's possible that the decline could be a fleeting response to the failed GOP effort to repeal ObamaCare, or it could signal lower confidence that Trump will enact a positive economic agenda.The risk is that a pullback in economic optimism will carry over to the business sector, paving the way for a soft patch in activity after a burst of hiring and a ramping up of manufacturing activity.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield fell to a one-month low of 2.34%, the lowest level since Federal Reserve policymakers surprised markets by indicating that a quarter-point interest-rate hike was coming at the March 15 meeting.The Nasdaq composite briefly hit a record high Monday morning, but reversed lower. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index finished slightly in the red after finding support at their 50-day moving averages.Disappointing March auto sales from General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and others seemed to carry more weight with investors than another strong report on manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management. U.S. auto sales sank to a two-year low, as GM inventories surged.""The unexpected dip in March auto sales is the latest hard data release to suggest that the Trump reflation trade may have run its course,"" wrote Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho, noting that the auto sector had been ""a big part of the upside momentum in the economy.""Still, bank stocks, which stand to benefit from faster growth, higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve, bounced back from a midmorning bout of selling on Monday. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) finished unchanged, while Wells Fargo (WFC) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) each lost 0.3%. BofA, Wells Fargo and Goldman are all trading below their 50-day lines.IBD'S TAKE: Infighting among Republicans amid high and rising public debt levels is diminishing the prospects for President Trump's tax cuts and infrastructure spending.While the headline reading of the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index no longer shows a clear Trump effect, the change in the White House is still obvious below the surface. Among Democrats, optimism slid further to 35.8, down from 61.6 just before the election and the lowest since July 2008. Among Republicans, optimism has pulled back to 72.8 from 80.4 in February, but remains far above its pre-Trump level of 44.3.The optimism reading among independents has fallen to 48.6 vs. a January peak of 56.7 and almost back to the 47.5 just before Election Day.Poll respondents with income below $50,000 a year are more pessimistic about the economy than before the election, while those above $50,000 are more optimistic. In November, men and women were equally optimistic (51.4). Now optimism among men is 10 points higher than among women (56.7 vs. 46.7), an unprecedented gap in the history of the IBD/TIPP Poll.Likewise, optimism among self-described investors is 7.4 points higher than among noninvestors, a record gap that underscores the importance of the Trump stock market rally on confidence.In April, the gauge of the six-month economic outlook fell to 51.1, down from 53.6 in March and 52.2 in early November.The personal financial outlook index slipped 1.3 points in April to 61.3, still higher than November's 58.9 reading.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies slumped 7 points to 42.6, even worse than November's 43.1 reading. The index had signaled optimism for the first time in a decade in February.RELATED:Trump Support Plunges In Latest IBD/TIPP PollIBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership IndexU.S. Auto Sales Fall To 2-Year Low As GM Inventories SwellISM Manufacturing Index Dips To 57.2, But Factory Jobs SpikeThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade
"
266,WFC,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Monday eased to 57.2 in March, a modest deceleration after the gauge of factory activity hit a 30-month high in February.Wall Street economists expected the ISM gauge to dip to 57.0 from 57.7 in January. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened higher on Monday, with the Nasdaq briefly hitting an all-time high. But after the ISM report, the major averages reversed lower. Treasury yields edged lower.The new orders index slipped to 64.5 from a longtime high of 65.1, while the current production gauge slid to 57.6 from 62.9. The employment gauge jumped 4.7 points to 58.9, a six-year high.The strengthening in manufacturing activity comes despite question marks for the auto sector.General Motors (GM) reported weaker-than-expected March auto sales Monday morning, with Ford (F) reporting a hefty decline. General Motors and Ford shares fell in morning trade on the stock market today.The broad auto sector has been hit in recent weeks by concerns about falling used car prices and other signs of flagging demand.March U.S. auto sales are expected to rise 3% to a 17.4 million annual rate, amid higher discounts and other customer incentives compared to a year ago, says Kelly Blue Book.The ISM report starts off a batch of key economic reports this week, including Friday's jobs report. The data may begin to show whether economic momentum is being sustained after the initial burst in business confidence after the surprise election of Donald Trump. The data could begin to shift expectations for the trajectory of Federal Reserve rate hikes.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla, jobs and factory data, and a summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping lead this week's investing action plan. Make sure you get the plan for each trading day.After giving more hawkish signals in early March, Fed policymakers' forecasts issued at the March 15 meeting signaled two more rate hikes to come this year. Markets are pricing in one hike in June and another in December.The 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back due to the combination of a patient fed and creeping doubts about President Trump's ability to get tax and infrastructure spending through Congress. That's been a negative for banks, which can reap bigger profits from faster growth, higher rates and a steeper yield curve. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) all slipped below their 50-day moving averages last week.RELATED:Dow Average, S&P 500 Fall As Wall Street Awaits Tax Reform Plan BFord U.S. Auto Sales Fall, GM Inventories SwellFord Guides Q1 Earnings Well Below Views In Latest Flat Tire For Industry

272,WFC,"XNearly a week after the GOP effort to repeal ObamaCare crashed and burned, President Trump's pivot to tax reform and infrastructure spending is off to an inauspicious start.On Thursday, Trump fired off a critical tweet aimed at the House Freedom Caucus, and two members of the conservative group returned fire.The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017For Wall Street, which is hoping that the president will be able to deliver the fiscal fuel that has helped propel the postelection stock market rally, Trump's tweet raises concerns on two fronts. First, Trump sounds as if negotiating with Democrats may have been just a threat, rather than a serious option to move legislation. Second, he clearly hasn't patched up differences with the conservative group, and that may not bode well for his future legislative deal making.But in afternoon trading on the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were trying to extend the bounceback rally to a third straight session. Still, Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) outperformed the market. The financial sector is among the big potential beneficiaries of the Trump agenda's goal of lower tax rates, faster growth and the likely byproduct of higher interest rates. Bank of America rose 2.2% to just below its 50-day line, while JPMorgan advanced 0.9% to nudge back above that key support level. Wells Fargo climbed 1% but is still below its 50-day. Citigroup is putting that line behind it, rising 1.9% in a march toward eight-year highs.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market's uptrend remained under pressure amid modest gains on lower volume on Wednesday. Read IBD's The Big Picture each day to see if the uptrend remains intact and visit IBD Leaderboard to see whether it's a good time to buy or take profits on the market's leading stocks.While the potential of the Trump agenda to drive economic growth may be diminishing, the Commerce Department's upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday showed that the economy is in somewhat better shape than expected. As GDP growth was bumped up to 2.1% in the quarter vs. the prior report of 1.9%, consumer spending was revised up to 3.5% growth from 3%.The biggest problem for Trump may be the unforgiving budget math that the Congressional Budget Office highlighted on Thursday with its new Long-Term Budget Outlook. CBO said that publicly held federal debt is on track to reach 150% of GDP in 30 years, up from 77% now. Over the same period, deficits would rise from 2.9% of GDP to 9.8% of GDP.Large and growing debt levels ""would hurt the economy,"" increase debt-service expense and increase the likelihood of a fiscal crisis, CBO said.Here's why this matters for Trump: The RyanCare debacle has basically killed the possibility of comprehensive tax reform, which pays for lower income tax rates by closing loopholes or raising other taxes. The main mechanism for paying for tax cuts was supposed to be House Speaker Paul Ryan's 20% border-adjusted tax on imports. But that looked like a nonstarter in the Senate even before the rejection of Ryan's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The possibility of the GOP embracing yet another unpopular Ryan policy has evaporated.That means any sizable package of tax cuts is likely to substantially increase the deficit. It also means that the tax cuts would sunset after 10 years, just like the 2001 cuts under George W. Bush, because reconciliation can't be used for bills that increase deficits after 10 years. The big unknown is whether Trump can find 50 of 52 Republican senators who will vote to increase the deficit at a time of high and rising debt levels.The answer may not be clear until Republicans are able to produce a 10-year budget. In the past, conservatives have insisted on a budget that eventually balances, but that will be a tall task, given the $1.4 trillion fiscal 2027 deficit projected by CBO and Trump's opposition to cutting Social Security and Medicare. Even if tax reform is deficit-financed, any budget that can pass muster among conservatives is likely to have the appearance of paying for lower taxes with future cuts to entitlement programs.RELATED:Dow Average Bounces Even As Trump Floats Risky Tax-Cut StrategyStocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans

276,WFC,"XThe House pulled a Friday vote on the ObamaCare repeal-and-replace legislation shortly before the market close. Stocks rebounded somewhat from session lows as the bill seemed doomed to defeatThe Dow Jones industrial average pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite is up 0.2%.Fading prospects for repealing ObamaCare seemed to kneecap Thursday's rally, when the major averages all finished in the red. Two days earlier, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all suffered their steepest one-day losses since the fall, as conservatives began to close ranks against Ryan's American Health Care Act (AHCA).The Dow industrials fell 1.5% for the week, its worst loss since Trump was elected.House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking shortly after the market close, said he and President Trump agreed to scrap the vote after they ""came up short."" Ryan signaled the ObamaCare repeal effort is over for now, with attention shifting to tax cuts. He said tax reform is ""more difficult"" now after the health care defeat, but not impossible. Trump also said that tax reform is likely next on tap.If the ObamaCare repeal effort is dead, some analysts has predicted a continued rough spell for financials but a potential bounce for beaten-down hospital stocks. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and many other financials have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare. On Friday, Wells Fargo rose 1%, while Goldman Sachs lost 1.5% and BofA was up 0.2%.Meanwhile, hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) rose 7.4% and 3.4% respectively, Friday, adding to Thursday's rebound.Reports coming out of the White House had suggested Trump would be just fine to see it sink. Wall Street isn't sure, but it may soon come around.While Trump's morning tweet to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus signaled he was still trying to round up votes, he's eager to move onto the more popular parts of his agenda — tax cuts and infrastructure spending — and reportedly regrets leading off with ObamaCare repeal.IBD'S TAKE: Up until now, financial markets have been happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's because, with all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.Those growth-fueling parts of Trumponomics are what primarily sparked the postelection stock market rally. Yet Wall Street has been worried that failure on health care would cast doubt on the GOP's ability to deliver on the rest of its agenda.""If they fail at this then the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure and defense spending will need to be rethought,"" wrote Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho chief U.S. economist, in a Friday note. ""Failure to pass the GOP bill sets the stage for the equity markets to retest the 2250-2300 level (on the S&P 500) and move the yield on the 10-year back toward the 2.2% level. We believe passage will result in a relief rally in stocks back to the 2400 level, and a sell-off in the 10-year note to reverts toward 2.5-2.6% again.""Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets sees the dollar weakening further if Trump's fiscal policy takes a loss on health care.While it's possible, maybe even likely, that markets would react negatively at first, if RyanCare dies, the gloom is unlikely to last for long. The reason: It's becoming increasingly clear that ObamaCare repeal is doomed, whether it dies today or in the Senate.""Our base-case is that the AHCA passes the House, with a likely thin majority, but is ultimately voted down by the Senate and/or placed on the back burner by the Republican leadership in order to focus upon tax reform,"" Citi analysts wrote in a Thursday note.The main question, then, is whether RyanCare fails quickly, allowing for a quick shift to drawing up tax cuts, or whether it dies a slow death, which would be the most negative outcome for markets.The reason that Wall Street is divided about the impact of ObamaCare repeal failure is that tax reform looks to be just as complicated as health care reform. Yet, if RyanCare crashes and burns, there's little chance that the GOP will have the stomach to tackle tax reform centered on Ryan's controversial border-adjusted 20% tax on imports.Expect a quick shift from tax reform to tax cuts. The real impact of failure on ObamaCare repeal would be to increase the urgency of tax cuts to save the GOP from a 2018 election debacle. With their backs to the wall, there's a strong chance that Republicans would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut. Acting quickly could allow the GOP to make some tax cuts retroactive to 2017, meaning the payoff for voters would come before Election Day in 2018.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring just a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than deficit neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience, and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare. It's also unclear how the Federal Reserve and financial markets would respond to a big fiscal stimulus and higher deficits. Higher rates and uncertainty over the future of tax rates also might reduce the effectiveness of tax cuts to a significant extent.RELATED:Stocks Fall On Health Care Vote Delay; CBO Scores Revised BillThe Bull Case For Tax Cuts If ObamaCare Repeal FailsTrump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

284,WFC,"Half of the 18 components of IBD's ETF Sector Rotation index are financials, which gives you an idea just how strong the sector has been performing.One of the new faces in that batch is iShares U.S. Financial Services (IYG), a fund with a more-diversified profile than the various banking ETFs in the index, but one that still draws most of its strength from banks.Nearly 60% of the fund is in big banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) plus many small regional players. But the fund expands its scope with more than 30% of holdings in financial services firms such as NYSE operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and BlackRock (BLK), which happens to be the parent of the iShares family of ETFs.About 10% of the portfolio is categorized as software, where credit card companies Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are found.The fund differs from its larger cousin, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), in a couple of significant ways. Financial Select Sector has about two-thirds as many holdings and they're generally bigger stocks. The average market cap for Financial Select Sector is $89.6 billion, compared with $69.5 billion for iShares U.S. Financial, according to Morningstar.A great many of the 110 stocks in the iShares fund are near the 10-week moving average, including most of the largest holdings. Similarly, iShares U.S. Financial Services is testing support as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. A rebound from its current level would create a buy area for the ETF.The outlook for the financial sector is improving, as the first round of earnings has been mostly favorable. But uncertainly over tax proposals rattled bank stocks the past week.Financial are reporting the second-highest earnings growth of all 11 S&P sectors, 16.2% as of a week ago, according to a report from FactSet Research. Insurance companies are expected to have the highest earnings growth at 45%, followed by Capital Markets at 29%.""At the company level, AIG (AIG), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America are the largest contributors to earnings growth for this sector,"" FactSet noted.But financial stocks have been following a couple of other important trends. First, bond yields have been climbing as the Federal Reserve weans the U.S. economy off an easy monetary policy. Second, Republicans in Congress have a chance to unwind or eliminate regulations that have dampened bank profits. In fact, the Nov. 8 election sparked a rally in the fund that resulted in a 13.7% surge in November, its best month since April 2009.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

286,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) — the latter of which topped Q4 forecasts Tuesday morning — and other banks fell after President-elect Donald Trump signaled opposition to a key piece of the GOP's tax strategy, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, threatening hopes for anticipated tax cuts.The slide comes as investors wait for more clarity on what Trump's plans might actually look like after they get batted around in Congress. Such policy details, Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby noted, might not begin to surface until the second half of the year.""You're getting more disconnect between what different Republicans want,"" he said.Lower bond yields also weighed Tuesday, and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's speech indicating a so-called ""hard Brexit"" to separate the country from the EU added to uncertainty over London's future as a banking hub.Even as Morgan Stanley solidly beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, the outlook for the industry has continued to overshadow its actual results.""These earnings are trivial in relation to the perception that's driving the stocks right now,"" Mosby said.Shares of Morgan Stanley closed down 3.8% to 42.15 on the stock market today. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup (C), which report Wednesday, were down 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America, which reported earnings last week, fell 3.6% and 4.2%. Wells Fargo (WFC), which also reported last week and plans to more than double its branch closures this year, fell 2.8%.Bank stocks initially took off after the election on hopes the incoming administration and GOP-controlled Congress will cut regulations, grow the economy and create a higher-interest-rate environment. But the sector began to level off last month as the rise in bond yields have slowed.JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo shares are approaching their fast-rising 50-day lines for the first time in months, as the 10-year Treasury yield threatens to close below that key level. Superregional bank Comerica (CMA), which also reported better-than-expected earnings early Tuesday, tumbled 6.5% as it tested its 50-day line.Analysts have said the sector could fall more amid uncertainty over how new policy details shake out. The dollar has strengthened on expectations that a stronger economy could lead to higher interest rates, which help banks' finances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are likely to close more branches as they try to cut costs and as more people manage their finances over their phones. Other forms of technology, like blockchain, could help the industry save billions.Morgan Stanley's Q4 earnings per share surged 88% to 81 cents, above estimates for 65 cents, while revenue rose 15% to $9.02 billion, beating forecasts for $8.47 billion.Revenue for the bank's institutional securities segment rose 35%, helped by strength in trading and M&A. Sales in the bank's important wealth management division rose 6%.However, equity underwriting revenue fell 36%, and compensation expenses rose 10%.""We reported solid results in Sales & Trading and Advisory, and record revenues in Wealth Management, while managing expenses prudently,"" CEO James Gorman said in the company's earnings release.

287,WFC,"You know the old saying about being in the right place at the right time. Better yet, rather than leaving it to chance, managers of AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX) have aimed for an added boost by putting themselves in that right place. Within their overall investment approach, they've pivoted toward stocks they think will benefit from the Trump presidency and the new Congress.Their reaction already seems to be paying off. The $876 million fund's 3.94% gain over the past month going into Thursday topped 71% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a big jump up in relative performance over the past 12 months, when the fund's 16.36% gain beat just 30% of its peer group.Since the elections, the fund has boosted its overweight in financials and added to its stake in industrials, says lead manager Karen Hiatt. Also, it has shifted to an underweight in consumer staples. In addition, anticipating an uptick in inflation, the fund is shifting toward the smaller end of large-cap stocks. ""Smaller caps typically outperform in a higher inflation environment,"" Hiatt said.Financials such as banks — especially midsize regional banks — should benefit from rising rates and from a leveling or reduction in their regulatory burden, Hiatt says. The fund's bets in that space include IBD 50 stock First Republic Bank (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY).""First Republic and Signature are the same themes,"" Hiatt said. ""First Republic is a really high-quality regional bank. They service high net worth individuals, with a lot of exposure in big cities like New York and the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles.""Shares closed Wednesday above 95. ""We initiated our position at 68 in May,"" Hiatt said. ""We sold out of Wells Fargo (WFC), into First Republic. We sold out of a bank with issues concerning lending, and bought into a bank known for quality lending, being very conservative, having high client retention and high loan growth.""Wells Fargo said this month that new credit card applications had plunged 43% and new checking accounts were down 40% in the fourth quarter vs. a year earlier, in the wake of last year's bad publicity concerning the bank's creation of fake customer accounts.Regional banks are already getting a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations.""There's been a political push to move that threshold up to $250 billion,"" Hiatt said. ""There's a good shot at getting that, which would help midsize regional banks. The lower threshold is costly, pulling down the ability of smaller banks to grow.""The fund's other holdings also illustrate a best-ideas approach by Hiatt and co-manager Raphael Edelman, since the fund runs a concentrated portfolio. ""We try to keep it below 45 stocks,"" Hiatt said. ""Now it's 40.""The managers look for innovative companies, and they find many in the technology sector. Broadcom (AVGO) is one. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and other applications.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Leaderboard points out that Broadcom's stock has rallied for two weeks. Trading around 202 as of Thursday morning, shares were extended from a 178.12 buy point. The stock's relative strength line has climbed a lot this month, which means Broadcom is outperforming the S&P 500.As IBD recently reported, at least six investment banks recently increased their price targets for the stock. One key reason is Broadcom's three quarters in a row of accelerating earnings growth, thanks largely to gains stem from Broadcom's merger with Avago.Hiatt and Edelman also like Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). ""There is a continued move of advertising dollars from traditional media to digital,"" Hiatt said. ""Google (Alphabet) is underappreciated in what it can do in YouTube, for example. And if Facebook can actually measure the returns that advertisers get on their dollars, that greater visibility of dollar-returns will continue to fuel a shift by advertisers to Facebook.""Mobileye (MBLY) is another innovator. The company develops and supplies technology that interprets what an in-car camera ""sees"" to anticipate and avoid collisions. Its products enhance vehicle safety. The company does not need the advent of fully self-driving cars. On average now, cars use about $200 each in safety equipment. ""That content is rising,"" Hiatt said. ""That's a big driver for Mobileye.""The fund is skeptical about the appeal of most health care stocks. The repeal or rollback of ObamaCare undermines the earnings growth potential of many stocks. So does potential regulatory intervention spawned by drug-pricing controversies. But Hiatt is guardedly comfortable with the fund's Celgene (CELG) holding.""As long as (drug) pricing is a concern, it's hard to see multiple expansion in many health care companies,"" she said. ""But you don't have to see multiple expansion for Celgene to work. It already trades at a (2017 projected consensus) multiple of 15 for 20% annual growth (over the next two to three years). It looks intriguing."" RELATED:Leading Stocks That Are Driving A Hot Mutual Fund's RallyFacebook, Edwards: How AllianzGI Fund Copes With Stingy MarketWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

288,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said on Wednesday that it will provide custody and fund services for more than $1 trillion in client assets from asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), a deal the bank described as one of the largest of its kind.BlackRock will be moving those services to JPMorgan from State Street (STT) in attempt to cut clients' costs, according to Bloomberg.JPMorgan said it would likely onboard those assets over the next two years. The bank's custody services include settling and holding onto clients' securities for safety purposes. It also provides accounting services and administration for funds.The deal with BlackRock comes after more recent investments in its custody banking business. JPMorgan said business done with its custody clients had grown by 10% over the past 12 months.JPMorgan shares gained 1.55% to 86.03 in the stock market today, continuing a rebound off its 50-day line as the broader market and bond yields rally.State Street, which also reported weaker-than-expected earnings Wednesday, fell 3.4% to 77.80, below its 50-day line. State Street sank as low as 74.45 intraday.BlackRock rose 1.8%, accelerating off support found in recent days at its own 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: BlackRock's deal with JPMorgan comes as many financial institutions seek to cut costs, often turning to technology to do so. Blockchain, one such technology, could save banks billions in the years to come. Bank stocks have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the so-called Trump rally, on hopes the new president and a GOP-controlled Congress would scale back regulations and grow the economy faster, leading to higher interest rates.Bank shares overall, however, have eased from their postelection run amid uncertainty of how any new policies might play out as they make their way through Congress. But, like JPMorgan, other banking giants shined Wednesday.Bank of America (BAC) shares rose 2% intraday, Citigroup (C) added 1.9%, and Wells Fargo (WFC) climbed 3.9%. Investment banking giants Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) edged up 1.4% and 2.6% respectively.RELATED:JPMorgan Cautious On Benefits From Tax Cuts, Fewer RegulationsWells Fargo To More Than Double Branch Closures In 2017; More In 2018

289,WFC,"The flagship exchange traded fund tracking the S&P 500 financial sector wobbled on Thursday as reports from banking giants kicked off the first-quarter earnings season in earnest.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) dropped 0.8% after the opening bell despite upbeat reports from Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but quickly clawed back losses. Shares of both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase advanced in early trading, while Wells Fargo (WFC) fell more than 2% on mixed results.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the U.S. stock market, edged up 0.2%.The financial sector, one of the strongest ""Trump Trades"" immediately after the November election, has wilted this year. Uncertainty about Trump's pro-business plans, including the rollback of the Dodd-Frank Act, has weighed on the sector's fortunes, along with the Fed's cautious stance about future rate hikes.Year to date through Wednesday, XLF is up 0.1% vs. a 5.2% advance for SPY.But two relatively small financial sector ETFs stand tall in 2017, defying the sector's woes.The $278 million PowerShares KBW High Dividend Yield Financial Portfolio (KBWD) and $174 million VanEck Vectors BDC Income (BIZD) have jumped more than 7% apiece year to date — the only exchange traded funds in the segment that are outpacing the S&P 500.A clue to their success lies in their names.""We've seen flat-to-lower 10-year yields along with narrow-to-contained credit spreads, which have both helped drive the performance of KBWD,"" Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares, told IBD in an email.KWBD ETF has an 8.36% 12-month yield and BIZD 7.97%. By comparison, XLF yields 1.62% and SPY 1.92%.Both KBWD and BIZD were lower in morning trade on the stock market today.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow industrials 0.5%. The Russell 2000 continued to lag, falling 0.6%, as resistance at the 50-day has been insurmountable in recent sessions. The small-cap index had been a strong performer at the end of 2016, but has been lagging the S&P 500 ever since.Among the Dow industrials, Visa (V) and Disney (DIS) paced the advancers in the stock market today, gaining 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. An RBC analyst speculated that an Apple (AAPL) acquisition of Disney would offer ""almost limitless opportunities in content and technology."" Apple shares were flat. Disney reached a new 52-week high, cooling to a 0.3% gain. Shares remain within buy range from a 112.09 flat-base entry.JPMorgan (JPM) topped on both earnings and sales estimates, fueled an initial rally, but the stock fell 0.8% by the afternoon. Fellow global investment banks Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported earnings, with mixed results. Citigroup exceeded earnings and sales estimates, while Wells Fargo beat on profit but fell short on revenue.

Earnings rose 1%, slightly better than forecast, but revenue slipped 0.9%, more than expected. The bank reported lower income from trading assets, higher deposit and long-term balances and a 39% decrease in home loan originations vs. the fourth quarter.

297,WFC,"For bank stocks during the fourth quarter, there was ""before Trump"" and ""after Trump.""But as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) lead the big banks into earnings season on Friday, Wall Street seems likely to turn its attention quickly to the latter, and how banks think they'll fare as a new, regulation-averse administration takes office.Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup (C), which reports on Jan. 18, have all said they expect gains in trading revenue during the quarter as investors uprooted their market expectations following Donald Trump's surprise election victory. The Fed's rate hike in December is unlikely to do much for net interest margins, but higher yields on the 10-year Treasury, which underpins rates on some student loans and many mortgages, could help. So could solid — but maybe not great — loan growth.""But it's really all about the forward outlook: Many banks will announce their 2017 guidance at earnings,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a research note last week. ""Better GDP outlook and higher rates, coupled with laser-focused expense management, should drive a positive forward look, supporting bank valuations through earnings.""Bank stocks were already on the rise before Trump's election on hopes for Fed rate hikes and signs in Q3 that some were returning to growth. Then they soared after Election Day  in anticipation of tax cuts, a lighter regulatory touch and infrastructure stimulus that boost economic growth. Wall Street will largely focus on banks' commentary on those measures and how higher rates will affect the bottom line and mortgage demand.""Bank stocks, financials, have generally had a great couple of months,"" David Hilder, director, capital markets at Drexel Hamilton, told IBD. ""But that's more about things that are expected to happen in the future.""Meanwhile, after soaring above 2.6% in mid-December, the 10-year Treasury yield has retreated to 2.35% on Thursday, testing its 50-day moving average intraday. Bank stocks have held up well, moving sideways in the last several weeks. If the 10-year yield can find support at the 50-day and rebound, bank stocks could see further gains. But if yields break that key line, shares of financials may struggle to hold up.Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.43, up 8%, with revenue ticking up to $23.928 billion.The biggest U.S. lender by assets and market cap has had strong loan growth in recent quarters, so expectations might be higher for them than others, Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told IBD.Commentary surrounding the company's expenses — as with other banks — could also drive the stock, Morgan Stanley said, describing the company as ""focused on driving positive operating leverage, particularly through cost saves in its consumer and (investment banking) division.""IBD'S TAKE: As interest rates rise, bank stocks are among the few market sectors that will actually benefit.Estimates: A 31% EPS jump to 38 cents on revenue of $20.89 billion, a 7% increase.Bank of America is more interest-rate sensitive than some of its rivals, largely because so much of its business is concentrated in the U.S. With the Fed in December signaling more rate hikes this year than it had in September, conversation during the earnings call could center around how a higher-rate environment would affect its outlook this year.Estimates: EPS of $1.00, down 3%, with revenue up 4% to $22.451 billion.Things to watch for: Even as Wells Fargo benefits from the same things that have helped the other big banks, the company's attempts to recover from a sham account scandal, revamp its sales incentives, and resubmitting its living will — the plan describing how a bank will end its operations if things come to that — will likely drive shares, Morgan Stanley said.New account openings plunged after news broke in September that Wells Fargo staff were accused of creating as many as 2 million fake accounts in consumers' names in attempt to hit sales goals in a high-pressure sales environment. Activity in existing accounts hasn't really changed, Stemm said.""If you're already a Wells customer, and have a lot of relationships with the bank, it's a big hassle to move, and you're probably not going to do it,"" Stemm said. ""But if you're brand-new, and you have the option to walk into the Wells door or walk into bank XYZ next door, it makes a lot of sense that perhaps some customers are choosing to go with someone else.""Wells Fargo, the top private mortgage lender, also faces rising mortgage rates, which could drive a near-term rush to buy homes before they go up any further but may weigh on demand long term.JPMorgan shares fell 1% on the stock market today, as bond yields and broader stock averages retreated. Bank of America lost 0.65%, and Wells Fargo 0.55%. Citigroup fell 1.2%. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which report next week, closed down 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively.Banks' gains come amid questions about how much higher interest rates and a steepening yield curve have been already priced into the market. Hilder added that bank stocks might still have room above them, but that some on Wall Street might be overestimating the extent to which a GOP Congress would be able to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.""Post earnings, there could be some pullback as details on tax reforms and infrastructure spend are flushed out, but we see this as a buying opportunity,"" Grasek added in the note. ""All-in, lower taxes and less regulation should set the stage for our bull case.""RELATED:Wells Fargo Backs Dividend Amid Scandal; JPMorgan, Citigroup TopU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-Mart

298,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) said on Friday that it expects to close 200 bank branches this year, more than doubling the 84 closures in 2016, with even more more than that next year, amid online shifts and fallout from its fake-account scandal.The lender, whose branch system is bigger than any other U.S. bank's, said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that those closures came amid a growing consumer preference for doing banking online and over their smartphones.Analysts in recent months have also indicated that Wells Fargo could close more branches in an attempt to shore up profits and control expenses following the fake-account scandal that has battered its reputation, prompted the ouster of its CEO, and threatens to raise legal costs.Wells Fargo was hit with a $185 million fine last year after authorities alleged bank employees created up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts in attempt to meet hyper-ambitious sales goals.""Whether Wells Fargo realizes it or not, they're going to be closing 1,000 branches,"" CLSA analyst Mike Mayo told CNN in a story published in October. ""It's a matter of when, not if.""During that month, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck also pointed to Wells' branch system as a source of potential savings.""Mary in particular has the opportunity to reaccelerate earnings growth in the consumer business by driving more efficiencies,"" Graseck wrote in an October research note, referring to Mary Mack, Wells' head of community banking. ""How? WFC has lots of room to cut costs with 1) the largest branch network in the US (6000+) and 2) becoming more digital.""In response to a question about whether to company could be more aggressive with those closures, Wells Fargo management said Friday the branch-closure plan was due consumers' ""habits and how they want to interact with us.""The plans for the closures could change with consumer demand, Wells said.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are among the few stocks in the S&P 500 to benefit from the Federal Reserve's signaling that a more aggressive approach to raising rates could come this year.Since the scandal emerged, Wells has announced pay increases for low-paid staff and overhauled its compensation program for bank-branch sales reps to eliminate product sales goals and focus more on team efforts and customer service.The company said Friday that it was too early to tell how the scandal has ultimately affected profits derived from its primary customers. New account openings and credit card applications have plunged since news of the bank's sales practices surfaced.An outside review of the bank's sales practices could take up much of the year, management said on the call.Shares were up 1.5% to 55.31 on the stock market today.

But those trends appeared unlikely to change the company's approach to investing, hiring or attempting to gain market share.""We're not going to change our plans very much, because we don't really react that much to the weather,"" Dimon said.RELATED:As The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The WayU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

305,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) failed for the second time this year to persuade U.S. regulators that it could unwind its business in the event of a failure without wreaking havoc on the broader financial system.The rejection marks another setback for the lender still reeling from a scandal over phony customer accounts and means it's now banned from buying non-bank companies or setting up international units. While deeming Wells Fargo's so-called living will inadequate, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also said Tuesday that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) had fixed deficiencies with their plans. The agencies had rejected all those banks' documents in April.Wells Fargo gets another shot at repairing its problems, the regulators said. But if it fails to do so by March 31, assets in its broker-dealer and non-bank units will be capped. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the lender will have another two years to convince the agencies it's on the right track before the regulators can step in and force it to break off pieces of its business.The San Francisco-based lender becomes the first institution to trigger the opening part of one of the most potent powers regulators were granted in Dodd-Frank: authorities that could eventually force a bank to restructure. The rejection adds to a difficult year for an embattled Wells Fargo, still trying to remedy a scandal over its employees setting up as many as 2 million accounts without customers' approval. The bank already faced restrictions on acquisitions as part of that settlement with regulators.Wells Fargo shares have climbed 2.7% this year, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. Shares fell about 1% in late trading on the stock market today after closing up 0.1% at 55.84.When its living will was first rejected earlier this year, Wells Fargo was hammered for ""material errors."" In a plan re-filed on Oct. 1, the bank detailed what it had done to fix its deficiencies. The publicly available section of the revised plan said it sold some non-core businesses to make the bank easier to handle in a failure. The lender also said it increased capital and liquid assets to be better able to absorb losses.In Tuesday's second failure, the bank didn't remedy problems with how it has organized its various ""legal entities"" and how it shares its services among units, according to the Fed and FDIC.The living-wills exercise was a key element of Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul prompted by the 2008 financial crisis. The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. that year showed what could happen when huge, complex financial firms go through a chaotic bankruptcy. The resolution plan process was meant to ensure big banks can be taken down quickly without threatening the economy. Large U.S. banks must persuade at least one of the banking agencies that their living wills are viable, and the industry has faced numerous setbacks in its submissions.The battle over the massive resolution plans has raged for years between regulators and the nation's biggest banks. It came to a head in April, when the five lenders were sent back to the drawing board. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley were both faulted by only one of the agencies nine months ago, while Citigroup Inc. got through largely unscathed.As the other big banks prepare for their next living-will deadline on July 1, the four cleared Tuesday by regulators can breathe a sigh of relief that they ""adequately remediated deficiencies.""

306,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other top banks picked up steam Wednesday immediately after Federal Reserve policymakers upped their forecast for interest-rate hikes that could take place next year, but then gave up some gains or reversed lower.The Fed on Wednesday said it expects three rate hikes next year, up from the two it forecast in September. The central bank also raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 0.5%-0.75%, from 0.25%-0.5%, as was expected.JPMorgan closed virtually flat, dropping 3 cents to 84.73 on the stock market today after rising as high as 86.12 soon after the fed announcement. Bank of America rose 0.3% while Citigroup (C) lost 0.6%. Wells Fargo (WFC) dropped 2%.Goldman Sachs (GS) edged up 0.6%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) added 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of fewer regulations under a Trump administration has sent bank stocks higher. Trump's announcement that he would focus on developing the nation's infrastructure has also lifted steel stocks. When the Fed increases its interest rates, banks can, in turn, raise their own rates and expand their net interest margins.Soon after the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon, banks began saying their prime lending rates are going up. But not all banks will be affected by the Fed's move in the same ways.Investment bank Goldman Sachs is seen benefiting especially from higher rates and market volatility as it relies more on fixed-income, currency and commodity trading. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods also said last month BofA's cost cuts position it better than its rivals to take advantage of higher rates.But Citigroup's exposure to overseas markets has been flagged as a concern as higher rates and the stronger dollar send investors' money to the U.S.The rate hike also boosted the 10-year Treasury yield, which also moves mortgage rates higher, and Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender by volume.RELATED:Federal Reserve Hikes Rates, Now Sees 3 Moves In 2017; Yellen On TapWhy BofA, Goldman Sachs Could Stand Out In Bank RallyBanking ETFs Emerge As Leaders After Postelection Rally

308,WFC,"The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index sold off Monday, but closed off intraday lows, as Wall Street reassessed prospects that President Trump will be able to deliver the fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.Here's the immediate problem: House Speaker Paul Ryan, Trump's legislative quarterback, has a playbook that just suffered a humiliating, one-sided defeat. Yet the only GOP tax-reform plan on the table comes straight out of Ryan's playbook and centers around a 20% border-adjusted tax on imports that appears to be almost as unpopular as RyanCare among Republicans in Congress.Until Trump replaces Ryan as the quarterback, financial markets could suffer from diminished confidence that tax cuts will be forthcoming. On Monday, the Dow was dragged down by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which finished down 0.1% and 1.3%, respectively, on the stock market today.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards: View The Winners By CategorySlower growth means less need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which likely would be a negative for net interest margins of Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFM) and other big lenders. BofA fell 0.4% and Wells Fargo 0.8% Monday, exceeding the Dow's 0.2% decline and the 0.1% S&P 500 loss.The Trump team never really got behind RyanCare and quickly pulled the plug when it appeared doomed. The one thing President Trump has proved is that he's quick to cut his losses, which also served him well in clearing out of Atlantic City before the city's casino industry cratered.While the Trump administration is more divided over a 20% tax on imports, which chief strategist Steve Bannon reportedly likes because of its nationalist overtones, expect the president to give a short shelf-life to the border tax.IBD'S TAKE:  The sudden sell-off in indexes and rout in financials marks a change in market character. Read IBD's The Big Picture every day to find out whether the market's uptrend stays intact. Visit Leaderboard to see whether the best-performing stocks are ripe for buying or profit-taking.Wall Street strategists are doubtful that the border tax, which would raise about $1 trillion over a decade to help make tax cuts deficit-neutral, will be adopted, and even more so given Ryan's inability to move his signature health plan out of the House.The question for markets is how long it will take Trump to kick Ryan's border tax to the curb and start pushing the kind of tax program that has the best, though still uncertain, chances of uniting Republicans: old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.That pivot may not happen right away, if Trump's weekend tweet blaming the House Freedom Caucus for RyanCare's failure instead signals that the president is still too consumed with finger-pointing to move on to taxes.And the conservative group may represent another obstacle as key members already have voiced their opposition to Ryan's border tax plan. While they could be potential allies on less controversial tax cuts, Trump hasn't shown he's ready to make peace.Evercore ISI senior political strategist Terry Haines has written that he expects the eventual fiscal package to raise deficits by $2 trillion over 10 years and include a corporate tax-rate cut to 20%.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring just a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than deficit neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience, and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare. It's also unclear how the Federal Reserve and financial markets would respond to a big fiscal stimulus and higher deficits. Higher borrowing costs and uncertainty over the future of tax rates also might reduce the effectiveness of tax cuts to a significant extent.RELATED:The Bull Case For Tax Cuts If ObamaCare Repeal FailsTrump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformIf Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, who heads the Tuesday Group of moderate GOP lawmakers.If ObamaCare repeal fails, some analysts were predicting a continued rough spell for financials but a potential bounce for beaten-down hospital stocks. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) all have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that President Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare.If Ryan lacks the votes and pulls the bill, ""then we think there could be renewed pressure on financial stocks as investor confidence in Congress's ability to pass President Trump's economic agenda will be further eroded,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington analyst Brian Gardner.Meanwhile, shares of hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) could see a rebound. Hospital stocks have suffered in recent weeks as Ryan and Trump pushed a plan that could reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million.IBD'S TAKE: If the GOP fails in its bid to repeal and replace ObamaCare, don't assume that it will hamper the rest of President Trump's economic agenda. Failure is likely to focus the GOP on delivering deficit-increasing tax cuts, retroactive to 2017, to avoid a shellacking in the 2018 elections. Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick expects that the GOP will somehow find a way to get the AHCA through both the House and Senate. ""If we're wrong, then on Friday we see upside to hospitals that is likely limited by overall market downside as the probability that tax reform can get done this year diminishes,"" she wrote.Actually, Tenet rose 4.1% and HCA 0.8% Thursday, in a sign investors have doubts that Ryan's bill will pass. But banks were generally higher too, though well off session highs: Bank of America rose 0.6% and Goldman Sachs 0.4%. Wells Fargo fell 0.1%.After the market close, the Congressional Budget Office released a score of the revised health care bill. The CBO still sees the legislation increasing the number of uninsured by 24 million. But it cut the bill's deficit savings by more than half to $150 billion, largely reflecting some tax and Medicaid changes.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesTrumpCare Has Momentum: These Health Stocks Are ScramblingThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

312,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS) said it's too soon to say what trading activity will be like this year after reporting much-better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on strong bond trades.CFO Harvey Schwartz told analysts that confidence is the best stimulus for client activity and that the latter half of last year saw a surge in client confidence.""With the shifting policies around the globe, it's an extraordinary catalyst for client dialogue, for decision making and for content,"" he said.As the Federal Reserve looks to increase rates three times this year, Goldman stands to gain further, with Schwartz predicting ""meaningful upside"" in fixed income, commodities and currency trading if rate continue rising.In Q4, earnings per share quadrupled to $5.08, easily beating views for $4.82, after a mortgage-securities settlement a year earlier gouged earnings. Revenue jumped 12% to $8.17 billion. Fixed income, currency, and commodities trading revenue soared 78% to $2 billion.Shares fell 0.6% to 234.29 on the stock market today. Citigroup (C), which also reported earnings and strong bond-trading revenue, fell 1.7%. Rival investment banking giant Morgan Stanley (MS), whose fourth-quarter results on Tuesday topped views, rose 1.7%.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged up 0.5%, and Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.6%. Those companies reported earnings last week, as trading revenue surged. Wells Fargo (WFC), which will accelerate its branch closures this year and next, added 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are likely to close more branches as they try to cut costs and as more people manage their finances over their phones. Other forms of technology, like blockchain, could help the industry save billions.After a steep climb following the election of Donald Trump and the prospect of looser regulations, job growth, inflation and higher interest rates, bank stocks appear to have taken a breather in recent weeks.Bank stocks seem likely to cool down further amid signs that Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress don't agree on a key piece of hoped-for tax cuts, adding doubts to a major postelection driver of bank stocks. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, as well as superregional and many other bank stocks suffered big losses on Tuesday on Trump's tax reform comments, but on Wednesday the president-elect said the issue would be ""discussed.""Longer-term bond yields, which rise on expectations of future inflation and economic growth, have also eased from postelection gains, hitting prospects for banks' interest margins. But the 10-year Treasury yield rebounded Wednesday, moving back above its 50-day line.RELATED:Citigroup Trading Revenue Climbs 31% As Profit Beats EstimatesBanks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates LoomAs The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The Way
"
313,WFC,"Citigroup (C) reported fourth-quarter profit that surpassed analysts' estimates as trading revenue jumped 31%, more than the bank had forecast last month.Net income rose 7.1% to $3.57 billion, or $1.14 a share, from $3.34 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier, the New York-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted earnings of $1.12 a share.Citigroup follows rivals JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) in posting a jump in revenue from helping clients trade in the months surrounding Donald Trump's surprise election win in November. Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat, 56, also has been restructuring the firm and whittling costs as he seeks to improve profitability and return more capital to shareholders.The bank's traders handling bonds, currencies and commodities generated $3.01 billion in the quarter, 36% more than a year earlier, excluding an accounting adjustment from that period. Their fourth-quarter revenue was the highest since before the financial crisis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and better than the $2.83 billion estimated by analysts.Revenue from equities trading, an area the bank has targeted for an additional $1 billion in annual revenue, rose 15% to $694 million. That was just short of the $708 million estimated by analysts.Combined, trading revenue rose 31% to $3.7 billion. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach had predicted Dec. 7 that it would rise about 20% in the quarter from a year earlier.Companywide revenue fell 8% to $17 billion, missing analysts' $17.3 billion estimate, as revenue tumbled 79% to $657 million in Citi Holdings, a unit housing operations and assets tagged for disposal. Operating expenses also declined 9%, to $10.1 billion, just below analysts' $10.2 billion estimate.Citi Holdings still eked out an $87 million profit. Gerspach had said last month that he was expecting a ""modest loss"" at that unit. The bank has said it will stop breaking out Citi Holdings' results in financial reports this year after its assets — $54 billion at year-end — shrank to become a relatively small part of the company's total balance sheet.U.S. bank stocks surged in the final weeks of 2016 as investors speculated that Trump's policies will lead to higher interest rates, looser regulation and lower taxes. The KBW Bank Index climbed 20% from the Nov. 8 vote through Tuesday, with Citigroup rising 17%.Trump's victory and the Federal Reserve's December interest-rate hike already have burnished Wall Street earnings by spurring clients to reposition stock and bond portfolios and react to currency swings.Trading, merger advice and securities underwriting helped boost revenue in the institutional clients group by 14% to $8.34 billion. Net income in that division, run by President Jamie Forese, rose 97% to $2.47 billion, helped in part by lower credit costs.Investment-banking revenue was unchanged at $1.13 billion, beating the $1.02 billion average estimate of analysts.Revenue from the consumer banking division, run by Stephen Bird, rose 2% to $8.03 billion. The bank has been spending money to increase revenue, committing to invest $1 billion in Mexico, and expanding the credit-card business. Last year, the bank brought Costco Wholesale (COST) customers on board in what the company has hailed as a key growth initiative.In December, the bank said one of Bird's key lieutenants, Jonathan Larsen, had resigned for personal reasons. Calling Larsen's oversight of retail banking and mortgages a ""critical role,"" the bank said in an internal memo dated Dec. 9 that it had yet to choose a replacement.Citigroup was the last of the six biggest U.S. banks to report results. Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs (GS) said fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $2.35 billion as the fixed-income business got a boost from speculation economic growth will accelerate. In previous days, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America (BAC) all said profits rose in the quarter, helped by stronger bond trading. Wells Fargo (WFC) said net income dropped 5.4% as mortgage revenue declined.RELATED:Dow Stock Goldman Sachs Crushes Earnings Estimates On Bond TradingBanks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

317,WFC,"Big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) continued their postelection stock-market surge on Thursday, amid rising odds for less regulation, higher inflation and Fed rate hikes next year.CNBC also reported that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is being considered for Treasury secretary.Shares of JPMorgan rallied 4.6% to close at 76.65 in the stock market today, setting a record high. Bank of America surged 4.4% to 18.76, blowing past buy range after breaking out Wednesday. Citigroup rose 3.9% to 53.61, reaching the highest in 11 months.Wells Fargo (WFC) leapt 7.6%, adding to Wednesday's 5.4% pop. Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 4.3% and Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 4.1%.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield added 7 basis points to 2.14% after skyrocketing Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have jumped, and the Dow has touched an all-time high following Trump's victory. So have other infrastructure-spending-friendly stocks, like construction companies. Thursday's stock gains follow a strong performance for banking on Wednesday, amid greater anticipation that President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress would work to curb industry regulations, including potentially gutting Dodd-Frank.After a wild, toxic, stressful presidential campaign in which the big banks were often a punching bag, analysts have also said Trump's more cordial, evenhanded victory speech — and its focus on a massive infrastructure overhaul — helped lift markets Wednesday after being pressured in the run-up to Election Day.Analysts have said Trump's focus on tax cuts and public infrastructure spending could bring higher inflation on a flood of new debt coming to the market and higher bond yields.The rising inflation, along with the current market rally, have also helped shore up the odds that the Federal Reserve might raise the benchmark interest rate, potentially boosting banks' net-interest margins.Trump's election, however, doesn't come without risks to the banking sector, analysts note.""The opportunities come primarily from a steepening yield curve, increased volatility and reduced regulation,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note. ""The risks come from a retrenchment of the U.S. from the global economy and trade agreements.""In a separate note, KBW said it was ""more cautious"" on Citigroup, given the company's exposure to Mexico, a country that could be among the most vulnerable if Trump shreds existing U.S. trade pacts.Citigroup in September said it saw ""tremendous untapped potential"" in Mexico.RELATED:Wells Fargo Backs Dividend Amid Scandal; JPMorgan, Citigroup TopBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain EmbraceJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo Earnings Top
"
318,WFC,"There's a decent case to be made that investors' fear of Donald Trump winning the White House may turn out to be a good deal worse than the reality, at least in the intermediate term.Stock indexes crashed 5% overnight with odds for a December Federal Reserve hike tumbling. But after an initial modest sell-off at the open, the major averages have reversed for solid gains, with soaring bond yields.The overnight reaction to Trump looked like it may vindicate economists who predicted the market would fall up to 12% if Trump won. But once you consider Trump's near-term priorities and the challenges of working with Congress — even a GOP Congress restrained by a filibuster in the Senate — the agenda looks more market friendly than unfriendly.Priority one for Trump on the domestic front is likely to be revving up growth via infrastructure spending, cutting the corporate tax rate and offering multinationals the chance to repatriate overseas profits at a lower tax rate.He's talked about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, double what Hillary Clinton proposed to spend, with both candidates talking up the potential of public-private partnerships.""With the focus on infrastructure, the basic resources sector is one of the best performers today,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research in London.Both Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged on the stock market today, suring 12% and 9%, respectively. Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) initially spiked as Trump's victory fueled a safe-haven bid with the dollar plunging. But as stocks and the dollar rebound, gold erased its big gains and Newmont traded 2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Gold prices are rising sharply Wednesday. That will give a big boost to Newmont and other gold mining stocks, which are technical turning points.Biotech and drug stocks such as Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton will not be president and the Senate will remain in GOP hands. Clinton had vowed to crack on ""excessive"" price increases, notably on older treatments. She also likely would have pushed for the government to negotiate drug prices lower.Trump's victory means that regulatory relief for super-regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations may go a step further than expected, paving the way for a round of acquisitions. It also may ease pressures on too-big-to-fail banks, which explains why Wells Fargo (WFC) popped 6% intraday, recovering from an overnight sell-off. Wells Fargo also may see less political pressure over its fradualent account scandal.""We expect a positive snapback move once investors digest the results and factor in a more favorable regulatory environment for the financial sector,"" wrote Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Banks have been rising in part due to expectations for a Fed hike amid stronger wage growth and tighter labor markets. While the Fed may decide to pause before hiking if Trump's election does send financial shock waves around the globe, that's far from clear.""Expect an immediate market pullback, on fear, and then a pause,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Should Mr. Trump be able to reduce the uncertainty around what policies he intends to pursue, it is quite possible markets will recover as the economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain sound.""Trump is likely to kill President Obama's overtime rule that's due to take effect in December that guarantees time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — about twice the current level. Wal-Mart (WMT) already raised pay for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime, but many employers have been slower to adopt the change as Congress aims to delay it. Some, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, have said they'll effectively demote their managers and make them punch the clock.The ObamaCare employer mandate is likely history, meaning modest-wage employers would no longer be fined if they fail to offer health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. Along with retailers, Trump may bring relief to restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) that are being squeezed by competition and compensation hikes, contributing to a record gap between the cost of fast food and eating in.What are markets scared about? Trump's threats to impose tariffs on companies like Ford Motor (F) that send cars to the U.S. from Mexico, to walk away from Nafta and to crack down on unauthorized immigrants are why economists have said his agenda could hurt the economy.If Trump were to start his presidency by labeling China a currency manipulator and imposing tariffs, that could start a trade war, with China reciprocating by targeting the sales of Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Microsoft (MSFT). China, facing slower growth and an unsustainable build up in debt, could easily spark another bout of financial market turmoil as was seen this past January.How Trump proceeds on trade will be one of his most important early decisions. The good news is that Trump isn't campaigning anymore — and his was an especially insular campaign. Surrounded by pro-growth economic advisors and now in direct contact with top business leaders, Trump is likely to act deliberately, not rashly. That may mean opening up talks with both countries about how to move trade relations forward and setting out intermediate term goals to measure progress.This seems consistent with Trump's victory speech words: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Trump seems unlikely to back down from his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but that, in and of itself, would have more of a symbolic than an economic effect. His rhetoric has shifted to cracking down on unauthorized immigrants who are violent criminals, and there may be fewer of those than he implies.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseTrump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks SoarAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch ClockFBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump Wins

But with one day to go, Donald Trump extended his lead over Clinton, 43% to 41%, according to the latest IBD/TIPP presidential tracking poll. Gold and silver prices slumped as investors showed higher appetite for risk Monday.On Sunday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reiterated its earlier stance that no criminal charges are contemplated against Clinton over the use of a private email server for government work.A little over a week ago, a new FBI probe of Clinton emails triggered sharp uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. election and burnished gold's safe-haven appeal.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) dropped 1.8% Monday, following its 2.3% gain last week.

322,WFC,"Lower Treasury yields Friday pressured most financials, including Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS) and American Express (AXP).But Visa (V), the second-best performer on the Dow industrials this year, rose to a fresh all-time high Friday. Its archrival Mastercard (MA) also reached record levels and its stock is still within buy range.The 10-year yield fell below 2.5% intraday, resuming their retreat following the Fed's rate hike on Wednesday, as policymakers did not signal faster tightening ahead.Rates on mortgages and the value of other types of credit are tied in with those yields. The yields also serve as a window into investors' expectations for higher prices in the future — potentially prompting the Fed to raise the benchmark interest rate, which, in turn, can help banks' finances as banks hike their own interest rates and other costs to compensate.Visa rose 0.2% to 90.21 in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high of 90.63  intraday. The stock has been tailing upward since the beginning of the year, logging a 16% gain since Dec. 30.Mastercard climbed 0.1% to 112.83, wthin range of a 109.03 buy point of a flat base initially cleared in mid-January. Mastercard sold off at the end of the month, closing below its 50-day line on Feb. 1. But the stock rebounded, retaking its still-value 109.03 buy point and marching on to new highs.Visa has been gaining on a variety of factors. Among them: stronger consumer optimism, the acquisition of Visa Europe, and the potential in cross-border and electronic payments.Visa and Mastercard, while known for their credit cards, are not technically card issuers. They make money on transaction fees, and aren't directly affected by interest rate shifts. Issuing banks, such as JPMorgan Chase,  Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), actually carry the balances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks and financials have been among the biggest Trump plays this year, on hopes for a combination of fewer regulations and higher interest rates. Steel stocks, potential beneficiaries of Trump's plans for a massive infrastructure investment, are among the others. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.05%, Bank of America 1.4%, Citigroup 1.3% and Wells Fargo 1.1%.Goldman Sachs and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, both closing just above their 50-day lines.The Dow's American Express, which does issue cards directly and carry the balances, trickled 0.65% lower. Capital One (COF), which also issues cards, fell 2.2%, undercutting its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This YearDow Stock American Express Ups Ante In High-Fee, High-End Card Race

323,WFC,"Stocks opened higher Friday, following a disappointing read on December retail sales and mixed bank earnings.The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 climbed 0.3% as the Nasdaq added 0.4%.The Nasdaq starts Friday's session up 0.5% for the week after Thursday marked the first down session of the new year. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 are down 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively, after a tough week of Senate confirmation hearings, the first press conference by President-elect Donald Trump and commentary from Federal Reserve officials, as well as the first weakening in oil prices in a month.Reports from big banks set the fourth-quarter earnings season in serious motion early Friday.Bank of America (BAC) traded 1% higher at the open after delivering mixed fourth-quarter results. Earnings narrowly beat views and revenue stopped short of the consensus target. The company noted that the rise in interest rates occurred too late to affect fourth-quarter results, but would lead to increased interest income in the first quarter. Bank of America shares are in the fifth week of a flat consolidation.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also reported better-than-expected earnings but revenue just missed views. Wells Fargo (WFC) fell short on the top and bottom lines. JPMorgan and Wells gained 1%.PNC Financial Services (PNC) added 1.3%, as earnings easily cleared analysts' fourth-quarter targets. Revenue just met expectations and the company trimmed its loan loss provision to $67 million, down $20 million, as overall credit quality held steady. PNC has been rattling off new highs, ending Thursday up 35% since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in September.Monster Beverage (MNST) jumped 4% at the open. Monster climbed back above the 50-day moving average. It slide below the line earlier in the week, after Nielsen data showed the company's sales slipped last month as it used promotions to attempt to revive weakened demand.Crude oil slipped  a half percent, sending West Texas Intermediate below $53 a barrel, down a bit less than 3% for the week. Gold added 0.3% to go above $1,196 an ounce. The dollar reversed early losses and gained ground. Bonds also reversed, raising the 10-year yield 3 basis points to 2.39%.Prices paid by producers in December rose 0.3%, the Labor Department said, a slight downtick from November's 0.4% gain and in line with expectations.

"
324,WFC,"In a post-financial crisis world, the mortgage industry is facing increased regulation, and that's a good thing for Ellie Mae (ELLI).The cloud-based software provider's role has been to make life easier for mortgage professionals by helping them automate what has largely been a paper-based business, analysts say. Higher government scrutiny is making automation of the industry more necessary than ever.So Ellie Mae -- not to be confused with mortgage agency Fannie Mae -- services U.S. lenders and mortgage originators, primarily through its flagship software, Encompass. The program facilitates a large chunk of the process, from the time a homebuyer walks into a bank looking for a mortgage to the closing of the sale, explains Barclays analyst Saket Kalia.""Everything that's being done in the background, whether it's underwriting and going through the mortgage (application) and getting a home inspection or flood certificate -- all of the system flows behind that -- their current Encompass platform can really handle from end to end,"" he said.Kalia said that Ellie Mae's platform easily makes up more than 80% of the company's total revenue. Ellie Mae estimates about a quarter of all residential mortgages are made through Encompass. And there's room to grow.That was evident in the company's earnings report, released late Thursday. The number of active users of Encompass grew 18% from the prior-year quarter to 159,523, with revenue per average active user rising 23% to $640.There was more positive news in the fundamentals. Ellie Mae said profit growth was 60% to 72 cents a share on 46% revenue growth to $100.4 million, solidly above estimates for 59 cents earnings a share and $92.2 million in sales.The company forecast 2016 revenue to fall within a range of $351 million to $353 million, up from a prior sales outlook for $338 million to $341 million. Adjusted net income is now expected to hit $2.17-$2.18 per share, up from previous targets of $2-$2.06 a share for the year.Shares had fallen more than 4% prior to the earnings report on Thursday. The stock, however, roared back to a new high on Friday, leaping nearly 10% to close at 107.15. On Monday, Ellie Mae finished the day down 1.2% to 105.89.Analysts say there's more business potential out there for Ellie Mae, if it can snare it.""The mortgage market was and still is inefficient,"" said William Blair analyst Brandon Dobell, who has a market perform rating on Ellie Mae stock. ""(If you've) ever gone through buying a home and (refinancing) a home, it takes a lot longer than it should.""The changes that came in the wake of the housing crash accelerated the adoption of technology in a fragmented industry typically flooded with paperwork.The mortgage origination process is still nowhere near being entirely electronic, said Dobell, but Ellie Mae has ""really taken the guesswork out of what form to use when, what does this rule mean, did I forget a form,"" he said.Analysts point to Canadian-based D+H as being a roughly equal competitor. Privately held Calyx and Black Knight Financial Services (BKFS) also are mentioned, but Ellie Mae is ""far and away the most dominant in (its) space,"" said Kalia.IBD'S TAKE: Ellie Mae shares broke out of a flat base in late September, but have dodged back in and out of that base since then, highlighted by Thursday's 4% loss. Its earnings report, issued after the close Thursday, could well set shares off on another growth spurt.And much of Ellie Mae's growth can be attributed to the compliance and regulatory changes that those outside the circle of ""mega-lenders"" have had to grapple with in recent years.Big banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and others are likely to have their own in-house mortgage-origination software. But smaller lenders have come to rely on Ellie Mae's cloud-based system to incorporate the appropriate changes by deadline, a process that can be expensive and cumbersome to do on their own.""Once Dodd-Frank came out, some of these smaller banks really had trouble maintaining anything that they'd written in house,"" said Kalia. ""One thing that Ellie Mae excels at is really building in the latest compliance requirements into their software.""It's been a positive for Ellie Mae's market share that there are far more small players on the market these days.In the years since the financial crisis, big banks have gone from making up 70% of the mortgage business to about 10% to 20%, according to Dobell. Conversely, small lenders have climbed from 10% to 15% of the market to a share of ""probably close to 60%.""""There's a been a huge, huge, huge shift in favor of the types of customers who would use Ellie Mae or a D+H product,"" he said. ""These are the independent mortgage companies -- they are nonbank lenders like a Guaranteed Rate or a Ditech, (a) local credit union (or) a regional bank.""He went on to say: ""The bigger banks have really gotten out of the mortgage (business) except for small parts of it.""Plus, a healthy mortgage environment has been helpful.""This has really been the perfect trifecta for Ellie Mae over the last few years,"" said Kalia, pointing to the ""rising tide in mortgages,"" Ellie Mae's customers processing more loans, and the company's growing market share.""It's actually been a great time for Ellie Mae, with those trends,"" Kalia said.An expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December, however, will in all likelihood decrease the number of refinances that occur. And Ellie Mae would ""absolutely feel an impact,"" he said.But Kalia added that management, which has alluded to refis accounting for about 40% of the overall business and purchase volume making up the rest, has been fairly conservative in its expectations, factoring a rate hike into the equation.William Blair's Dobell says the challenges that Ellie Mae faces now are that of a growth company, with difficult year-over-year user-count comparisons coming up.

325,WFC,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Wednesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. Markets rallied Monday as Hillary Clinton's odds improved, but as the ""Brexit"" vote showed, you still have to wait for the final tally. Watch for stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Caterpillar (CAT), General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Exxon Mobil (XOM)…
"
326,WFC,"U.S. stocks inched up in early trade Monday morning as the market tried to end four losing sessions in a row.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each added 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and the small cap Russell 2000 were flat. Volume in the stock market today was running below average on both major exchanges. Volume was above average Thursday and Friday on the Nasdaq. The above-average volume coincided with the Nasdaq's moves below its 50-day moving average line, not a good sign.Chevron (CVX) bounced 1.4% higher early Monday, adding to Friday's 4% pop on an 84% earnings beat for the third quarter. Chevron rose despite a 1.5% drop in the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil.Banks continued to show strength. Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) all were up in early action.In economic news, consumer spending for September matched expectations with a 0.5% increase. But personal income grew at 0.3%, falling shy of views for 0.4%, according to Econoday.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for October checked in at 50.6 — a bad miss for the business barometer, which failed to match even the lowest estimate in the range. The Street expected 54.3, and the lowest estimate in the range was 53.1. The 50.6 reading was a five-month low for the manufacturing gauge.
"
327,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings Monday morning on fixed-income trading activity and cost curbs. That followed solid results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks on Friday.Bank of America earned 41 cents a share in the third quarter, up from 37 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected a decline to 34 cents. Revenue was $21.635 billion vs. views for $20.965 billion.""We delivered strong results this quarter by staying true to our strategy of responsible growth and focusing on the quality of the relationships with our customers and clients,"" said CEO Brian Moynihan in a statement.Q3 was a return to growth for BofA, after earnings and revenue fell vs. a year earlier in both Q1 and Q2.Loans rose 3% vs. a year earlier.Adjusted trading revenue climbed 18%, with fixed-income trading up 39%, offsetting a 17% drop in equity-trading revenue. Investment banking revenue climbed 13%.Expenses fell 3.3% as BofA cut 6,000 jobs and closed 100 branches over the past year. Moynihan has targeted further cuts as other banks try to curb costs in a slow-growth environment.Bank of America said on its post-earnings conference call with analysts that it hasn't found any problems with its sales practices in the wake of the Wells Fargo (WFC) cross-selling scandal, in which millions of customer accounts were created without authorization. JPMorgan Chase said Friday that it found isolated issues, but nothing systemic.BofA shares closed up 0.3% at 16.05 in the stock market today. Shares hit a nine-month high on Oct. 10, briefly topping a key resistance level of 16.34.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks have rallied in recent weeks on growing expectations of Federal Reserve rate hike this year. Here's why investors are finally getting with the Fed's program.On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo reported earnings above Wall Street estimates, with JPMorgan and Citigroup also reporting booming fixed-income trading revenue. But earnings did fall modestly vs. a year earlier for all three banks. All three stocks initially rose Friday but closed with tiny losses.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo shares dipped 0.5% Monday, while Citigroup finished virtually flat.RELATED:Wells Fargo Backs Dividend Amid Scandal; JPMorgan, Citigroup Top
"
328,WFC,"What if the scandal now plaguing Wells Fargo (WFC) wasn't confined only to Wells Fargo?Think about it: After the 2008-09 financial meltdown, fed funds rates plunged from above 5% to near zero. That's a lot of revenue gone. For bankers, that has changed their culture considerably, says Paul Noring, a managing director specializing in financial services for the consultant firm Navigant.Noring points out there's an adage that bankers used to ""lend at 6%, borrow at 3% and be on the golf course at 3."" That hasn't been true since at least 2009, and banks have had to adjust. It's possible that other banks may have dabbled in some of the same practices as Wells, he says.""The drivers are that we've been in this protracted low-interest-rate environment,"" Noring said. ""In cutting costs, you move your employees more to incentive-based operations.""""I would not be surprised if there were other institutions with similar issues,"" he said.Wells Fargo has been under the gun since Sept. 8, when the banking giant fired 5,300 employees for creating phony accounts in order to boost sales figures and jack up bonus compensation. The bank agreed to pay $185 million in fines and will refund $5 million to customers. Wells Chief Executive John G. Stumpf has been excoriated in Congressional hearings of late over the scandal.Shares have tumbled from a high of 51 reached at the beginning of September. Shares ended trading Monday down another 1% to 43.83, their lowest level since December 2013.The reason: Customers may have been dinged for small maintenance fees on those ghost accounts without their knowledge. More importantly, maintaining those accounts -- ranging from charge cards to home equity loans -- would have shown up on their credit reports and could adversely affect them if too many outstanding accounts show up.Ultimately, that means higher interest rates for loans, Noring says. That's good for banks, not so good for consumers.So what to do? First off, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which prosecuted and fined Wells, says there are a number of warning signs consumers should watch for when opening a bank account:For those concerned about their current accounts, whether they be at Wells Fargo or elsewhere, Noring suggests several steps. First, check your credit score and what's showing up on your credit report. Any account that's unfamiliar needs to be questioned.Second, Noring says customers should make a written request to see all accounts in their name, known as a ""qualified written request."" It may take a while but banks will have to comply.Noring says the most vulnerable are the elderly and those with relatively smaller means.He adds larger banks are the most likely to commit Wells-style infractions since they're the ones with the most products to cross-sell along with checking accounts. Many have goals of getting customers to sign on for at least eight financial products. Community banks with fewer financial tools are less likely to do what Wells did.If there's one silver lining, Noring says, it's that the harm to consumers from what Wells did seems relatively minor.""It is scary in many ways, but when you look at the level of consumer harm, I don't think the numbers are massive,"" he said. ""It is going to affect the interest rate that you pay. But the question is how much and over what time.""

329,WFC,"The Nasdaq composite picked up where it left off Monday with another new high, helped by strength in select China-based growth names.The Nasdaq rose nearly 0.4%, setting intraday and record close Tuesday. The S&P was virtually flat and the Dow Jones industrial edged lower by nearly 0.2%. Small caps  outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 1%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking higher than Monday's level. Nasdaq volume was slightly lower.Dow component Apple (AAPL) added minimally to this month's gains, rising 0.1% to 119.11. Numerous published reports said the company is working on augmented reality (AR) glasses with German firm Carl Zeiss. Apple is still in buy range from a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far.JD.com (JD) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising 2.4% to 26.90, after JPMorgan upgraded the Chinese internet retailer to overweight from neutral, and raised its price target to 39 from 32. JD.com is in a consolidation with a 29.33 buy point. NetEase (NTES), meanwhile, added 2.2% to 239.88. It's working on a late-stage consolidation, but is still quite a ways below a potential entry at 272.68.IBD's airline group was on the day's top gainers, up around 3%. Allegiant Travel (ALGT) bounced off its 10-week moving average, rising 5.7%. Alaska Air (ALK) is also getting support at its 10-week line.

Goldman pared a 1.6% loss to just 0.1%.A trio of financial companies report earnings on Friday, including JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).In the stock market today, shares of Chipotle (CMG) jumped 4.9% to 414.35. The company's fourth-quarter outlook wasn't great, but investors seemed to focus instead on a 14.7% rise in December same-store sales.In the medical sector, NuVasive (NUVA) broke out of a base in active trading.

330,WFC,"Bank stocks retreated, dragging down the Dow industrials, as Treasury yields fell Thursday on ADP's employment gauge.The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps determine the rate on mortgages and other debts, was down nine basis points to 2.35%, after hitting a recent peak above 2.6% in mid-December. The two-year yield, which influences credit-card debt and other key loans, rose five basis points to 1.17%. A flatter yield curve is not good news for bank profitability.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares closed 0.9% lower on the stock market today, while Bank of America (BAC) dropped 1.2% and Citigroup (C) 1.7%. Wells Fargo (WFC) retreated 1.55%. Goldman Sachs (GS) pulled back 0.7%, and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 0.9%.JPMorgan and Goldman are part of the Dow Jones industrial average and are a key reason why the blue-chip index is lagging Thursday.ADP said the private sector added 153,000 jobs in December, below expectations, according to MarketWatch, and lower than the 215,000 added in November. The government's December jobs report is set for release on Friday.Bank stock charts generally look healthy, with share prices leveling off in recent weeks following a long run-up after the election of Donald Trump. Wall Street has been betting that a combination of tax cuts, regulatory cutbacks, an infrastructure overhaul and higher inflation under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will benefit banks in the years to come.The economic growth and infrastructure investment have led to anticipation of higher inflation, which has pushed longer-term yields up as investors try to make up for the dollar's declining buying power over time. When the Fed raises rates, a prospect more likely under higher inflation, banks can more easily raise their own, helping to pad their finances.The Federal Reserve has already offered more bullish signals on rate hikes for this year. According to minutes from the Fed's December meeting, policymakers ""indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years.""IBD'S TAKE: The Fed can raise its own benchmark interest rate in an attempt to curb inflation and economic overexpansion and make borrowing more expensive. With investors banking on Trump's fiscal policy jolting the economy, Fed policymakers may get more aggressive on raising rates. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo report quarterly earnings next week.RELATED:More Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-MartAs The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The WayU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

331,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) continued to see fewer account openings last month, as the banking giant continues to deal with questions about its sales practices following allegations this year that it opened up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts. However, the declines on a month-to-month basis have eased.Opened consumer checking accounts in November plunged 41% from a year ago, Wells Fargo said. But those openings were down only 9% from October. October new accounts tumbled 27% from September.Customer loyalty scores, meanwhile, were down from last year but ticked up a bit from October.""We know we have more work ahead of us and we remain focused on strengthening our relationships with existing customers and building new ones with potential customers,"" Mary Mack, Wells' head of community banking, said in a statement.Shares rose 0.3% to 55.34 in the stock market today. Like other banks, Wells Fargo got a postelection bump on the prospect of eased regulations, higher interest rates and a more favorable yield spread, but the stock had eased in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of fewer regulations under a Trump administration has sent bank stocks higher. Trump's announcement that he would focus on developing the nation's infrastructure has also lifted steel stocks. Wells Fargo in September settled with regulators over allegations that sales staff at its retail banking division — that is, its bank branches — for years opened accounts without consumers' knowledge or permission to hit sales goals in a high-pressure culture.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last month revoked some of the September settlement conditions, which will force Wells Fargo to get approval for major plans and senior employment changes. The bank said it had fired more than 5,000 employees in connection with the scandal, which in October forced the ouster of the bank's CEO, John Stumpf, who was brought before Congress and grilled over his knowledge of the sales tactics. The bank also faces federal and state investigations over its practices.Now, Prudential Financial (PRU) is looking into whether Wells Fargo staff also made similar account openings for Prudential's life insurance policies.Wells Fargo once again failed to provide a satisfactory ""living will,"" the Federal Reserve and FDIC said Tuesday. Banks are required to spell out how they would wind down their operations without destabilizing the financial system.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) amended their wills successfully, regulators said.JPMorgan Chase fell 1.2%, Bank of America 2.2% and Citigroup (C) 0.8%, though all three are near record or longtime highs.RELATED:Bank Stocks Push Dow Toward 20,000 After 1-Day Fed PauseWhy Bank Stocks Ended Mixed After Fed Turned More Aggressive On RatesBank Stocks Unfazed After Italy Referendum, Renzi Resignation
"
332,WFC,"Wall Street on Monday shrugged off Italy's referendum vote a day earlier to reject by a wide margin reforms to streamline its government, with U.S.-listed banks largely up in early trading.JPMorgan (JPM) closed up 2% on the stock market today, Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.9%, Citigroup (C) 2.25% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 1.4%.European markets generally advanced. The euro, which plunged to a 20-month low in Sunday trading, rallied Monday when regular trading resumed.Among U.S.-listed European banks, Deutsche Bank (DB) jumped 5.8%, Barclays (BCS) rose 2.5%, UBS (UBS) 3 and Credit Suisse (CS) 2.2%.Shares of Italian banks, which don't trade in the U.S., sold off sharply but didn't collapse. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, seen as among Italy's most vulnerable banks, fell 4.2%. Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl slid 7.9%, while UniCredit was down 3.4%. Italian banks are generally seen as poorly capitalized with heavy bad debts and complex ownership structures.Some analysts had already felt the market had priced in a vote in Italy to reject a proposal backed by the center-left Prime Minster Matteo Renzi, who resigned Monday in the wake of the vote, to shrink the size of the Senate and reduce its powers in attempt to more easily pass legislation.""Investors who panic-sold after Trump and Brexit have been reconditioned to not immediately re-price risk on the back of specific political events,"" Alastair George, Chief Strategist at Edison Investment Research, said in a blog post on Monday.Markets tanked after the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the European Union but rebounded shortly after. Markets rallied following Donald Trump's electoral victory last month, with rising bond yields and expectations of looser regulations lifting bank stocks in particular.IBD'S TAKE: Along with banks, many stocks exposed to Trump's intended infrastructure development have also jumped since the election. Among them: steel companies.  The bump in bank stocks on Monday also comes after a Fed official expressed support for higher interest rates and amid expectations the European Central Bank would slightly extend its bond-buying program this week. New York Fed President William Dudley on Monday said that he favored raising short-term interest rates ""over time"" if the economy continued to perform the way it has been.But critics said the referendum's proposed measures were an attempt by Renzi to consolidate power in his hands. And analysts see the ""no"" vote and Renzi's resignation compounding uncertainty in Italy, whose banks are mired in bad debt and face greater risk of failure if efforts to recapitalize them get sidetracked amid the political turmoil.The ""no"" vote and Renzi's resignation were also expected to mobilize the populist, euroskeptic Five Star Movement, potentially risking more fracturing within the eurozone or European Union if the party gained more power.RELATED:Goldman Sachs A Buy, Miners Upgraded, Quantenna A Top PickSteel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand Growth

333,WFC,"Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, delivering a fiery inauguration speech that promised to unseat the Washington establishment and return power to the American public.""Today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech. ""We are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.""Trump, 70, who has not previously held elected office, took the oath of office shortly at about noon on Friday from Chief Justice John Roberts at the U.S. Capitol. The midday ceremony completed an unorthodox transition of power in which the incoming Republican president relied on social media to set his agenda and address the public.""From this day forward a new vision will govern our land, from this forward it is going to be only America first, America first,"" he pledged.Trump rose to office in November on a populist, anti-establishment wave, defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton with a promise to shake up politics-as-usual and ""drain the swamp"" in the nation's capital. He has vowed to dismantle the policies of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" Trump said. ""Everyone is listening to you now.""Yet Trump enters office with historically low approval ratings — 40% according to Gallup — and a challenge to unite his divided nation. He and his party in Congress already are at odds, especially on the issue of the Russian government's role in electing him. Financial markets, which soared immediately following his election, have recently cooled.Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, rode to the Capitol from the White House in the presidential limousine together with Barack Obama — the first black president, whose legitimacy was once challenged by the man succeeding him.The shared ride to the inauguration is a tradition on a day filled with familiar rituals designed to ease the transfer of power. Obama and his wife, Michelle, hosted Trump and his wife for morning tea at the White House before the motorcade, another custom of the day.The Obamas greeted the Trumps on the White House's North Portico. Obama offered Trump a handshake. Trump gave Michelle Obama a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Melania Trump presented the outgoing First Lady a box wrapped in Tiffany blue.Scattered protests broke out in downtown Washington by activists supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, gay rights and women's rights, and others.A cluster of several dozen people, most dressed in black and with masks over their faces, charged down streets three blocks from the White House smashing windows of about a half-dozen businesses including a Starbucks coffee shop, a McDonald's (MCD) restaurant and branches of Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC). They were pursued by police who used pepper spray in an attempt to disperse the crowd.Protesters spray-painted an anarchy sign on a concrete planter. After police cornered a group of protesters at an office building, people in the surrounding crowd chanted ""you're protecting fascists"" and ""pigs quit your jobs.""Protesters elsewhere in the city were sometimes loud but largely peaceful. They were met by chants from Trump supporters.Even as Trump has defied convention with his reflexive, ubiquitous use of Twitter to excoriate critics and wage partisan warfare during the post-election transition period, he has embraced the pomp and tradition of Inauguration Day.Tens of thousands of people began assembling on the National Mall in the early morning hours, though crowds appeared to be notably smaller than for Obama's two inaugurations. Trains on Washington's subway system, Metro, were largely uncrowded and traffic in the city was light. Inauguration Day is a holiday for most federal workers.Metro said on Twitter that as of 11:00 a.m. in New York, 193,000 people had ridden on the system. That was the lowest figure since at least President George W. Bush's second inauguration in 2005. At the same time in for Obama's inaugurations in 2013 and 2009, 317,000 and 513,000 people had ridden the Metro system.There was a heavy security presence in the Capitol, with parked buses, dump trucks and humvees blocking intersections downtown. Police and soldiers patrolled Metro stations in the vicinity of the Mall.Like past presidents-elect, Trump spent the night before his inauguration at the historic Blair House, a quick walk from the White House. He attended a morning prayer service at St. John's church, known as the President's Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House. The Trumps are to attend three inaugural balls in the evening.Minutes before the Trumps arrived for tea with the Obamas, painters walked in to the White House West Wing carrying gray buckets. Workers rushed through a carefully orchestrated turnover of the presidential residence to prepare for its new tenant.Obama walked from the West Wing along a colonnade connecting to the residence, followed by Vice President Joe Biden. Asked if he felt nostalgic, Obama replied, ""Of course.""The president left a letter for Trump in the desk of the Oval Office, as is tradition for the outgoing chief executive, Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said. He declined to provide a copy of the letter.Trump's campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton, was met by a smattering of boos from Trump supporters when she arrived at the Capitol with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.""I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values,"" Clinton wrote on Twitter before the swearing-in. ""I will never stop believing in our country & its future.""Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was loudly jeered by the crowd at the Capitol as he spoke in favor of gay rights and immigrants ahead of Trump's swearing-in.Trump invited Christian and Jewish clergy to speak at the inauguration: Reverend Franklin Graham, the Southern evangelical and son of Billy Graham; Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles; and Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, an African-American pastor from Detroit.Trump's inaugural address to the nation will be ""very personal and sincere,"" incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, and ""less of an agenda and more of a philosophical document.""Trump was born in the Queens borough of New York, one of five children to Fred Trump, a first-generation German-American, and Scotland-born Mary Anne MacLeod.A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, he took over his father's real estate business, later renaming it The Trump Organization. He drew attention for his flashy style and high-profile deals, some successful and others ending in bankruptcy, including hotels, casinos, an airline and Trump Tower.Trump's celebrity grew with his role as host of NBC's reality-TV hit ""TheApprentice,"" which began airing in January 2004. Contestants with businessskills competed through multiple elimination rounds over the course of aseason. Trump would dismiss losing contestants with the catch phrase, ""You'refired!""Trump considered running for president several times dating back to the late1980s. His political following expanded early in the Obama administration as hechampioned false claims that the president wasn't born in the U.S. and thus was ineligible for the office.Dozens of Democratic U.S. lawmakers planned to boycott Trump's inauguration, and law enforcement prepared for protests throughout the day and the weekend. Trump's advisers hope his opening remarks as president will calm and unify the nation.""The entire national heritage is at stake,"" said historian Douglas Brinkley. ""The one thing that makes our democracy stand supreme to others in the world is that we've been able to do these transfers in a relatively no-drama way.""The body language of Trump and Democrats alike will be parsed, and Trump's every word dissected.""After an election, people feel derailed, the people on the losing end feel derailed, and it's a long hangover, because so much is at stake,"" Brinkley said. ""The transition is supposed to be the healing,"" while ""the oath is the moment that is supposed to flip on our light switches and say, 'We're OK, we're going to move forward.'""Trump has pledged to overturn or revamp almost all of Obama's policies -- on health care, U.S. relations with Russia, China and European allies, his counter-terrorism strategy and environmental protections. He also has pledged to shape a more conservative Supreme Court over time.Vice President-elect Mike Pence was sworn in by Clarence Thomas, a conservative and the only African-American justice currently on the court.Former presidents and their spouses always are invited to inaugurations, but the tradition carries extra poignancy this year. Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara, fellow Republicans who publicly refused to back Trump, are hospitalized and will be absent.

338,WFC,"Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) led a rally in bank stocks Friday, as the strong July jobs report raised the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, potentially boosting lenders' net interest margins.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, far above expectations for 185,000, and hiring gains for the prior two months were revised up. The unemployment rate for July remained at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate crept up 0.1 point. The July figures follow strong results in June, after May's data disappointed.Fed funds futures prices indicate the chances of a rate hike at the central bank's September meeting have doubled to 18%.Shares of Bank of America closed up nearly 4% to 15.05 on the stock market today, gapping above their 200-day average for the first time since late December. Citigroup jumped 4.3% to 45.72, touching its 200-day line. JPMorgan rose 2.7% to 66.30. Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.8% to 48.68, retaking its 50-day line. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 2.6% to 162.09 while rival Morgan Stanley (MS) also rose 2.6%, to end the week at 29.01.IBD'S TAKE: July's jobs figures follow a solid round of earnings reports and stress-test results from the banks this summer. But the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union left the economic landscape there in the balance and led many analysts to believe the Fed would stay cautious on raising rates. A second-quarter roundup can be found here.  Still, the outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain, even though the banks' second-quarter results portrayed a relatively stable consumer outside of the energy sector. Auto sales have also disappointed recently, and concerns have grown about an auto-loan bubble.Companies from McDonald's (MCD) to Starbucks (SBUX) to Delta Air Lines (DAL) have cited the U.S. election, Brexit, and fears of violence in the U.S. and abroad as potentially affecting their business plans and consumer sentiment.

339,WFC,"The marketing heft of Amazon (AMZN) just scored a nice win for its customers and some gravy for shareholders.The online shopping giant announced an agreement Thursday with Wells Fargo (WFC) to provide discounted student loans to Amazon Prime Student customers.Wells Fargo said it will give an interest-rate discount of 0.5 percentage point to Amazon customers, noting that students could reduce their rate by another quarter-point by enrolling in an automatic payment plan.Announcement of the partnership didn't mention whether it was exclusive, but it looks like Wells Fargo is paying Amazon in a bid to increase market share. The deal is an example of Amazon leveraging its membership, much in the same way that AARP has served as a path for companies to tap into senior-citizen consumers via discounts.""We are focused on innovation and meeting our customers where they are -- and increasingly that is in the digital space,"" said John Rasmussen, Wells Fargo's head of its Personal Lending Group, in a statement.The deal could book Amazon Prime Student memberships. They cost $49 a year vs. $99 for the regular Amazon Prime.Amazon shares fell fractionally to 744.43 at the close on the stock market today, tracking modestly below all-time highs and above the 50-day moving average. Wells Fargo dipped 0.6% to 48.30.

340,WFC,"After several days of high-profile bank earnings, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all reported second-quarter results. All but Wells Fargo topped profit and revenue forecasts as financial giants weathered lower interest rates and mostly delivered solid trading and loan growth.JPMorgan reported a scant 1% EPS gain -- and the other five banks reported year-over-year declines. But it could have been worse.""We should keep in mind however that the reassuring piece of these bank results is not that they are great, but rather that they could have been a lot worse,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, said in commentary published online last week, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported. ""After all,"" he added, ""we got into this reporting cycle for the banks with estimates steadily coming down in the wake of lower treasury yields and Brexit-centric uncertainties.""Shares of all six banks have rallied since July 13, just before JPMorgan kicked off industry earnings. All but Goldman and Morgan Stanley were down less than 1% by the close on the stock market today. Goldman was down more than 1% to 160.05 while Morgan Stanley ticked up to 28.87.The second quarter ended with the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. That left the European financial landscape unclear and pushed back any plans for a near-term Federal Reserve rate hike. The Fed's cautiousness will likely keep a leash on banks' future earnings and net-interest margins, potentially forcing them to depend on higher loan volume and fees.""When the low-interest-rate environment is pressuring the traditional lending side of the business, the fee-income side of the business becomes that much more important,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said.JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo and BofA all reported loan growth and said consumer credit quality was strong, even though the debt-addled energy sector continued to be a drag. Money set aside for potentially bad loans rose for JPMorgan and BofA and more than tripled for Wells Fargo. While the bulked-up reserves for Wells Fargo largely reflect difficulties in the energy sector, some of the increase for other banks could reflect natural growth in credit markets.And as the industry looks to lift returns on its capital and other profitability measures back to pre-crisis levels, banks also worked to cut costs during the quarter.""In an environment where revenue growth is challenging, cost cutting becomes all the more important as a way to generate bottom-line growth,"" Stemm said.Meanwhile, Bank of America continued to shake off problems related to the housing bust of nearly a decade ago, and others reported lower legal costs associated with the crisis.""The biggest company-specific risk facing Bank of America has long stemmed from mortgages originated by the company and its predecessors between 2004 and 2008,"" Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal said in commentary published Monday. ""We think the company's troubles on that front are over.""With lower interest rates continuing far longer than many expected, mortgage banking could get a lift in the quarters ahead, while fees from IPOs and mergers could pick up as firming oil prices and other factors help ease economic anxieties in the business world.Equities trading, however, was sluggish during the second quarter, with many banks reporting weaker activity in Asia, where China's economy has cooled. But trading in bonds, currencies and commodities rose for JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which reported results on Monday.The U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union may have helped, with more activity before and after the referendum.""You need this balance or this middle ground where you have some volatility around certain events, but in general the sentiment in the market is still largely positive,"" Stemm said. ""That sort of feels to me like more of the ideal sort of environment for trading results. And I think you got a little bit of of that this quarter, which was helpful.""

342,WFC,"If you want to get in on the latest cyber-reality mobile-device game, download Pokemon Go. If you want to get in on the latest low-cost automated financial advice -- robo-advice -- check out Fidelity Go.Fidelity sees its newly launched Fidelity Go robo-advisory service as an aid to investment management and retirement planning.Fidelity Go caters to relatively young investors with fairly few assets, who are comfortable using online and mobile platforms to manage their portfolios and who might appreciate Fidelity's low-cost offering.""We are looking at emerging customers who are digital savvy, who are about 25 to 45 years old,"" said Rich Compson, head of managed accounts at Fidelity. ""If they are saving for retirement, they've got a long time horizon, so they can take more risk. Their lives are less complicated. They don't have to build (a retirement) income plan or handle complex goal planning. They have $60,000 to $200,000 in assets (on average). And they are comfortable using digital technology to manage their financial lives.""Clients can enter the program with an initial investment of at least $5,000.Only hours into its robo-advice's debut, Fidelity says it is too soon to say how many customers it has attracted. ""But we've seen some feedback that it is an appealing interface,"" said spokesman Rob Beauregard. ""It reinforces what we heard during the pilot (test program), that people like the ease of going through questions (to describe things like their risk tolerance and goals), how and what type of information is displayed. It's not cluttered. It's easy to recognize how your portfolio is doing, how it's invested, that sort of thing.""You can check out the robo service at Fidelity.com by typing ""Fidelity Go"" in the search box in the upper right corner, or by clicking the Investment Products tab and clicking on managed accounts.Retirement and taxable portfolios in Fidelity Go will consist mainly of Fidelity index mutual funds, subadvised by Geode Capital Management. Geode has been a Fidelity subadvisor since 2003. It runs 33 Fidelity funds. It will also help Fidelity monitor client portfolios.Taxable accounts can also include BlackRock iShares ETFs and tax-advantaged municipal-bond mutual funds.Fidelity says its fees will be among the lowest in the robo space. All-in customer costs range from 0.35% of assets for retirement accounts to 0.40% for taxable accounts. Those fees include advisory fees and fees on underlying funds. On a $5,000 account balance, that amounts to an annual levy of $17.50 to $20.In comparison, independent robo-advisor Wealthfront provides free service on accounts up to $10,000 in size, and a management fee of 0.25% on any balance exceeding that, plus annual fund expenses that average 0.12%, according to personal finance site NerdWallet.com. Schwab Intelligent Portfolio levies no management fee. Its fund expenses range from 0.04% to 0.48%.At the high end of charges, robo Personal Capital assesses management fees of 0.49% to 0.89%, plus fund fees that average 0.10%.Customers initially visit Go's Fidelity web page to answer questions about their goals, finances and risk tolerance. Investment strategy and portfolio construction are based on those needs and preferences.As Go's customers get older and wealthier, they may shift to less-automated Fidelity services and asset management, Compson says.Customers will also have phone access to Fidelity's investment service representatives for basic advice. ""If a customer is looking for broader, more in-depth financial information, we would refer him to other services like Fidelity's Portfolio Advisory Services, where he can have access to certified financial planners and other types of advisors,"" Compson said.Fidelity is also still developing a robo-advice service that it plans to offer to independent financial advisors who use Fidelity for custodial and other services, Compson says.IBD'S TAKE: Some big asset managers offer independent financial advisors access to their robo-advisors as a way to grow their practices and meet the new Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary standard, which is due to take effect in April.Typically, each customer will have seven or eight funds in his or her portfolio, Compson says. Geode will be able to choose from the entire universe of funds, Compson adds. Their job is to aim for low-cost funds, using largely passive asset allocation. They can find those among Fidelity index funds, iShares ETFs and Fidelity muni-bond mutual funds, he says, but they are allowed to use others.Fidelity's startup comes amid a flurry of moves in the robo space. Another big player in the mutual fund industry, Legg Mason (LM), entered the robo-advisor field just this month with its acquisition of an 82% stake in Financial Guard, which has $454 million in client assets under management.Wells Fargo (WFC), the world's largest bank by market cap, said that it plans to start a robo-advisory service in 2017. And Qplum, an independent robo-advisor, said it's now taking on investor clients, offering them institutional-style quantitative strategies.

343,WFC,"Stocks held the bulk of morning gains in afternoon trading Thursday, as Yum Brands (YUM) gapped up on a better-than-expected earnings report.The major indexes were headed for their third straight weekly gain, following a quick but sharp sell-off in the wake of the June 24 Brexit vote in the U.K.The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 rose 0.5% each, while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.7% in the stock market today. Volume was tracking slightly higher than at the same time Wednesday on both exchanges.Yum Brands, which owns the Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut chains, surged as much as 6%. It had been tiptoeing out of a cup-with-handle with a 85.89 buy point, and Thursday's move made the breakout convincing. But by afternoon, the stock's gain faded to 3%, at 88.28.Yum Brands late Wednesday reported adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share, a 9% increase from a year earlier. Revenue dropped 3%. The fast-food giant has said it will spin off its Chinese operation, its biggest source of revenue, by October.Banks were among the leading industry groups, mostly up about 2%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 2% after reporting earnings that beat estimates. But investors were also buying banks after the Bank of England surprised the market by holding its policy interest rate at 0.5%, rather than lowering it. That caused the pound to rise by 1.4%. It now trades near $1.33, but it had been as low as $1.28 in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.More banks report earnings over the next few days, with Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) out Friday.

Berkshire recently filed for permission to raise its stake above 10%, but has no plans to do so now.Wells Fargo shares ended the trading day down 2.5% to 47.71 on the stock market today, falling back below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Wells Fargo has a 28 Composite Rating, meaning it outperforms just 28% of stocks based on key fundamental and technical factors. Big winning stocks tend to have very high Composite Ratings before starting their runs. To see how Wells stacks up vs. objective data and vs. rivals, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Citigroup's Q2 EPS fell 18% to $1.24 on an 8.4% decline in revenue to $17.548 billion.

349,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Thursday one day after the Federal Reserve's decision to raise rates and signal more hikes in 2017.Bank of America rose 2.2% on the stock market today, helped by Raymond James upgrade to an outperform rating. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase all climbed more than 1%, while Wells Fargo advance nearly 1%. JPMorgan and Goldman were among the big winners on the Dow Jones industrial average, which is closing in on the 20,000 level. BofA hit a fresh eight-year high intraday, Goldman a nine-year best, and JPMorgan an all-time high.Treasury yields continued their rapid ascent, with the 10-year Treasury rate rising as high as 2.64%.Bank stocks have rallied as bond yields have climbed in anticipation of Fed rate hikes and higher economic growth and inflation under a Trump administration. But on Wednesday, bank stocks initially rallied on the Fed announcement but then pulled back with the general market. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs closed with fractional gains, while Citigroup and JPMorgan edged lower and Wells Fargo retreated 2%.IBD'S TAKE: While bank investors have cheered on the Fed and Donald Trump, gold bugs are scurrying.Part of that may have reflected ""buy the rumor, sell the news,"" as investors had priced in the Fed hike. But another reason may be yield spreads. Banks benefit from wider yield spreads, as they borrow short and lend long. Higher long-term Treasury rates usually mean spreads are widening. But on Wednesday, short-term rates also rose about 10 basis points.While the 10-year yield has hit its best levels since 2014, the two-year yield is the highest since 2008.Over the past three sessions, the yield spread between the 5-year and 30-year bonds has narrowed by 30 basis points, the fastest such move in seven years.RELATED:Fed Sees 3 More Hikes In 2017; 'Fiscal Boost Not Needed,' Yellen SaysBank Stocks Mixed Despite Fed's More Aggressive Rate-Hike View

350,WFC,"Deutsche Bank AG said it reached a $7.2 billion agreement to resolve a years-long U.S. investigation into its dealings in mortgage-backed securities, removing a legal hurdle that fueled investor angst.Deutsche Bank will pay a $3.1 billion civil penalty and provide $4.1 billion in relief to consumers under a settlement in principle with U.S. authorities, which was announced by the Frankfurt-based bank in a statement early Friday. The firm expects pretax charges of about $1.2 billion this quarter because of the fine.While the deal is below the Justice Department's initial request of $14 billion, Germany's biggest lender still faces U.S. investigations into other matters and potentially expensive civil suits. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has made resolving litigation a priority as he seeks to restore confidence in the lender.""The financial consequences, if any, of the consumer relief are subject to the final terms of the settlement, and are not currently expected to have a material impact on 2016 financial results,"" the bank said.Ahead of Friday’s statement, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods had estimated a fine exceeding $9 billion would cause the bank’s capital to fall to dangerous levels requiring action.The bank will publish preliminary 2016 results as scheduled on Feb. 2, it said.Deutsche Bank had set aside 5.9 billion euros ($6.2 billion) for all of its outstanding legal costs as of Sept. 30, when its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at 11.1 percent. The bank targets a level of at least 12.5 percent in 2018. Each $1 billion of litigation costs not covered by provisions would lower the ratio by 20-25 basis points, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Arjun Bowry has estimated.In a related case, the Justice Department sued Barclays (BCS) for fraud over its sale of mortgage bonds after the bank balked at paying the amount the government sought in negotiations. The lawsuit announced on Thursday is rare for big banks, which typically settle with the government rather than risk drawn-out litigation and a possible trial.The Obama administration is pressing to wrap up investigations of Wall Street firms for creating and selling the subprime mortgage bonds that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. Authorities have already extracted more than $46 billion in fines from six U.S. financial institutions over their dealings in mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America (BAC), which had the largest such settlement, agreed to pay $16.7 billion over bonds that were worth four times those of Deutsche Bank.Concern about whether Deutsche Bank had enough capital roiled markets and pushed the stock to a record low after it said in September that the U.S. Justice Department had made the opening request of $14 billion and that it had no intention of paying that amount.The consumer relief will include ""loan modifications"" and other assistance to homeowners and borrowers over at least five years, the bank said.The agreement doesn't resolve probes into whether the bank manipulated foreign-currency rates and precious metals prices and whether it facilitated transactions that helped investors illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. Deutsche Bank also faces civil lawsuits related to claims that its traders manipulated key interbank interest rates. It isn't clear how much more wrapping up these cases will cost.Deutsche Bank already has paid more than $9 billion in fines and legal settlements worldwide since the start of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes settlements related to violations of U.S. sanctions, rigging of interest-rate benchmarks and allegations that it defrauded U.S.-backed mortgage issuers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.A slump in earnings, negative interest rates and challenging markets have caused the bank to continue to struggle this year. Cryan's strategy, announced in October 2015, called for cost cuts and the elimination of dividends for two years to preserve capital. Deutsche Bank has said it may not be profitable in 2016 as it focuses on moving past its legal battles.At least four other European banks remain under investigation over the role of their mortgage-backed securities business: Credit Suisse (CS), UBS (UBS), HSBC (HSBC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). In addition to Bank of America, U.S. banks that have settled include Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Wells Fargo (WFC) and Moody's (MCO) have disclosed U.S. investigations into their mortgage-backed securities dealings and have said they're cooperating.

351,WFC,"Without clear rules of engagement or threats of serious retaliation, warfare in cyberspace is rapidly escalating to uncharted levels, as Russia hacks emails to interfere in the U.S. election, China steals plans for top U.S. weapons programs, and Iran knocks down U.S. banks' networks, costing them tens of millions of dollars.But despite the Pentagon's potent cyber-arsenal — and overall mandate to defend the U.S. from foreign attacks — its mission in cyberspace hasn't extended to regular Americans and companies. That should keep cybersecurity firms like FireEye (FEYE), CyberArk (CYBR) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) as well as defense contractors like Raytheon (RTN) busy on the front lines of the global cyberwar.The debate over the federal government's role is heating up. On Sunday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described the U.S. response to the Russian hacks as ""totally paralyzed,"" after President Obama said Friday that consequences the U.S. inflicts would be done in a ""thoughtful, methodical way."" The U.S. government is already helping industry improve its own defenses by sharing intelligence, and some experts are calling on the government to be a deterrent by threatening to deliver a devastating counterattack in an echo of the Cold War's strategy of mutually assured destruction.""We need to be more transparent with our offensive capabilities,"" said Frank Cilluffo, associate vice president of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, at a conference last month in Washington, D.C. ""What's the benefit of having a doomsday weapon if the bad guys don't know?""Obama took a more measured tone at his year-end press conference Friday, saying some responses to attacks will be public while some will be known only to the recipient and not the broader public.""There have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians,"" he added.But there are already significant sanctions against Russia and its relations with the U.S. have deteriorated sharply, Obama continued, so developing a response that ratchets up costs on Moscow without causing problems for the U.S. is ""worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that's exactly what we've done.""From 2017 to 2021, cumulative worldwide spending on cybersecurity will top $1 trillion, according to a Cybersecurity Ventures report. Damages from cybercrime will cost $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015, the report said. The latest data breach at Yahoo (YHOO) could cause Verizon Communications (VZ) to scrap its $4.8 billion takeover.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) alone spends $600 million a year on cybersecurity and plans to ramp that up to $1 billion in a few years. The federal government is devoting $19 billion for cybersecurity in the fiscal 2017 budget, up 35% from 2016.While banks and retailers with troves of credit-card data have been high-profile targets, a recent Deloitte study found that 40% of manufacturing companies had a cyberattack in the last 12 months. Thirty-eight percent of those attacks resulted in cyberbreaches that caused over $1 million in damages.For now, the private sector is limited to playing defense. It's illegal for companies or individuals to launch a cyberattack or respond with a counterattack under current U.S. laws, according to James Lewis, a senior vice president and program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. International laws have similar restrictions, meaning only governments can launch offensive strikes.Cilluffo said companies should get more leeway to respond to attacks. But even if it were legal for them to play offense, attacks wouldn't necessarily go down in frequency. Previous attempts to fight back have backfired.In 2006, Israeli firm Blue Security responded to spam emails by flooding the spammers with emails of its own. The spammers then directed so much traffic at the company that users were blocked from its site, eventually forcing Blue Security to shut down.Lewis said that one of the big four banks, likely Wells Fargo (WFC) or JPMorgan, was hit by a distributed denial-of-service attack from Iran several years ago and decided to retaliate, before the legality of countermeasures was clear. Instead of silencing Iran, the hackers ""launched overwhelming attacks"" against the bank, prompting it to abandon its own counterstrike.(Wells Fargo said it doesn't comment on specific cybersecurity issues, and JPMorgan didn't respond to a request for comment.)""There is a limited role for companies when it comes to offense, because the risk to the company is just too great,"" Lewis said. ""Companies aren't in the business of fighting wars. They are in the business of making money.""U.S. Cyber Command is the military arm responsible for protecting the Pentagon's networks, with the added responsibility to help defend critical civilian infrastructure like the U.S. financial system and power grid as well as communication and transportation networks.Cyber Command also has acknowledged launching attacks on the Islamic State. Some experts are calling for a strong response to recent cyberattacks from other U.S. adversaries.""We are being taken to the cleaners again and again,"" said Stewart Baker, a partner in the Washington office of Steptoe & Johnson and former assistant secretary for policy at DHS. ""We've been very patient up until now. Our retaliation has been modest and less than proportional.""As a candidate, Donald Trump also talked tough. He pledged in October to beef up the U.S. military's offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, saying ""the United States must possess unquestioned capacity to launch crippling counter-cyberattacks.""But while Trump said cyberattacks from states like China, Russia and North Korea ""constitute one of our most critical national-security concerns,"" he seems unlikely to respond to Russian attacks on the DNC.On Fox News Sunday recently, the president-elect said the intelligence community's assessment that Moscow is behind election interference was ""ridiculous,"" adding that ""it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.""The credible threat that the U.S. would indeed respond is key to preventing attacks.Last year, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC that cyberattacks will get worse ""until such times as we create both the substance and psychology of deterrence.""That role falls to the U.S. government.""We need the government to do things that only the government can do,"" said Nate Fick, CEO of cybersecurity firm Endgame and a former Marine infantry officer, in an interview.And deterrence doesn't just come from a U.S. response in cyberspace or a ""doomsday"" counterattack.""We should consider a cyberattack to not be materially different than any other kind of attack,"" he added. ""And if you think about it that way, then you can actually bring to bear all the elements of power: diplomatic, economic, informational, military. Only if you do that can deterrence work.""If Russian agents had been caught physically breaking into the Democratic National Committee, they would've been tried and imprisoned. Russia's ambassador to the U.S. would've been rebuked or kicked out. Economic sanctions would've followed.Instead, Russia launched cyberattacks precisely because those levers of U.S. power aren't used in such situations, so ""they know they can get away with it,"" Fick said.Some non-cyber tools are already in use, and there are signs they are working.The U.S. saw a decrease in internet Protocol address thefts from the Chinese after the Obama administration threatened economic sanctions, according to Ari Schwartz, managing director of cybersecurity services at the law firm Venable and former cybersecurity senior director on the White House National Security Council.He believes sanctions are the most consistent way to deal with cyberthreats from foreign actors for the long term, even if they are a slower approach to deterrence.""If we respond in the same way, we are legitimizing their action,"" he told IBD. ""We could have a response today that would work. But if it angers a lot of people or throws up new questions about norms or highlights some tool we have ... those would be a detriment.""Fick also said hacking back is ""really stupid"" because companies can't match the resources of a nation-state that chooses to keep escalating attacks.The federal government, while not extending its cyber shield across industry, is deepening its partnerships.Earlier this year, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center began sharing information, including classified threat reports, with certain U.S. companies to help secure their supply chains, according to Bloomberg. The program is aimed at the telecom, banking and energy sectors, alerting them to risks of hacking and other crimes that might exploit information-theft vulnerabilities in suppliers and contractors.Industry also provides the government with the tools it needs in cyberwarfare. Endgame CEO Fick even said the government shouldn't develop its own security products and instead should purchase best-in-breed products, just as the world's biggest companies do.On its website, FireEye said it ""supports nearly every department in the United States government with our services and product offerings."" Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk also have federal government customers.And Raytheon is the prime contractor for the Homeland Security Department system that's responsible for cybersecurity for more than 100 federal civilian agencies and provides support for the Pentagon's networks.Jack Harrington, vice president for Raytheon's cybersecurity business, notes that 85% of U.S. assets on the internet are in the commercial sector.""Clearly, when cyberwar comes it's coming over commercial pipelines with companies in the loop as well as government networks,"" he told IBD.A political consideration also looms over a broader Pentagon role in cybersecurity.Barring an unprecedented, catastrophic cyberattack and clearer policy guidance from the White House, most Americans probably wouldn't support a bigger military role in civilian cyberdefense, says Tony Cole, global government chief technology officer at FireEye.""We have so many organizations in the U.S. focused on civil liberties,"" Cole said. ""And those organizations are very vocal and very concerned that if we allow the DOD to do that without proper controls, then we would have a kind of military state on the internet, something no one wants.""

352,WFC,"President-elect Donald Trump sold all his stock holdings in June, a transition spokesman said Tuesday, reducing possible conflicts of interest while in office.Trump on Tuesday tweeted that the government should cancel a Boeing (BA) order for new Air Force One presidential jets, saying they were too expensive.Spokesman Jason Miller, responding to a question regarding Trump's prior investments in Boeing, said ""The president-elect sold all of his stock back in June."" He later clarified that Trump sold all his stock holdings, not just his Boeing shares.Trump's Boeing stake was worth between $50,001 to $100,000, according to disclosures during the campaign.Trump also held shares of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Visa (V), among his dozens of stock and bond investments.IBD'S TAKE: Many big tech executives opposed Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. Now Trump has invited many tech leaders to meet in New York on Dec. 14.Trump, who already is aggressively using Twitter (TWTR) to target specific companies, also has proposed major corporate tax cuts and regulatory relief. So the divestitures will allay some concerns about conflicts of interest. But critics note that Trump plans to have his children run his businesses, with Ivanka Trump in particular involved in the transition process. Trump is expected to offer more details at a Dec. 15 press conference.Trump aides did not provide any documentation to confirm the stock sales.Boeing shares closed up less than 0.1% on the stock market today, reversing early losses of more than 1%. Apple, Amazon and JPMorgan Chase rose less than 1%, while Wells Fargo climbed 2.2%. Visa edged 0.3% lower.RELATED:Trump Seeks To Shoot Down Air Force One, Targets Boeing ProfitTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

353,WFC,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) continued their postelection ascent on Wednesday after President-elect Trump's pick for Treasury secretary told CNBC he would shuck some Dodd-Frank financial regulations.The bank stocks were also helped by Treasury yields, which rose eight basis points to 2.37% Wednesday afternoon.Bond yields jumped as oil prices spiked on the OPEC agreement to cut oil production. Higher oil prices could spur higher inflation, boosting market rates. A wider yield spread, in turn, could lift profitability for banks, which borrow short-term but lend long-term.JPMorgan rose 1.6% in the stock market today, while Bank of America jumped 4.1%. Citigroup (C) was up 1.6%. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were up 3.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Trump's Treasury pick, Steven Mnuchin, told CNBC that ""we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending."" Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs partner.IBD'S TAKE: As banks rally amid the White House transition, here's a look at why Goldman Sachs and Bank of America could be among the best-positioned banks during the Trump years. Those remarks follow Wall Street's anticipation that a Trump administration and a GOP Congress would ease restrictions on banks put up by President Obama in attempt to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis and Great Recession.Bond yields have also risen on the prospect of Trump's infrastructure-development and tax-cut plans, which some investors believe could increase growth and inflation and dump a huge amount of new government debt into the market. Bond yields rise when bond prices fall.Higher inflation could also raise the likelihood that the Federal Reserve might raise the benchmark interest rate, which would boost the amount that banks take in on loans.RELATED:Citigroup Comes Under ECB Regulation And Is Deemed RiskierU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

354,WFC,"Banking stocks just had their best month in years, so it's little wonder that four bank ETFs are now part of IBD's ETF Leaders screen.IBD's super-regional banks industry group shot up 19.5% in November, the best month since November 1990. Money center banks surged 13.7%, the best month since May 2009. Other banking groups also had a superlative November, far above their normal rates of return.The bank rally actually started in October with positive earnings reports from major companies such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC). But the real burst came after the Nov. 8 election. Republicans won control of the White House and secured majorities in Congress, which brought hopes that banking regulations will be scaled back.Another factor has been rising bond yields, as traders grow more and more convinced that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at this month's meeting. A hike would widen net interest margins for banks.The bank rally has been broad, with participation from small regional players to the largest banks. Even Wells Fargo (WFC), beleaguered by a scandal over unauthorized new accounts, climbed 15% last month.IShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT), SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) are at their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. PowerShares KBW Bank is at the highest level in its five-year history.All four performed comparatively equal in the postelection bash, even though their portfolios vary.The iShares fund — 80% invested in regional banks — has an average market cap of $9.2 billion. SPDR S&P Bank invests in larger institutions. The average market capitalization of its 65 holdings is $35.7 billion. SPDR Regional owns nearly 100 stocks with an average market cap of $13 billion. PowerShares KBW is more narrowly focused on 24 stocks. About two-thirds of the portfolio consists of giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but the rest are midcaps.The four ETFs have continued adding gains this month. But the downside is that it would be difficult to stretch such a phenomenal run even more, and investors are likely late to the party if they attempt to buy shares now.Ahead of the November boom, the ETFs had risen from price bases and had found support at the 50-day moving averages. Those were proper ways to start investing in these instruments. But it will be a while before the ETFs can form new buy areas. None is exhibiting signs of topping, though.In the long term, these ETFs tend to perform much more quietly. For example, IAT has an average annual 10-year return of 0.88%, a period that includes the subprime crisis.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

355,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) faces strict new restrictions after a banking regulator ripped up part of the settlement over its phony accounts scandal.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency late Friday, in a terse statement, revoked some waivers from the September agreement that imposed a $185 million fine on Wells Fargo for opening as many as 2.1 million fraudulent accounts. Wells Fargo said it fired 5,300 workers for the sales practices, but no senior staff were affected, at least initially.The banking giant will now need OCC approval for major business moves or hiring of senior employees. Wells also will be restricted on making so-called golden parachutes to departing staff.The OCC did not explain its unilateral move, which apparently caught Wells Fargo by surprise. But politicians had complained that regulators did impose significant punishment on Wells Fargo for its sales practices and lax oversight. Those charges continued even after CEO John Stumpf resigned and agreed to forgo severance and various stock options.The SEC and Justice Department are conducting their own probes into Wells Fargo.Regulators also may have acted during the current Obama administration. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, and there's a general sense that a Trump administration and GOP Congress will have a lighter touch on banking regulation.Wells Fargo new customer accounts fell 44% in Q3 vs. a year earlier, the bank said on Wednesday, citing fallout from the scandal.Still, Wells Fargo shares have been rebounding in recent weeks. After tumbling in September and October while rival banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) were breaking out of consolidations, Wells Fargo has rallied nearly 15% so far in November.That reflects surging Treasury yields since the election, with expectations that the Federal Reserve will go ahead with an interest rate hike next month.But investors also bet that the bad news for Wells Fargo was priced in. Now, with regulators cracking down and inhibiting business and personnel moves, perhaps for years, investors may think again.
"
356,WFC,"After Wells Fargo (WFC) executive John Sotoodeh handed off more than 100 branches in Southern California to a colleague in 2009, problems surfaced quickly.His successor, Kim Young, addressing rumors that some employees were opening bogus accounts, called an introductory meeting with staff and warned that she wouldn't tolerate misconduct. Within a few days, managers recall, sales crumbled across her new turf.Sotoodeh, who started as a teller in 1990, has since climbed even higher. He's now one of three regional chiefs running the firm's nationwide consumer-banking empire. Young spent the final years of her four-decade career at Wells Fargo weeding out bad employees, retiring in 2014.In interviews, more than a dozen past and current Wells Fargo employees — many of them senior managers — chronicled how a generation of executives thrived in its ambitious sales culture, winning accolades and promotions, while being held aloft as examples to colleagues. All the while, people under them were opening legions of unwanted accounts for customers.As Wells Fargo grew, some stars fanned out from Southern California, described by colleagues and in congressional testimony as a focal point of the rampant misconduct, spreading a culture that lionized boosting sales.Wells Fargo declined to make managers available for interviews but said in a statement that its leaders are closely examining the abuses and are ""intently focused"" on restoring customers' trust. Many of those mentioned in this story, including Sotoodeh, referred questions to company spokesmen. Others declined to comment or didn't respond to messages.Company executives already have identified some current managers to be fired, according to a person with knowledge of an internal investigation. The terminations are being delayed so employees can aid inquiries, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing the matter. The person declined to specify who may be poised to lose their jobs.No one interviewed said they heard senior executives instruct underlings to open bogus accounts, though more than a half-dozen bankers said low-level managers privately coached them to do so.More often, employees said, managers taught underlings to use misleading sales pitches — such as telling customers a checking account came with a credit card — or they balked when subordinates raised concerns. At the least, former managers say, many executives failed to stamp out misconduct for years despite ample signs it was flourishing below them as their own careers advanced.""No one was ever penalized for doing the wrong thing until there was critical mass,"" said Michael Bruns, a banker at Wells Fargo branches in Silicon Valley from 2009 to 2012. ""Instead, they were promoted. They became our bosses and the people who are running the company today.""Bruns said he was fired two months after complaining to the bank's ethics hotline about his colleagues' sales practices.In the statement, Wells Fargo said it takes allegations such as Bruns' seriously and will examine them thoroughly. The San Francisco-based bank has policies prohibiting retaliation for reporting suspected misconduct, and it's conducting an ""an end-to-end review"" of the hotline process. The company said Thursday in a quarterly regulatory filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission is among the authorities examining its sales practices.More broadly, the lender said it's taking a hard look at what happened.""The company's leadership is intently focused on restoring trust in its community bank, making things right with customers and taking actions intended to ensure sales-practices issues do not happen again,"" Wells Fargo said. ""Actions have included naming a new head of retail banking, eliminating product-sales goals and changing the retail bank's risk-management processes and protocols for customer-account activity. As we have disclosed, there are multiple investigations underway to address sales-practice issues, including by an independent committee of the board of directors. The integrity of these investigations is not served by commenting on speculation and rumor. The company will take accountability actions, as appropriate, once it has the facts necessary to act.""The scandal exploded in September with the announcement of $185 million in fines, prompting John Stumpf to step down weeks later as chairman and chief executive officer. Carrie Tolstedt, who oversaw the consumer unit from 2006 until July this year, also left. Together, they're giving up about $60 million of unvested stock. Neither responded to messages seeking comment.The bank's board has publicly promised to investigate how fake accounts proliferated, potentially punishing more executives as warranted.That's a monumental task: The firm's most recent annual report shows the community bank's three U.S. regional chiefs oversee more than 50 regional presidents. Below them, there are about 120 area presidents, each with their own cluster of branches.The bank terminated only one member of that army — an area president — for improper sales over half a decade while firing more than 5,000 lower-level workers, Stumpf said while testifying to a U.S. Senate panel in September.One question lawmakers want answered is whether any of those who remain ever directed employees to open accounts without customers' permission or ignored such misconduct, which authorities have said was widespread. The board's review is expected to take months, according to a person with knowledge of the process. A board spokesman declined to comment.""We failed to acknowledge the role leadership played and, as a result, many felt we blamed our team members,"" Stumpf's successor as CEO, Tim Sloan, said in a speech to staff on Oct. 25. ""That one still hurts, and I am committed to rectifying it.""At the heart of Wells Fargo's sales culture was a metric developed by top brass more than a decade ago, tracking how many financial products and accounts — now dubbed ""solutions"" -- branch employees sold daily. Back then, the focus appeared to be different.Les Biller, chief operating officer from 1998 to 2002, mainly used the figure to set staffing levels, one former senior manager said. If employees fielded more than a certain number of solutions daily, it might signal more tellers were needed at an overworked branch. Biller didn't respond to messages seeking comment.Under Tolstedt, 56, sales volume was the ultimate measure of performance, former employees said. Managers urged workers to boost daily sales and persuade each customer to sign up for more Wells Fargo products, a practice known as cross-selling.Tolstedt ran the division with a style that former colleagues describe as intense and driven, and unrelentingly focused on numbers showing growth. Branch personnel were assigned sales targets that, for years, kept climbing. Their progress was tracked in what some called a ""Motivator Report,"" which circulated daily to managers. It set the tone for conference calls, in which supervisors pressed people below them to meet quotas.Stumpf brought them up, too, emailing high-performing managers to congratulate them and often citing their figures when stopping by local offices, according to one former manager.The bank has said it took steps to prevent cheating, such as increasing ethics training and lowering targets to win bonuses. One manager credited Tolstedt for introducing more metrics to track customer service and satisfaction, emphasizing a need for quality.But for many, the focus on hitting or beating quotas was a monster that underperformers dreaded and the ambitious tried to lasso. Managers who boosted sales typically rose fastest, and some talked incessantly about strategies for doing that, the employees said.Stories of Southern California bankers opening 42 debit cards in a single day percolated among astonished managers in other areas, one person recalled. Several managers who tried to gauge their progress relative to peers said California and Florida often stood out for their new accounts, though many of them were hardly used.After some managers alerted their bosses that the numbers seemed suspicious, they said they were told to mind their own results. Some said they then watched their supervisors climb higher, or at least continued to hold senior posts within the division.Wells Fargo's three U.S. consumer-banking chiefs report to Tolstedt's successor, Mary Mack.Two of them built their careers in California: Lisa Stevens, 46, was promoted to run the state in 2009, and later expanded her territory to cover the Pacific Midwest region, which arcs eastward toward Ohio. She also heads small-business banking. Sotoodeh, 46, oversaw Los Angeles and Orange County before his promotion to lead other Southwest states from Texas.The third region, the East Coast, was run by another former California chief, Laura Schulte, from 2009 until her retirement in 2014. Tolstedt moved her to Charlotte, N.C., just after Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, giving her a key role in integrating the companies. Schulte said in an email to Bloomberg that executives picked her ""due to my extensive experience as a transition manager over several years and acquisitions, rather than anything related to sales practices.""Still, she's remembered by some staff for an internal sales promotion called ""Schulte's All Stars."" A 2010 copy of the list obtained by Bloomberg ranks managers by a mix of metrics, all gauging volume in different ways. Some were on track to be in the ""Schulte Hall of Fame.""Such lists were ""scrubbed carefully so that any one of my winners did not include anyone who was known to be under scrutiny for sales practices,"" Schulte said in her email. She said she wasn't focused primarily on sales numbers, and that she also ran ""recognition events"" tied to employee satisfaction, turnover, customer service and other measures of quality. Promotions, too, were based on a variety of criteria, she said.Schulte also brought along a pair of California all-stars. Darryl Harmon became head of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, and Shelley Freeman ran Florida.Freeman, who previously oversaw metropolitan Los Angeles, soon tried to duplicate its sales-centric culture, former employees said. Every Monday, she wrote an email to thousands of Florida personnel to encourage them to sell, sometimes describing the kind of lifestyle they might hope to achieve. She mentioned her Super Bowl tickets and buying an $800 pair of sunglasses at the beach, one former manager recalled. The messages went to tellers making $12 an hour.Freeman now heads the bank's consumer credit-card business. She said she couldn't immediately comment when reached by phone, and later didn't respond to messages.Forty-five people who worked in Wells Fargo's Florida branches have stepped forward to join a wrongful termination and retaliation lawsuit filed in September by Los Angeles employment lawyer Jonathan Delshad. It was the first such case to be brought after the fines. He provided Bloomberg with a state-by-state breakdown of the roughly 500 potential plaintiffs vetted by his firm so far, showing only California has more, with 144.The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks class-action status for employees ousted or demoted for missing sales quotas while refusing to cheat customers.Some of Sotoodeh's team also got involved with new branches in the southeast. In 2010, members of his staff went to train Wachovia bankers working under Harmon. Soon after the coaches left, the Wachovia staff discovered debit cards in their mailboxes for Wells Fargo accounts they hadn't requested, one person said. The bankers learned months later that members of Sotoodeh's team had used local customers' identities to help meet sales goals, the person said.Wells Fargo's internal crackdown intensified in the years after Sotoodeh handed Young the swath of branches stretching from San Bernardino County to San Diego in Southern California.In 2011, the bank created a ""report card"" to help track sales practices in California, and it delegated a team to sift data for patterns suggesting accounts were bogus, Stumpf told the Senate panel. Two years later, that group launched an ""intensive investigation"" in Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County into a practice known as ""simulated funding,"" he said. At the time, Sotoodeh oversaw both areas.Employees were opening bogus accounts, then depositing funds temporarily to make it look like customers were using them, Stumpf testified. He conceded to lawmakers that sales abuses were especially prevalent in Southern California, and not just because the bank's presence there was large. Both the report card and funding review later expanded nationwide.Other managers from California also assumed leadership posts overseeing broader U.S. regions. Pam Conboy supervised the San Gabriel Valley to the east of Los Angeles when Tolstedt was picked to run the state in 2000. Tolstedt promoted Conboy within the state, and later flew her around the country to teach strategies for increasing sales, managers say. She now oversees Arizona, Nevada and Utah. Conboy didn't respond to messages seeking comment.Conboy, Sotoodeh and Stevens have outlasted many of their colleagues. Of the almost 70 regional supervisors listed in the company's 1999 annual report, they're among fewer than 10 whose names still appeared in an updated hierarchy posted this year.A number of other managers who came up under Sotoodeh around Los Angeles and Orange County are now regional presidents overseeing parts of California and Texas. David DiCristofaro runs greater Los Angeles. Ben Alvarado runs the region that Sotoodeh once handed to Young. Reza Razzaghipour manages an area stretching from Ventura and Santa Barbara inland to Tulare County, while his spouse, Marla Clemow, presides over metropolitan Los Angeles. They declined to comment or didn't respond to messages.One of their peers, Darryl Montgomery, leads Houston. He was the most senior manager below Tolstedt named in a lawsuit by ex-Wells Fargo employees claiming that they were unfairly pressed to meet sales quotas, according to a Bloomberg review of more than 40 court cases. While that 2014 complaint against Wells Fargo is continuing in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims against Montgomery were extinguished in July. He didn't respond to phone messages.Wells Fargo has said it scaled back, and ultimately eliminated, sales goals that regulators faulted for encouraging abusive cross-selling. A new performance plan for retail bankers will be introduced next year. It'll be based on customer service, growth and risk management.The company created a human resources team to help rehire employees who left for performance reasons, Sloan told staff in his speech. And it will hire consultants to review sales practices and address ""cultural weaknesses that need to be strengthened or fixed,"" he said.""I think it all begins with understanding where things broke down, and where we failed — as a culture, a company and as leaders,"" he said.Six years ago, former Wachovia banker Joe Coyne helped run some of Schulte's programs on the East Coast to drive up numbers, such as one called ""Jump Into 2010."" To many managers back then, his was a voice of encouragement, singling out those who beat targets and spurring them to do more.""The performance you both planned for and delivered is nothing short of incredible,"" he wrote in a staff update on the 2010 campaign. ""You have raised the bar higher than many thought possible."" He referred questions about that work to the bank's spokesmen.Last year, Wells Fargo promoted him to a key post within its risk office. Coyne now oversees sales practices across the company's divisions, looking for any conduct that might cause problems.

357,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) disclosed Thursday that its sales scandal is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in an apparent effort to protect investors blindsided by the company's recent scandal over its operating practices.The San Francisco-based bank announced the SEC probe Thursday in a regulatory filing. The review adds to regulatory headaches for the bank, which has faced a barrage of criticism and calls for closer scrutiny since agreeing in September to pay $185 million over claims that employees opened as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts.""The company has responded, and continues to respond, to requests"" from regulators seeking information on its sales practices, the settlements and related matters, according to the filing.Lawmakers called on the SEC, the Department of Justice and others to look more deeply at Wells Fargo amid the public furor over the customer account scandal, which forced the retirements of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the executive who was in charge of the community banking unit. The bank has fired 5,300 workers and said it would eliminate sales goals linked by regulators to its cross-selling strategy.The SEC often reviews whether public companies have failed to disclose issues that are material to shareholders, typically information that could impact their investment decisions. Still, the SEC frequently decides against bringing enforcement cases based solely on this test.""Materiality is what a reasonable investor would consider to be important as part of the overall info he or she looks at when making an investment decisions,"" according to Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor.In the Wells Fargo case, one question is whether the $185 million settlement should have been considered material for a company that reports billions of dollars in profits. The SEC also may be examining whether executives falsely touted the growth in sales numbers with many of the accounts were fake.Lawmakers from both major parties have questioned whether Wells Fargo misled investors by failing to disclose the investigation that led to the September settlement. There also have been concerns raised about whether employees who reported wrongdoing through internal channels were mistreated.Three Senate Democrats, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote to the SEC in September, asking the agency to investigate whether the bank violated whistleblower protection laws by firing employees after they tried to report misconduct.Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, including Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, have also said they've heard from whistleblowers in their districts who were pushed out after reporting misconduct.

358,WFC,"Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated Thursday that the case for an interest rate hike has strengthened and said that it would be ""appropriate relatively soon,"" reinforcing expectations for an increase at next month's policy meeting.Yellen's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress was her first major comments since the election of Donald Trump, who has has criticized the Fed chief's actions. Yellen said she expects to serve out her full term and cautioned against reversing financial reforms.Yellen said in her testimony: ""I expect economic growth to continue at a moderate pace sufficient to generate some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return of inflation to the Committee's 2% objective over the next couple of years. This judgment reflects my view that monetary policy remains moderately accommodative and that ongoing job gains, along with low oil prices, should continue to support household purchasing power and therefore consumer spending.""Thursday's economic data were strong. Initial jobless claims fell last week to 235,000, a 43-year low. October housing starts exploded 25.5% to an annualized rate of 1.32 million units, a nine-year high. The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing index eased in November, but remained positive for a fourth straight month. The consumer price index rose 0.4% vs. September, fueled by higher gasoline prices last month. Year over year, the CPI climbed 1.6%, the most in two years. Core inflation was 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks are in great shape right now. Here's why you shouldn't buy bank stocks right now.Yellen added that there are risks to delaying tightening.""Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee's longer-run policy goals. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.""But she said future moves will be ""gradual.""""The FOMC continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability. This assessment is based on the view that the neutral federal funds rate — meaning the rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel — appears to be currently quite low by historical standards.""Yellen, in a response to a question, says that it is ""fully my intention to serve out my term"" as Fed chief, which runs through January 2018.Trump had criticized the Fed during the campaign, claiming it was acting in a ""political"" fashion. He made it clear he won't nominate Yellen for another term.""When her time is up I would most likely replace,"" Trump said.Trump has vowed to repeal the Dodd-Frank law, but Yellen backed many of the reforms in that sweeping financial regulation overhaul: ""I wouldn't want to see the clock back turned back on those.""More broadly, Yellen said the Fed would watch what Congress does. With Trump proposing big tax cuts and infrastructure spending, the resulting boost to economic growth and inflation would take the pressure off the Fed to provide monetary stimulus.Yellen defended the Fed against GOP Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy's argument that low rates are spurring businesses to buy back stock vs. invest.It's not my clear to my mind why investment spending has been as weak it is,"" she said. ""I wouldn't agree the Fed's monetary policy has hampered business investment.""Stocks rallied Thursday, extending gains after Yellen's testimony ended. The dollar rose to a fresh 13-year high.Treasury yields rose solidly. They've spiked since Trump's election, accelerating a recent uptrend in bond rates, especially at the long end, in recent months.Bank stocks have rallied strongly on the widening yield spreads, which should boost core profitability. Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and a slew of other lenders skyrocketed last week and have largely held those gains this week. Shares of all five banks rose about 1.5% on the stock market today except for JPMorgan, which edged up 0.8%.Yellen acknowledged in her testimony that while labor markets are tightening, blacks and Latinos still have high unemployment and low median incomes.""While the improvements in the labor market over the past year have been widespread across racial and ethnic groups, it is troubling that unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics remain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median African American household and the median Hispanic household is still well below the median income of other U.S. households.""RELATED:GOP Won't Kill Filibuster, So Cover Your Treasury Shorts

359,WFC,"The major market averages largely retreated during late-morning trade Monday after following big gains last week, with large-cap techs including Apple (AAPL) and Alibaba (BABA) continuing to feel selling heat. But small caps continued to strengthen as more money flowed into banking shares, including Home Bancorp (HOMB) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL).The Nasdaq composite was down nearly 0.4% after climbing 3.8% last week. The tech-heavy index was down nearly 0.8% earlier in the session before rebounding some. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%.In addition to the banking sector, retail, apparel, ship transport and hospital shares rallied sharply to offset heavy declines in internet content, retail internet, gold mining, financial software and desktop software stocks.The Russell 2000 rose 1.3%, off fresh all-time highs earlier in the session. The small-cap gauge vaulted more than 10% last week and hit its highest level since late June of 2015.The Dow Jones industrials rose to a new high intraday, supported by strong gains by components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), but the Dow was barely higher in late morning action. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at the end of its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hit 2.22%, up sharply from its July low of 1.37%. Higher interest rates tend to boost the profit margin on loans issued by banks.Other large cap banks also rallied. Wells Fargo (WFC) rose more than 3% to 53.34, reaching price levels not seen since January. The giant in mortgages, consumer lending and business banking has been in a slow burn since July 2015 but is getting closer to breaking past resistance near 56.Aggressive traders could buy the stock as it's broken a downtrend line that can be drawn on a weekly chart going back to the 58.74 high set in July last year.As seen in Wells Fargo's weekly chart, the stock has been forming a bottoming base pattern, and the relative strength line, painted in blue, has been spiking in a near-vertical fashion since Nov. 9, a day after Donald Trump scored a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton for the Oval Office. The best stocks show fast-rising RS lines, meaning they are sharply outperforming the S&P 500's current performance.Watch to see if Wells Fargo's Relative Strength Rating improves from its lowly 54, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. The RS Rating of 54 means that Wells Fargo is outperforming only 54% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months. The Composite Rating is not much better at 64.Apple is floundering after retracing the nearly 8% gain past a 110.33 buy point. Those who bought shares at that price level can decide to see if it the stock will hold above 102.61, which would be the price level in which to cut losses at 7%. In morning trading, Apple hit an intraday low of 104.08.But today's stock market action has been discouraging for many large-cap tech companies as institutional players appear to be taking profits and rotating money into beaten down sectors such as coal, steel, banking and biotech.Thus, it makes sense for new buyers to cut their losses in Apple even more quickly. For now, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is still trading above the long-term 200-day moving average, currently near 103.88 and above the price that triggers IBD's golden sell rule of cutting losses at 7%-8%.Apple's up/down volume ratio, which compares turnover on up days in price vs. down days over the past 50 trading sessions, fell to a neutral 1.0 last week, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. The ratio rose as high as 1.3 four weeks ago.Crude oil futures sank again, as West Texas Intermediate futures fell more than 1.2% to $42.85 a barrel. Gold futures on the Comex lost 0.9% to $1,213.70 per troy ounce.RELATED:Will A Trump Presidency Keep The Bull Market Going?How Does The Bottoming Base Pattern Help Investors Make Money?When Did Apple Initially Break Out?Know This Sell Signal: Keep Losses In All Of Your Stocks Small

Independent Director Elizabeth Duke will serve as vice chair. Sloan was also named to the board.The news comes after Stumpf, who reportedly will not receive a severance payment, faced intense criticism from lawmakers and others following the bank's cross-selling scandal, in which authorities said Wells' sales staff created up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts in an attempt to hit sales goals.""While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside,"" Stumpf said in a statement.""John Stumpf has dedicated his professional life to banking, successfully leading Wells Fargo through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history, and helping to create one of the strongest and most well-known financial services companies in the world,"" Sanger said in that statement.

367,WFC,"Clouds are gathering over the robo-advisor industry. And the forecast should inspire investors who use robo-advisors to keep an umbrella nearby, according to a prominent observer of the robo-advisor space.Robo-advisors are finding it increasingly difficult to grow their rate of asset inflow.IBD'S TAKE: Having their own robo-advisor may be a good strategic move for asset managers, but investors should think twice before buying these stocks now. The Finance/Investment Management Group has lagged the general stock market over the past six months, ranking 119th out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. To find the groups that are leading the market now, bookmark the daily IBD Industry Themes column.And while that does not put investors' account balances in jeopardy, ""it increases the risk that some robo-advisors may have to raise prices in the coming year,"" Michael Kitces, director of wealth management for Pinnacle Advisory Group and a prominent commentator on the retirement-funding industry, told IBD.Still, even after a price hike, robo-advisors' fees may remain well below what full-service brokerages, for example, charge. On an account balance of $125,000 with a 60-40 stock-bond mix, prominent robo services like that of Charles Schwab (SCHW) levy a 0% annual robo fee plus a 0.23% average ETF expense ratio, according to investorjunkie.com. Betterment assesses a 0.15% robo fee plus a 0.15% average ETF fee. Vanguard charges a 0.30% robo fee plus a 0.09% average ETF fee. In contrast, full-service wirehouses tend to sock clients with fees of 1% to 1.5%.Asset-gathering growth rates are falling rapidly for robo-advisors, especially independent ones, Kitces says. Key robos' growth of assets under management (AUM) is just one-third of what it was one year ago, Kitces wrote on his website. Wealthfront is growing AUM at a little more than 2% annually, down from above 6%. Betterment's growth rate north of 6% is down from better than 17%.Dan Egan, Betterment's director of behavioral finance and investing, says asset growth can reflect temporary factors such as overall market run-ups or pullbacks. Robo-advisors in general and Betterment in particular, he says, remain very popular. And Betterment's AUM continues to grow in dollar terms, he adds. ""Betterment is the largest and fastest growing (robo-advisor),"" he said. ""When something gets very large, growth is harder to sustain on a percentage-wise basis.""Robos' slowing pace of AUM growth reflects high client acquisition costs and an inability to achieve economies of scale.The slowdown could force some robos to shut down or, ""more realistically, to be sold,"" Kitces told IBD. If your robo-advisor folds, you would not lose assets -- but you would have to transfer your account holdings to another asset manager, he says.""Fortunately, many of the independent robo-advisors have raised significant capital (from investors in the advisory firm itself) though. So even that prospective 'day of shutdown' (or 'forced sale') could still be a long, long ways off,"" Kitces said.""In terms of costs, though,"" he continued, ""a growth slowdown is not a good thing, especially since many (industry observers) have noted that robo-advisors don't even appear to be profitable (or financially viable) at their current pricing and volume of clients. If they can't dramatically increase the number of clients and scale,"" price hikes by robo-advisors will be more likely in the next 12 months, to avoid running out of operating capital.Egan says Betterment is not considering any such move. His shop's growth, he adds, will enable it to fund continued innovation and new services, such as January's rollout of its 401(k) plan offering.Kitces says it is unclear whether robos' root problem is that competition is crimping their ability to attract net new assets, or that they ""grossly underestimated the challenge of getting clients in a scalable manner.""The net amount of new dollars flowing into robo coffers has stayed even, he says. Robos are not taking in less money.""It's just that taking in the same money as the base gets bigger means the growth rate is falling. Getting $100 million per month when Betterment (had assets under management of) $1 billion was a 10% monthly growth rate,"" he said. ""Getting the same $100 million now when Betterment is $5 billion (in AUM) is only a 2% monthly growth rate.""Worse, Kitces cites research that says robo-advisors need tens of billions of dollars in AUM to be profitable and financially healthy. So to become and remain profitable, their asset-growth rate must rise, not decline, he says.Of 13 active robo-advisors that investorjunkie.com views as big enough to track, the only one with more than $10 billion in assets is Vanguard's, which has $31 billion in AUM. That's just a fraction of Vanguard's overall AUM, which topped $3 trillion as of Dec. 31. The next-largest is Schwab's with $8.2 billion.The slowdown in AUM growth comes as Wells Fargo (WFC), the world's largest bank by market cap, said on Wednesday that it plans to start a robo-advisory service in 2017.And yet another big player in the mutual fund industry, Legg Mason (LM), just entered the robo-advisor field with its acquisition of an 82% stake in Financial Guard, which has $454 million in AUM.Legg Mason had $718 billion in assets under management as of May 31.The move gives Legg Mason a beachhead in the robo-advisor space. Despite robo-advisors' profitability woes, they've attracted investors largely with their offering of low-cost, automated, online investment strategies, which typically make heavy use of ETFs.In contrast to independent robo-advisors, the outlook may be easier for robos that get gobbled up. Financial Guard now gets access to Legg Mason's deep pockets and distribution channels. A Legg Mason news release said, ""The transaction expands Financial Guard's access to financial institutions that serve the needs of investors.""Does the slowdown in growth make robo-advisors less crucial for asset managers to have as an option for their clients? Big mutual fund shops and other asset managers that don't have their own robo-advisor still risk losing out on a meaningful number of clients and their assets. Robo-advisors' cumulative share of assets under management by advisors of all stripes should rise to 5.6% by 2020, up from 0.5% in 2015, research firm A.T. Kearney forecasts.Legg Mason said its Financial Guard deal would help financial advisors who partner with it to grow their practices and meet the new Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary standard, which is due to take effect in April.The DOL rule aims to prevent brokers who provide retirement plan advice from putting their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests. Brokers could meet the new standard by making use of low-cost robo-advisors, at least with some small-account clients. Otherwise, many advisors might avoid taking on small-account clients because it would not be profitable to provide them with service without charging higher fees. But by avoiding smaller accounts, an advisor would risk losing a client whose account could grow over time.Reflecting this concern, Legg Mason noted that there is about $845 billion in small IRA accounts holding less than $25,000 each at U.S. wirehouses, independent broker-dealers and regional brokers that may be impacted by the new DOL rules.""Legg Mason will offer the Financial Guard platform to firms who are looking for technology solutions to assist them in meeting expanded compliance requirements in a holistic, cost efficient way,"" the release said.The DOL deadline has helped drive a wave of acquisitions similar to the Legg Mason move in the past 18 months. BlackRock (BLK) took over FutureAdvisor last summer. Invesco (IVZ) grabbed Jemstep early this year. UBS (UBS) bought a stake in SigFig in May.Other key players in the mutual fund industry have created their own robo-advisory services:Legg Mason announced its move earlier this month.

368,WFC,"When it comes to the direction of interest rates, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words may be more important than Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's.While Yellen's testimony to Congress on Thursday morning will be closely scrutinized, the big news on Wednesday was that GOP leaders in the Senate have ruled out the idea of killing the filibuster, which generally means that 60 votes will be required to move legislation.Republicans do have another trick — actually two tricks — up their sleeves to move legislation to cut taxes and replace ObamaCare. They can use the same reconciliation technique used by President Obama to pass ObamaCare in 2010, and the GOP has signaled that it intends to do so twice. Yet that legislative vehicle will require changes in taxes and spending to be budget neutral, at worst.The upshot is that there's a limit to the amount of fiscal stimulus that President-elect Trump will be able to deliver, and the need for budget neutrality may draw out the legislative process, since that means there will be winners and losers. On top of that, the spike in Treasury yields since Trump's surprise win could have a dampening effect on the housing market and auto sales, which may have already peaked.IBD'S TAKE: Janet Yellen signaled Thursday that Fed rate hikes are coming soon, but not fast and furious.Even so, shares of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), a Trump campaign punching bag for its plans to shift small-vehicle production to Mexico, have moved slightly higher since the election. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks, especially regional banks, have flown on both the prospect of widening yield spreads lifting net interest margins, as well as on expectations of a lighter regulatory touch in a Trump administration.Still, the lack of near-term catalysts suggests the sell-off in Treasuries, with the 10-year yield rising nearly a full percentage point from the historic low seen in July, may have run its course for now. That's not to say there will necessarily be a substantial pull-back. Average hourly wage growth has accelerated and is now up an annualized 3.1% over the past six months, as companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and Panera Bread (PNRA) have been hiking pay as they compete for the best talent. The labor market is getting tight and wage pressures are beginning to feed through to higher inflation.On the other hand, the rise in the dollar also is a negative for U.S. growth. Meanwhile, there is enough uncertainty overseas, including a big constitutional referendum in Italy next month, that Treasuries may continue to see safe-haven buying.While an infrastructure package could deliver a boost, the plan to emphasize public-private partnerships may slow the funding of shovel-ready projects. Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and U.S. Steel (X) have been among the biggest stock-market winners since Trump's election. Steel makers would benefit from a big boost in infrastructure spending, as well as from Trump protectionist moves.RELATED:3 Reasons Why Wage Growth Is About To Take OffSteel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand GrowthBofA, JPMorgan, Other Bank Stock Charts Look Great Despite Pullback

369,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other financials are pulling back on the stock market today. But is the bank rally over? A quick look at their charts show that financial stocks are doing just fine, holding onto the vast majority of last week's huge advances.Consolidating gains is natural and healthy. Most of the banking stocks are well extended, but sideways action could present new buy opportunities down the road.Bank of America fell 2% to 19.75. Baird downgraded BofA and a few other financials Tuesday, BofA's second analyst cut of the week.""We think the bank rally post-election has largely discounted potential benefits from rising interest rates, lower tax rates, and more aggressive capital return. We believe investors should book gains and wait for more evidence that the structural improvement in macro trends and regulations will materialize,"" said Baird analyst David George in a report.But Wednesday's loss follows a fractional gain Tuesday and a 15% spike last week. Bank of America had already cleared a 16.34 buy point ahead of the election, as rising long-term bond yields and rising odds of a Federal Reserve rate hike buoyed bank stocks. Donald Trump's election win and the prospect of growth-and-inflation-boosting tax-and-infrastructure plans just hit turbo on the sector's solid advance.Shares are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Check out the weekly chart:RELATED:Bank Of America Downgraded AgainIBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks aren't the only Trump rally group to pause. Military contractors are consolidating their huge gains, with Lockheed, Boeing and other top defense stocks in or near buy range.JPMorgan slid 2.5% to 77.40. Shares fell slightly on Tuesday, but closed near session highs. JPMorgan is still up slightly this week after soaring 13% last week. Before that, JPMorgan had been in buying range as shares rose glacially from an early August breakout.Check out the weekly chart:Citigroup retreated 1.5% to 54.63, but is up solidly this week after gaining nearly 10% last week. Citigroup cleared a 48.28 buy point in early October, but pulled back to close just below that pivot on Nov. 4, though it did find support at the 50-day line. Citi retook its entry point the next day, then soared postelection.Check out the daily chart:Wells Fargo sank 1.7% to 51.68. Wells Fargo also fell modestly Tuesday, but after hitting a 2016 best on Monday. Wells Fargo shot up 16% last week, retaking its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Wells Fargo shares tumbled in September on news of a fraudulent accounts scandal, so the bank didn't break out like its peers. But it could consolidate at current levels, perhaps form a handle, and present a potential buy point.Here's Wells' weekly chart:Goldman Sachs pulled back 2.3% to 206.26, snapping a seven-day winning streak. Goldman climbed 16% last week.Check out the weekly chart:It's not just global banking titans that are looking good. Super-regional banks such as US Bancorp (USB) and smaller players such as Zions Bancorp (ZION) and East West Bank (EWBC) are also pulling back in constructive fashion after huge gains.RELATED:Financials Dominate New Highs, But Be Careful Not To ChaseBank Stock Run Continues As Bond Yields Fly

Jefferies also upped Stag Industrial (STAG) to buy.Schlumberger shares rallied 3.1% to 81.16, but that likely is mostly due to surging oil futures Tuesday.In other analyst moves, Stifel downgraded FedEx (FDX) to hold with a price target of 186, RBC Capital upgraded Harley-Davidson (HOG) to sector-perform; Pacific Crest Securities initiated Atlassian (TEAM) at neutral; FBR Capital downgraded American Eagle (AEO) to market perform and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) to underperform.RELATED:Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan

371,WFC,"Riding a spike in Treasury yields, bank stocks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) rose to their highest levels in years, continuing their gains since Donald Trump's unexpected election last week.JPMorgan jumped 3.7% in the stock market today, after hitting a record high last week. Bank of America rose 5.6% to levels not seen since 2008. Citigroup (C) advanced 3.5%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 2.2%.Goldman Sachs (GS) was up 2.6%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) added 2.2%. U.S. Bancorp (USB) rose 1.7%, KeyCorp (KEY) 2.8% and PNC Financial Services (PNC) 2%.Home Bancorp (HOMB), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and East West Bancorp (EWBC) are among the many other banking stocks extending powerful gains.Those stocks are all well past buy range, but could still maintain strength and present buying opportunities in the event of a correction.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes leapt 10 basis points to 2.25%, continuing huge gains since last week. SPDR Financial (XLF) an ETF whose investments include a variety of financial stocks, rose 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Ever since President-elect Trump last vowed to improve the nation's infrastructure, investors have renewed their focus on the stocks that could benefit. Here's a broader look at what stocks could drive a potential bull market in the Trump era.The rising yields come as investors anticipate stronger growth and higher inflation due to Trump's plans for tax cuts a wave of new public infrastructure spending. Markets are also betting that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, with perhaps more tightening in 2017.Short-end Treasury yields also have risen sharply since the election and in recent weeks, but not nearly as much as the long end. That means banks, which borrow short and lend long, should see higher profitability.Banks could also benefit from fewer regulations under a Trump administration.RELATED:Profit Recession Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014Banks ETFs Rise To Build On Trump Windfall, At Best Level Since 2008JPMorgan Hits Record As Banks Extend Gains; CEO Dimon At Treasury?U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

372,WFC,"A Citigroup (C) Irish subsidiary will be regulated by the European Central Bank starting next year, a move that could allow the bank to more easily sell financial services across much of the European Union following the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the bloc.That subsidiary, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was deemed on Monday to be large enough and important enough to be supervised by the ECB following its merger last year with the U.K.'s Citibank International, according to Reuters.If a bank's assets within a eurozone nation, like Ireland, become large enough, they can become eligible for ECB supervision, Reuters notes. The ECB supervision gives a bank easier access to the eurozone's financial market.Analysts have been concerned that U.S. banks that use London as a springboard into the rest of the European market could have more difficulty accessing the rest of the European Union as the U.K. renegotiates how it does business with the rest of the Continent.Citigroup in particular also faces concerns about its prospects in Mexico, a nation it believes has ""tremendous untapped potential,"" if President-elect Donald Trump takes a tougher stance on international trade.Citi's Irish subsidiary oversees the bank's retail operations in Europe, but not its trading and brokerage businesses, Reuters said.Shares rose 8 cents to 55.54 in the stock market today, following a steep postelection climb upward.IBD'S TAKE: Along with bank stocks, steel stocks have also surged following the election on expectations that Trump's infrastructure plans could bring more demand and investment to the industry. The new oversight from the ECB comes as the Financial Stability Board on Monday said that Citigroup's risk to the global financial system had risen since last year.The international board put Citigroup in second-highest tier of global systemically important banks, or banks considered essential to the world's financial health. JPMorgan (JPM) was the only other bank in that tier; no banks were in the highest. The more important the bank, the tougher their capital requirements those banks face.Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also had their risk profile raised by the board, which was formed in 2009 and consists in part of the G-20 nations.Citigroup on Monday also said that it would raise its stock buyback plan by as much as $1.75 billion.JPMorgan rose 0.4%, while Bank of America climbed 1.65%. Wells Fargo slid 1.3% after a banking regulator late Friday voided key parts of the phony accounts settlement and imposed strict new conditions.

The metal, which is vital to many industries, rose 2.6% Monday, 3.1% Tuesday and 4% Wednesday. Some market watchers say the strength in copper is a Trump play.

387,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS), the Wall Street bank most reliant on trading, posted a 74 percent increase in second-quarter profit as legal costs fell and fixed-income revenue surpassed analysts' estimates.Net income rose to $1.82 billion, or $3.72 a share, from $1.05 billion, or $1.98, a year earlier, when the company had a $1.45 billion provision for legal and other regulatory matters, New York-based Goldman Sachs said Tuesday in a statement. Eighteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated per-share earnings of $3.05.Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 61, is trying to ride out a years-long slump in bond trading by dismissing employees, investing in technology and carrying out the biggest expense cuts in years. More than 400 employees have been dropped this year, including traders and salespeople in the securities unit.""We achieved solid results by continuing to serve our clients across our diversified franchise and by managing our business efficiently,"" Blankfein said in the statement.Goldman Sachs's struggles with fixed income show how idiosyncrasies in Wall Street's elite club can mean the difference between billions of dollars in revenue, and they highlight a challenge to the firm's business model. The franchise that trades bonds, currencies and commodities -- which once fueled record profits -- has dropped behind top U.S. competitors in recent years, leaving its market share in the 12 months through March the smallest since the financial crisis.Net revenue in the second quarter dropped 13 percent to $7.93 billion. Fixed-income trading revenue rose 33 percent to $1.93 billion. Equities trading generated $1.75 billion, an 11 percent drop. The trading figures exclude an accounting adjustment in last year's second quarter.The bank completed the purchase of the online bank of General Electric (GE) in the second quarter, adding more than $16 billion in deposits in one of the most-watched strategy shifts at Goldman Sachs, which became a bank holding company after the financial crisis. The firm is also developing a consumer-lending operation as it seeks to do more business with Main Street.IBD's TAKE: Goldman Sachs shares have been rising, but are still below their declining 200-day moving average, where they've been stuck for the past eight months. While we focus on Wall Street, the best-looking Money Center banks are all Canadian, including Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY). Both are setting up in consolidations.Goldman Sachs fell 9.4 percent this year through Monday, compared with a 1.1 percent decline for the S&P 500 Financials Index of 92 firms and a 6.4 percent advance for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Goldman Sachs is the fifth of the six biggest U.S. banks to report results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) kicked off earnings season last week by beating estimates as fixed-income trading revenue and loan growth jumped. Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) also exceeded estimates, while Wells Fargo (WFC) results were in line with expectations. Morgan Stanley (MS) is scheduled to report on Wednesday.

The NHTSA already is probing various Tesla Autopilot accidents. Consumer Reports urged Tesla to disable the self-driving mode. Tesla fell modestly for four straight days but still closed the week up 1.7% and above its 50-day line. Tesla rose 3.7% Monday after Elon Musk tweeted Sunday night that he would soon release ""Secret Masterplan, Part 2.""In a strong sign for initial public offerings, Japan-based messaging company Line bolted out the gate on its first day of U.S. trading Thursday, rising 27% to 41.58, then retreated 4.6% Friday to close at 39.65. Line's newly minted U.S. shares had priced at $32.84. It raised $1.1 billion, making it the largest technology IPO this year. Line follows the successful tech IPOs of Twilio (TWLO) and Acacia Communications (ACIA).JPMorgan kicked off the banks' second-quarter earnings season Thursday with view-topping results. Consumer loans and trading were strong, and JPMorgan said that wholesale and consumer credit quality ""remained very good"" outside of the embattled energy sector. Citigroup (C) also reported second-quarter results that topped expectations. Wells Fargo (WFC) matched EPS expectations but missed on revenue, though mortgage banking losses shrank.Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next week.JPMorgan rose 3.8% and Citi shares 5.6% for the week, while Wells dipped 0.2%.The parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut reported a 9% year-over-year Q2 adjusted earnings gain to 75 cents, topping by a penny, on a 3% revenue decline $3.01 billion. Analysts had expected $3.09 billion in sales. But Yum Brands (YUM) raised full-year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 14%, up from a prior outlook of 12%. Same-store sales were unchanged, and Yum said its China unit has started off Q3 well. McDonald's (MCD), which is seeking a partner for its China operations, reports July 26.Yum shares rose 2% to 87.49 for the week, retaking an 85.89 buy point.Airbus (EADSY) won 279 orders and commitments worth $35 billion at list prices at the Farnborough Airshow thanks to a massive 100 plane order from AirAsia. That easily beat Boeing (BA), which got orders for 182 aircraft, valued at $26.8 billion. But orders at the biannual show were weak overall and analysts are concerned that Boeing and Airbus won't reach their projected sales targets for the year. Boeing did well on the defense side, as the U.K. finalized a $3.88 billion contract for nine new P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft. British officials also announced a deal for 50 Boeing Apache helicopters.Boeing shares rose 1.8% for the week, but is once again finding resistance at its 200-day line.Airbus stock soared 7.6%.Nintendo (NTDOY) shares shot up 61% for the week and 89% since the July 6 release of augmented-reality mobile game ""Pokemon Go,"" developed by Alphabet (GOOGL) spinoff Niantic. The app's daily active user base has already zipped past that of Twitter (TWTR), and ""Pokemon Go"" is installed on over a tenth of all U.S. Android phones, more than ""Candy Crush Saga"", LinkedIn (LNKD) or Lyft, according to SimilarWeb. The analytics firm said that on July 11, 5.9% of U.S. Android users had opened the PokemonGo app, above Twitter's 4.1% and closing in on the 8.3% who accessed popular app Snapchat that day.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings per share but just missed. The carrier said the era of cheap oil boost profits is largely over. Delta said it's aiming for unit revenue growth by year-end. Delta says it will curb capacity growth in Q4, partly due to the Brexit vote's impact on the economy and the pound. But it won't reduce capacity outright.Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) (IBD) forecast Q2 unit revenue that was better than earlier forecasts. American also inked credit card deals that it said would bring in $1.55 billion in pretax income through 2018.Airline stocks have rebounded somewhat from post-Brexit vote sell-offs. They fell Friday following Thursday night's deadly terror attack in Nice, France but still closed up sharply for the week.No one expects the Fed to raise rates at its meeting later this month. And markets don't see much of a chance of a hike this year. But it no longer seems completely off the table. Stocks are at record highs, more than recouping brief post-Brexit losses. Meanwhile, U.S. and Chinese economic data signal solid growth, if not acceleration.U.S. Economic DataJune retail sales rose 0.6%, far better than expected. They rose 0.7% excluding autos and gas. E-commerce and other nonstore sales rose 14.2% vs. a year earlier, the best in a decade. Core consumer inflation matched its highest level since September 2008. Industrial production rose the most in 11 months. Those reports follow the prior week's strong jobs and U.S. manufacturing data.China's Growth StabilizesThanks to massive credit-driven stimulus, China's economy expanded 6.7% in Q2 vs. a year earlier, matching Q1's gain and slightly better than views for 6.6%. GDP growth is still the weakest since Q1 2009, but suggests that the world's No. 2 economy is finding its footing. June data for industrial production, retail sales and lending all were stronger than expected and accelerated from May.Rail operator CSX (CSX) said Q2 EPS fell 16% to 47 cents, but that topped views by 3 cents. Revenue dropped nearly 12% to $2.7 billion, edging forecasts for $2.69 billion. Coal volume tumbled more than 30%, a problem throughout the industry.Shares climbed 7.4%, hitting their best levels since late November.Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) report earnings in the coming week, with Norfolk Southern (NSC) due out July 27.No. 1 aluminum and alumina maker Alcoa (AA) reported that second-quarter earnings per share fell 21% to 15 cents, but that topped analyst estimates by 6 cents a share, and was improved from Q1's 75% year-over-year plunge. Revenue fell 10% to $5.3 billion amid lingering effects of the commodity price slump last year and early 2016, topping Wall Street views for $5.2 billion. Alcoa, which is splitting its value-added auto and aerospace manufacturing business into a separate firm called Arconic, forecast strong growth in the aerospace industry next year.Alcoa stock is up 11.2% this week.

390,WFC,"Stocks resumed their rally Thursday after taking a bit of a breather in the prior session. Goldman Sachs and Apple boosted the Dow industrials to a new record high, while Japan's Line scored the biggest tech IPO this year.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.7% jump, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.

393,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday said it was too early to gauge the long-term financial impact of the sham-account scandal, but its dividend, which has made the stock attractive over the years, appears intact even as regulatory scrutiny intensifies.When asked by an analyst during a conference call if the potential litigation and government investigations that Wells Fargo faces will affect its capital return plans, Tim Sloan, the bank's new CEO, said, ""Overall, it doesn't.""Specifics were scarce about customer retention and the long-term financial impact of the scandal, which prompted the resignation of its CEO, damaged its reputation and raised questions about the sales practices at other banks. (JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) CFO on Friday said it had found some cross-selling issues but ""no systemic issues"" as it investigates its own sales methods.)Still, some early indications trickled out. While Wells Fargo said that overall customer traffic to bank branches and call centers had held at ""typical"" levels for September, the month when news first broke of the fine, other metrics saw declines.Customer checking-account openings fell 25% during September, while credit-card applications sank 20% and customer visits with branch bankers were down 10%, the company said.""Customer visits with bankers, account openings and applications were down on lower referrals, marketing activity and product offerings,"" Wells Fargo said in its earnings presentation.It added: ""Customer experience scores trended down but were in line with historic performance.""The bank said that shifting more staff to its corporate-risk functions in the wake of the scandal could cost ""tens of millions of dollars.""Shares of Wells Fargo dipped 0.1% to 44.71 in the stock market today, despite strong Q3 results. JPMorgan and Citigroup (C), which also topped Q3 forecasts, fell 0.3% and by 2 cents, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis.During the call, Wells Fargo again expressed regret over the scandal, in which authorities said that members of its sales staff created as many as 2 million unauthorized or sham accounts in an attempt to hit sales targets.Wells Fargo in September was hit with a $185 million fine as a result. The bank's former CEO, John Stumpf, faced a grilling before Congress afterward.Management on Friday outlined a variety of measures intended to strengthen the verification process and said ""all good ideas"" were on the table in an attempt to right the company's course. The bank this month ended product-sales goals in retail banking and said it refunded $2.6 million to customers for any fees related to potentially unapproved credit-card and deposit accounts.Buried underneath all of the discussion of the scandal, however, was a solid quarter. Earnings per share of $1.03 topped views for $1.01 on revenue of $22.33 billion, above estimates for $22.2 billion.""The other businesses that drive this company performed quite well in the quarter, and we're excited about their growth,"" Sloan said.Community banking revenue edged up 1% to $12.4 billion. Wholesale banking revenue dipped 2% to $7.1 billion. Wealth and investment management revenue climbed 5% to $4.1 billion.The trends in Wells' underlying business were similar to Q2, Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told IBD: Low interest rates offset by loan growth; healthy credit quality; weakness in its energy portfolio that could subside as oil prices rebound.Strong bond trading, meanwhile, lifted JPMorgan and Citigroup.JPMorgan's Q3 EPS of $1.58 topped views for $1.39, while revenue of $25.51 billion also beat. Markets and investor services revenue jumped 20.5% to $6.5 billion, with fixed-income market revenue up 48%. Investment banking revenue rose 6% to $2.9 billion.Citigroup's Q3 EPS of $1.24 beat views for $1.15, while revenue of $17.76 billion topped estimates for $17.34 billion. Fixed income revenue jumped 35% to $3.47 billion. Markets and securities revenue climbed 11.6% to $4.53 billion.Citigroup last month noted better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking.Next week, Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) all report earnings.Those banks could also face questions about their sales staffs' practices in attempting to get more consumers to buy more diverse products. Wells Fargo said its shift to a more service-oriented model could take some time and that conditions could get worse before they get better.""What will it look like?"" Stemm wondered. ""How will they measure the deepening of client relationships?""RELATED:Where Do Millennials Bank? JPMorgan Says It Beats BofA, Wells FargoCitigroup, Like BofA, Sets Sights Abroad, But Q3 View Mixed

Ulta said only one-tenth of its online sales come from online-only shoppers, meaning that most still manage to find a way into a brick-and-mortar Ulta store, even if they're able to order items online. That may explain why Ulta is Amazon-resistant.Ulta Beauty shares soared 11% on Thursday, rebounding above their 50-day line for the first time since August, when Ulta gave slightly cautious earnings guidance.Delta Air Lines (DAL) forecast improved unit revenue for the fourth quarter and tighter capacity growth in 2017, while suggesting it would take a closer look at ways to compete internationally with low-cost carriers in Europe.

Shares plunged 25% the next day, to a five-month low. That follows big warnings on Q3 2015 and Q1 2016. Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro didn't help Illumina's cause when he said that after speaking with Illumina executives, they were ""still searching for answers to explain the miss."" He said a delayedsale of its high-end HiSeq X5 or X10 genome-sequencing system, likely to a China customer was one reason. These systems can cost $1 million-plus, so the sales cycles are long, often longer than expected. U.S. sales of the company's 2500/4000 line also drove the miss, says Massaro, who calls the weak U.S. outlook ""troubling.""The aluminum giant's Q3 EPS rose 52% to 32 cents, missing forecasts by 3 cents, as revenue dipped 6% to $5.21 billion, below expectations for $5.31 billion.

""As a result of (the Nov. 2) announcement, we believe that as long as we continue to see at least 150,000 jobs created a month, the Fed will raise the target Fed Funds rate from 0.25% to 0.50% on Dec. 14,"" noted Bryce Doty, senior vice president and senior portfolio manager of Sit Fixed Income Advisors, in a recent report.But before that, the U.S. election is bound to cause some episodic volatility, said BlackRock's Stournaras. ""It may disrupt the trajectory of the market, but I don't think there's going to be lasting impact so long as there's not a shock in the election.""That said, many experts believe the stock market is quite fully valued. Jerome Dodson, founder and president of Parnassus Investments and portfolio manager of the $1.9 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX), says that he wouldn't expect big gains going forward. But, ""that doesn't mean that I'm going to cash as even the market that's fully valued can still go higher.""Endeavor recently had about 16% of its assets in cash, but that resulted mostly from a buildup new cash inflow from investors and likely to be worked down soon, Dodson says.
"
400,WFC,"Dodson's methodology is to select companies where the stock price still has the potential to move higher and get those at about one-third off the intrinsic value. ""We try to focus on individual companies, because even if the market as a whole is fully valued, there's still isolated bargains lying around here and there.""IBD's TAKE: Looking for the right time to stocks held by top fund managers? See if their stocks are ripe for swing trading.One of the names in the financial sector he likes is Wells Fargo (WFC). The bank's fake-account scandal, which sent the stock down nearly 14% from its high at the end of August, is not expected to affect its capital return plans overall, as per the bank's new CEO Tim Sloan.""Despite this mistake, we still think it's a socially responsible bank and we still like it,"" said Dodson. The stock is currently trading at about 45 and Dodson's target price is just above 70.American Express (AXP) is another example of a company whose beaten-up stock provided a perfect opportunity to get in at a discount. The credit card issuer lost a long-standing Costco (COST) contract for its card, which amounted close to 20% of its business.""The P/E ratio for American Express right now is 11. It's been as high as 18 in the last three years,"" pointed out Dodson. ""But it has a very good return on equity: 25%"" The stock gapped up over 5.5% on Oct. 20 after the company's Q3 earnings and revenue beat analyst forecasts. It is now trading at around 65. Dodson's target over the next three years is 90.High-dividend yielding stocks are not an area where future outperformance will come from, says BlackRock's Stournaras. ""Yielding stocks or 'bond proxies' are extremely expensive by historical standards, primarily driven by a dearth of yield and a scarcity of income in the marketplace.""He expects better earnings growth to come from the nonyielding areas of the equity market. That's where fundamental strength will matter more than dividend yields.Jon Christensen, portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management and co-manager of $410 million Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth Fund (PSGAX) looks for ""very high-quality businesses that will outgrow their markets over long and multiple economic cycles.""He looks for businesses with sustainable competitive advantage, high cash flow, little debt and lower fixed/higher variable cost.Aspen Technology (AZPN), which the fund added to its portfolio early this year, provides software solutions for mission-critical process optimization in the energy, chemical, construction and engineering industries.""We like companies that become very embedded within their customers' processes and manufacturing and infrastructure,"" said Christensen. ""When you become very embedded with a customer, it creates a very high switching cost.""The company generates 46% operating margins, it has very little debt and generates free cash in excess of earnings, he added.RELATED:Cautious Investors Focused On Sturdy Secular Trends In SeptemberWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

401,WFC,"California, the nation's largest issuer of municipal bonds, is barring Wells Fargo (WFC) from underwriting state debt, as well as handling its banking transactions and investments after the company admitted to opening millions of bogus customer accounts.The suspension, in effect immediately, will remain in place for 12 months, State Treasurer John Chiang said Wednesday. ""Complete and permanent severance"" between his office and the bank will occur if it doesn't change its practices, he said.""Wells Fargo's fleecing of its customers by opening fraudulent accounts for the purpose of extracting millions in illegal fees demonstrates, at best, a reckless lack of institutional control and, at worst, a culture which actively promotes wanton greed,"" the treasurer said in a statement.The move by California is the latest to punish the bank, which is facing a national furor over the fraudulent accounts. San Francisco, the home of Wells Fargo, last week removed it from a banking program for low-income residents.IBD'S TAKE: Scandal is never good for a stock, and Wells Fargo is no exception. Since news broke Sept. 8 of the company's admission that its employees created phony accounts, shares have fallen from near 50 to about 45. Wells is ranked 10th in IBD's Banks and Money Center Group. Tops on the list is Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO).The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo $185 million on Sept. 8 for potentially opening about 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts without authorization. Wells' chief executive, John Stumpf, has forfeited $41 million in pay.Also, federal prosecutors in New York and San Francisco have opened criminal inquiries, a person familiar with the matter has said. Wells Fargo already faces a raft of lawsuits by fired or demoted workers, as well as by customers and investors.The loss of work with California will further hurt. Chiang, a Democrat who's running for governor in 2018, oversees about $2 trillion in banking transactions a year and manages a $75 billion investment pool. The bank served as the lead underwriter of five of the past 13 bond offerings from the state this year.Wells Fargo was the second-largest underwriter of municipal debt in California in the first half of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm, which trailed Citigroup (C), handled sales of $3.9 billion in securities, or 11% of total issuance.The bank ranked fifth in overall municipal-bond underwriting this year through June, selling $13.7 billion in debt, for 5.9% market share.

402,WFC,"U.S. stocks kept to a narrow range Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's latest minutes revealed increasing support for an interest-rake hike.The Nasdaq eased 0.1%, while staying near its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% each. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow are stuck under their 50-day lines.Volume in the stock market today fell on both major exchanges. Recently, losses have come in rising volume, while gains have come in declining volume. That's the opposite of what bulls like to see.The Dow Jones utility average was a top performer Wednesday, rising 1%. Given the chatter about an interest rate hike, the gain in the utility average was unexpected. (Higher interest rates make dividend-paying utilities less attractive.) From a wider perspective, some kind of rebound was no surprise. The utility average has retreated about 11% since its July 6 high.Consolidated Edison (ED) has dropped 11% off its high. The stock rose almost 1%, after falling in 12 of the previous 13 sessions. PPL (PPL) also bounced 1% higher, but it remains 18% off its high. The electric utility has skidded in 10 of the previous 11 sessions.Banks, which are likely to benefit from higher rates, made no dramatic moves Wednesday. Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were nearly flat. Citigroup (C) trimmed 0.5%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a Phoenix-based midcap, advanced 0.6%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, dairy products and gold and silver miners booked the best gains for the day, according to preliminary data. Biotechs took the hardest hit.Blue chips were almost even between winners and losers. Dow components Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) led with gains of about 1%.In the S&P 500, Kroger (KR) grabbed the pole position with a 3% pop. A recent Morgan Stanley report said Kroger's alternative formats have not been fully priced into the stock. Rumors also have swirled over a possible merger with Whole Foods Market (WFM).The Fed minutes from the September meeting showed three members favoring an immediate rate hike. They lost the argument, but may have set the tone for a rate hike in December.IBD'S TAKE: An uptrend under pressure makes buying stocks more risky than ideal, but some stocks could be setting up for breakouts.Railway CSX (CSX) reported quarterly results after the close. CSX fell 1% in regular trading Wednesday, its fourth daily loss in a row, and was slightly higher in extended trading. The Street's consensus estimate was for earnings of 45 cents a share, but the number came in at 48 cents.

404,WFC,"Most stock ETFs wafted higher Friday as investors kept a close eye on the beleaguered financial industry.Notwithstanding this week's woes for the CEOs of Wells Fargo (WFC) and Deutsche Bank (DB), the financial sector led the day's gains in the S&P 500.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, tacked on a 0.8% gain on the stock market today.The $197.3 billion SPY ETF eked out a 0.1% weekly gain, finishing the month of September basically flat. It rose 3.8% in the third quarter to take its 2016 gain to 7.7%.SPY now sits 2% below the all-time high of 219.60 it made in August.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) popped 1.4% Friday but posted a mild weekly loss. The ETF slumped hard on Thursday after banks came under fire amid disclosures about phantom accounts at Wells Fargo and  reports that hedge funds are reducing exposure to the embattled German lender Deutsche Bank.Shares of Deutsche Bank listed in the U.S. have been brutalized over the past year and fell to a record low on Thursday, but rallied 14.0% Friday. Shares of Wells Fargo hit a fresh 52-week low Friday.IBD'S TAKE: As Deutsche Bank crumbles, learn more about which bank stocks could be buying opportunities.For the week, energy was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, up 4.4%.

"
405,WFC,"Strength in JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) second-quarter results -- particularly in trading and loan growth -- could bode well for rivals like Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), analysts say.But low interest rates could continue to weigh on net interest margins, even as JPMorgan tries to compensate through loan growth.What's more, banks' underwriting standards differ. While JPMorgan has tried harder to target higher-quality borrowers, analysts will likely be on the lookout for any signs of cracks in consumer credit from other banks as delinquencies in auto loans and credit cards creep up.""What I'll be watching closely is the credit quality side,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said. ""Is there evidence that others are seeing some credit deterioration, which might point to the fact that JPM's credit quality is just better, or are you just seeing it stay fairly pristine across the board?""Shares closed up 1.5% in the stock market today. The other big banks followed, with investors hoping JPMorgan's results could lend some insight into the broader economy. Bank of America rose 1.6%. Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report quarterly results on Friday, climbed 2.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Morgan Stanley added 3.1%, and Goldman Sachs gained 2.9%.IBD'S TAKE: While banks face the prospect of low interest rates for an even longer period, top lenders like Citigroup and JPMorgan may get more generous with capital returns to shareholders.JPMorgan's earnings per share edged up unexpectedly to $1.55 in the second quarter, the company said Thursday, far better than analyst expectations for a 7% drop to $1.43. Revenue rose 2% to $24.38 billion. Adjusted revenue of $25.21 billion was above views for $24.16 billion.JPMorgan's gains were led by consumer loans and trading revenue. Total loans grew by 11% on gains in its mortgage banking, credit cards and auto-lending segments.Trading revenue rose 23%, with fixed-income revenues jumping 35%, in part on gains in currencies, emerging markets and ""better market conditions.""The surge in fixed-income, currency and commodities-trading revenue ""should be a positive read across to BAC and C due to their relative strength in macro products,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a report.Firming oil and bond prices likely also helped boost results. While the bank said it was too soon to forecast what it will do in response to the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, Brexit-related market swings may have played a small part to help trading.""Volatility can sometimes be good and sometimes be bad for trading,"" Stemm said. ""It can be very good for trading when sentiment bounces back quickly, which is exactly what happened with Brexit.""And after years of financial-crisis-induced expenses associated with litigation, JPMorgan booked a $430 million benefit from legal expenses during the quarter.However, advisory fees were flat during the quarter, while equity underwriting revenue dropped 37% as global uncertainty spooked more companies out of merging or going public.And JPMorgan's Q2 net-interest margin -- the difference between interest a bank pays out and takes in -- widened to 2.13% from 2% a year ago. But the metric fell from 2.17% in Q1. The Federal Reserve's decision to lay off more-aggressive interest-rate hikes, amid concerns about economic growth, has strained banks' net interest margins.CEO Jamie Dimon said in the company's earnings release that ""outside of energy, both wholesale and consumer credit quality remained very good."" However, the company's provision for credit losses -- the money that banks reserve as a cushion to guard against bad loans -- jumped roughly 50% to $1.4 billion.""Nothing there was concerning to us,"" Stemm said of the extra money set aside. Much of that money, she said, was set aside for the debt-ridden oil and gas sector or expected credit-card losses that generally come as that market grows and matures.But she added that the low levels of credit and loan losses that banks have enjoyed in the past may be approaching an end.""On the flip side, we'll definitely admit credit quality can't get much better than it is today,"" she said.
"
406,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said second-quarter profit fell 1.4 percent, beating analysts' estimates as fixed-income trading revenue and loan growth jumped.Net income dropped to $6.2 billion, or $1.55 a share, from $6.29 billion, or $1.54, a year earlier, the New York-based company said Thursday in a statement. Excluding an accounting adjustment and a legal benefit, earnings were $1.46 a share, 3 cents higher than analysts' average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. JPMorgan shares advanced 2.3 percent to $64.61 at 7:42 a.m. in New York.Revenue climbed 2.8 percent to $25.2 billion, beating the $24.5 billion average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company said average core loans increased 16 percent from a year earlier. The revenue figure included $3.96 billion from fixed-income trading, a 35 percent increase, beating the $3.57 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equity trading rose 1.5 percent to $1.6 billion.JPMorgan kicks off earnings season for U.S. banks, and may offer insight into the industry's prospects for trading and advisory operations after the U.K.'s surprise vote last month to leave the European Union. While JPMorgan executives have said trading rebounded in April and May, that was before the referendum roiled markets and pushed out expectations for additional U.S. interest-rate increases to at least next year. The delay would extend a post-financial-crisis era of low rates that's forced banks to rely on expense cuts to cope with stagnant revenue.IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan shares have retaken their 200-day and 50-day moving averages this week, but it's not at a proper buy point. Investors also should focus on stocks with Composite Ratings closer to a best-possible 99. But with earnings continuing to fall, JPMorgan's Composite Rating is just 36. See IBD Stock Checkup for a complete JPM scorecard. Bank stocks plummeted after the vote and yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record, draining financial firms of interest income. JPMorgan, which lost about 10 percent in the two days after the June 23 referendum, has since recovered most of that decline.""We saw strong underlying performance with record consumer deposits, credit-card sales volume, merchant processing volume and broad core loan growth"" fueled by mortgages and commercial real estate, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the statement.Non-interest expenses fell 6 percent to $13.6 billion on cost cutting and lower legal bills, the bank said. That compared with analysts' $14 billion estimate.Earnings at the corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, climbed 6.5 percent to $2.49 billion as revenue rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier. Markets revenue, which includes bond and stock trading, rose 23 percent. In June, Pinto said that trading revenue in the quarter was headed for a mid-teens percentage increase from a year earlier on strength in fixed income, especially rates trading.Investment banking revenue fell 15 percent to $1.5 billion on lower equity-underwriting fees. The figure was in line with analysts' $1.49 billion estimate.Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are scheduled to report results Friday, while Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are due next week. Analysts estimate the industry will post its fourth-straight profit decline in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The group saw profits fall 12 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.

Amazon fell 0.75% to 742.63 on the stock market today, still close to recent record highs.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, a long-time Leaderboard stock, is now extended from buy areas, so investors shouldn't chase after the stock until it forms another proper entry point.

Its shares rose 3.3% to 48.53, but off intraday highs of 51.25.The stock has been bobbing around its 50-day moving average for several months, most recently breaking support at the key level last Friday.Kite Pharma soared Wednesday morning after the FDA lifted a hold on a clinical trial of a leukemia drug on rival CAR-T firm Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Juno stock rose 9.5% to 30.42 after reaching 35 in the morning. The trial halt last week, followed some patient deaths, slammed Juno and hurt Kite as well.

410,WFC,"U.S. stocks stumbled Monday ahead of the first presidential debate, closing near session lows as oil prices rose and banking issues fell.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all shed about 0.9%. Conservative investments did somewhat better with the Dow Jones Utility Average inched down 0.25%.Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges as the major indexes headed toward their third session in a row of declining volume.The stock market faces two uncertainties that might be encouraging fund managers to stand back.The presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton is scheduled for 9 p.m. ET. Any surprises at the two-candidate debate could move the market one way or another. Polls show both candidates are intensely disliked. Their populist impulses have left Libertarian Gary Johnson positioned to grab potentially the biggest third party vote since 1996, when businessman Ross Perot was also excluded from the debates but got 8% of the vote. And Green Party candidate Jill Stein threatens to roil conditions further.Why should candidates with little chance of winning matter to investors? A strong third party vote can create uncertainty in otherwise safe states, complicating the electoral college outlook for the major parties. And the stock market hates uncertainty.Economic data also could shake the Street. The final take on second quarter GDP is expected to be released Thursday before the market's open. The Street expects GDP to come in at 1.3% vs. the prior readings of 1.1% and 1.2%. The range of estimates for the final number run from 1.1% to 1.5%, according to Econoday. The GDP number could affect the outlook on interest rates.IBD'S TAKE: Doubts surrounding both the presidential campaign and the final GDP figure are keeping some money on the sidelines.Meanwhile, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil settled at $45.93 Monday, up $1.45, or 3.3%. Oil prices and oil stocks rose as top producers offered concessions to cap output ahead of an informal meeting in Algiers on Wednesday.U.S. oil and gas explorer stocks led the day's big gainers. Texas-based Concho Resources (CXO) popped 1.2% in weak volume as the big cap tried to retake its 50-day line. Texas-based Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) added 1.5% in above-average volume and then reversed to a small gain; the stock is about 35% above its 50-day line. Oklahoma-based Continental Resources (CLR) advanced 0.5% in below-average volume as it battled to reclaim its 50-day line.Among blue chips, Wells Fargo (WFC) tried to find support near the 45 level, an area that provided support in February and June. This is an especially crucial support area in the light of recent scandals. Still, Wells Fargo shares fell 1.9% to 44.88, its first below 45 since February 2014.Wells Fargo is accused of opening 2 million accounts without customer approval in 2011-15, while big bank stocks in general retreated Monday on Fed proposals to raise capital levels.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder.

He also will not get a 2016 bonus. Carrie Tolstedt, who had been retail banking chief during the abuses, has left Wells Fargo -- ahead of her planned year-end exit. She also will surrender $19 million in stock awards and will not get any severance or a 2016 bonus.""These initial actions will not preclude additional steps being taken with respect to Mr. Stumpf, Ms. Tolstedt or other executives as a consequence of the information developed in the investigation,"" Wells Fargo's independent directors said.Wells Fargo likely wanted to take some action before Stumpf returns to Capitol Hill Thursday for another grilling, this time by a House panel.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve this week said it wants Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and other top banks to hold more capital. That will boost financial stability but reduce bank profitability.Last week Senate lawmakers harshly criticized Stumpf and Wells Fargo for firing 5,300 employees for creating millions of unauthorized customer accounts over several years, but not holding any top executives accountable. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for Stumpf to resign.The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier Tuesday that Wells Fargo was mulling various clawback measures.Wells Fargo shares rose 0.5% to 45.09 on the stock market today.

414,WFC,"Shares of Deutsche Bank (DB) jumped after Agence-France Presse reported that the embattled German banking giant was close to settling a U.S. mortgage-securities case for $5.4 billion -- potentially far less than the $14 billion the Justice Department initially sought.The news came amid growing concerns about whether the bank would wind up crippled after the settlement as well as broader economic problems and political upheaval in Europe that have strained the region's banks.Bloomberg reported yesterday that a handful of hedge funds had cut their positions in the bank. While concerns have grown that Deutsche Bank's problems could ripple across the global financial system, analysts have cautioned against comparisons to a Lehman-Brothers-esque catastrophe.Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares jumped 14% to close at 13.09 in the stock market today, nearing their 50-day line. Shares have tumbled over the past year, and concerns about the bank have weighed on markets in recent days.U.S. banks followed. JPMorgan (JPM) rose 1.4%, while Bank of America (BAC) added 3.2% and Citigroup (C) gained 3.1%. All moved back above their 50-day lines, a key test of investor support.Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.5%, and Morgan Stanley (MS) climbed 3.3%. But Wells Fargo (WFC), whose CEO over the past two weeks has become a congressional punching bag over the bank's cross-selling scandal, dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: As Deutsche Bank rebounds, learn more about which bank stocks could be buying opportunities.Earlier in the day, Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan, in a letter to employees, touted the bank's fundamentals in an attempt to soothe anxieties about ""unjustified concerns"" regarding the bank.""It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business,"" he wrote. ""Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust.""Cryan added that the bank had more than 20 million clients and more than 215 billion euros (around $241 billion) in liquidity reserves, which an analyst said was among the bank's less-depressing characteristics.""Deutsche has many business-model issues but liquidity is not an issue,"" Guy Moszkowski, director of research at Autonomous Research, said over email.By comparison, Morgan Stanley, whose annual revenue was in the same range as Deutsche's, had a global liquidity reserve of $207 billion at the end of Q2. Morgan said that metric was composed of ""highly liquid and diversified cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered securities.""Cryan, in the letter, also said that the bank meets all capital requirements, and that its capital ratio would be further helped by the offloading of British insurer Abbey Life and the pending sale of its holdings in China's Hua Xia Bank.Some analysts had anticipated the settlement would be negotiated down from the $14 billion first proposed by the DOJ.""While we expect the US DOJ (residential mortgage-backed securities) case to be settled well below the ($14 billion) first claimed, the uncertainty is an overhang and in any case we think litigation will remain a strong drain on capital generation through 2017,"" Credit Suisse said in a recent research note.RELATED:Deutsche Bank Is No Lehman, But Big U.S. Bank Stocks Break Support

415,WFC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) late Friday applied to the Federal Reserve for permission to expand its stake beyond 10% in Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire disclosed in March it had reached the 10% threshold. None of the other top-four U.S. lending banks have a single investor with an investment the size of Berkshire's stake in Wells Fargo, according to Bloomberg.""Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,"" Berkshire said in Friday's filing. ""Berkshire does not have any specific transaction or dollar value in mind with respect to any such potential purchases.""Wells Fargo is among Berkshire's four top stock holdings, which also include American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and IBM (IBM).But Wells Fargo has struggled this year and reported a 5% drop in earnings per share last quarter. It's projected to see EPS shrink in both this quarter and the next.Wells Fargo's capital plan also received approval earlier this week from the Fed. But the lender hasn't announced any changes to its dividend or buyback plans, while peers like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have OK'd massive returns to shareholders.Wells Fargo shares edged up less than 0.1% in late trading, after closing down 0.6% at 47. Its stock price has dropped 15% so far this year. Berkshire closed down 0.6% at 143.99 Friday.

416,WFC,"The big banks' earnings should suffer further when second-quarter results come out this week, but potential highlights include stronger mortgage revenues for Wells Fargo (WFC) and a better trading environment for Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), analysts say.Still, Wall Street will be focused on the quarters to come, with Brexit and extended low interest rates potentially weighing on results over at least the rest of the year.JPMorgan kicks off earnings season for the banks, with its quarterly results set to be reported on Thursday. Analysts see the bank reporting earnings per share of $1.43, down 7% from a year earlier, with revenue down 1.5% to $24.1 billion. Trading and loan growth are expected to help the bank, but competition in the credit-card business could weigh on results, Credit Suisse said in a report Monday.Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo report on Friday. Analysts expect Citigroup's EPS to slide 27% to $1.10, with revenue falling 8.5% to $17.5 billion. Wells Fargo's EPS is seen edging down 1.9% to $1.01, with revenue rising 4% to around $22.2 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Ahead of the earnings reports, legendary investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sought regulatory permission to boost its stake in this bank above 10%.The results will come after JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank (DB) last week warned that the U.K.'s vote last month to eventually leave the European Union could curb the industry's fee income and access to financial markets across the bloc. M&A dealmaking had already suffered leading up to the vote, according to Mergermarket.""We believe the largest driver of stock performance at earnings will be any forward-looking comments that could help shine light on future investment banking and trading activity, or additional expenses, post the Brexit vote,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note last week.A formal U.K. separation from the EU could also hurt finance-industry profits and prompt banks to cut or relocate thousands of jobs. Executives from Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan met with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne last week to discuss ways to keep London's financial reputation intact.And with the vote to exit the EU heightening global economic uncertainty, the Fed is unlikely to raise the benchmark interest rate anytime this year. That, along with other economic indicators, will likely strain banks' full-year net interest margins, the difference between interest banks take in from loans and what they pay to depositors, Fitch said in a statement Monday. Revenue is also likely to suffer, it added.But Brexit-related trading volatility may have been an opportunity for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs during the quarter, Credit Suisse said in a separate report Monday.""A rebound in credit markets (2Q16 was the best quarter for credit market asset prices since 2009) and elevated trading activity in and around Brexit should drive solid sequential quarter growth in trading revenues and profits,"" according to the firm.The other big banks report next week. Bank of America reports results next Monday. Wall Street expects EPS to fall 27% to 33 cents, with revenue down 8% to $20.5 billion. Credit Suisse also expects better trading results and loan and deposit growth for the bank.Goldman Sachs, which reports next Tuesday, is expected to report Q2 earnings per share of 3.02, a 53% jump from a year earlier, with revenue down 16% to $7.6 billion. Analysts expect Morgan Stanley's Q2 earnings per share to drop 24% to 60 cents on revenue down 13% to $8.3 billion. Morgan reports results next Wednesday.Bank stocks rose in the stock market today. JPMorgan edged up 0.7%, Bank of America 0.3%, Citigroup 0.7%, Wells Fargo 0.6%, Morgan Stanley 0.5% and Goldman Sachs 1.2%.
"
417,WFC,"Technology giants in the S&P 500 are expected to turn in their worst earnings drop since the recession, dragged down by falling sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone.Overall, S&P 500 earnings in the second quarter will fall 4.7% vs. a year earlier, the fourth straight quarterly decline, according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenues are expected to dip 0.9%, the sixth straight quarterly slide.Technology earnings are expected to decline 6% from a year earlier, worse than the 4% fall in Q1, according to Thomson Reuters. Tech revenue should slide 4.8%. But excluding Apple, tech profits should dip just 1%, with revenue off 2.5%.Apple's earnings per share are seen falling 24.9%, as revenue tumbles $7.6 billion from a year earlier to $42 billion. Apple revenue fell 13% in the prior quarter, the first drop in more than decade.Apple's revenue drop will more than offset a combined $5 billion pop from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). Google parent Alphabet is expected to report a 15.2% rise in earnings as revenue grows by $3 billion, or 17.0%, to $20.7 billion. Facebook's earnings are forecast to expand 62%, as revenue surges by just under $2 billion, or 48.5%.Despite Apple's ongoing slump, the stock has recently shown flickers of life, moving back above its 50-day moving average. But it's still in a yearlong downtrend.Facebook rose 1.2% on Friday, retaking a 117.09 entry point, but in below-average trade. Alphabet is close to retaking its 50-day but is much nearer its highs than Apple is.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook was just one of many notable breakouts Friday, with General Electric and Lowe's among those clearing entry points. Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) are expected to see earnings declines of 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Weaker iPhone sales won't just hit Apple, but its suppliers too: Skyworks (SWKS) is seen reporting a 9.7% drop in earnings, as revenue falls 7.4% to $750 million.S&P 500 energy earnings are expected to tumble 78.5%, though that's better than Q1's outright loss.The energy sector is ""the main drag,"" but not the only one, Thomson Reuters analyst Greg Harrison told IBD. Six of 10 S&P 500 sectors tracked by the data provider are expected to show negative earnings growth.S&P 500 earnings excluding energy are on tap to fall 0.8%, the first drop in several years, after a scant 0.4% Q1 rise. Revenue should climb 2.1%.Companies tend to beat profit views by a few percentage points overall, so non-energy earnings likely will show a gain.Overall earnings and revenue are expected to return to growth in the current third quarter, as energy companies face easier comparisons.Stock markets typically rally ahead of a profit recovery, as investors anticipate stronger results. The current bull market began in March 2009, months before corporate results bounced back. But sustained profit declines usually occur during a recession -- such as the 2007-2009 slump. Not this time. And while stocks have been choppy for months, they've generally moved sideways to slightly higher.Also, the earnings upturn for the S&P 500, packed with corporate titans with heavy overseas exposure, is looking somewhat less certain after the U.K.'s Brexit vote sent interest rates sliding and boosted the value of the dollar.S&P consumer staples earnings rose 1.5% in the first quarter, but they are expected to slip 1.7% in the second quarter. Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings will likely show a 5.6% earnings decline amid flat revenue. Wal-Mart is continuing to face margin pressures after boosting its base wage to $10 an hour in February.After falling for nearly all of 2015, Wal-Mart shares have gradually recovered, rising last week to their best levels since July 2015.Financials have been another laggard, with sector earnings expected to fall 5.4% after a 10.4% tumble in the first quarter. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is expected to see a 6.5% earnings drop as revenues dip 1.7%. Earnings for Wells Fargo (WFC) are seen off a more modest 3.3%. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (C) are due to report Q2 results in the coming week.Low interest rates have eroded the spread between the interest they can charge borrowers and what they have to pay depositors, and the further drop in borrowing costs since Brexit could mean more of the same in the current quarter.Shares of JPMorgan and other major banks remain far off their highs.Earnings in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to lead the way, rising 8.8% in the quarter. The sector includes Amazon (AMZN), which is projected to have another knockout quarter. The online retail giant and web-services provider is seen posting a 27.4% revenue boost. Amazon earnings should soar to $1.10 a share from 19 cents a year earlier.Amazon shares are at all-time highs after finding support at the 50-day line amid the post-Brexit vote sell-off.The other sectors expected to see positive earnings are health care (up 4.5%); industrials (3.1%) and utilities (1.6%). Health care demand tends to rise steadily, while domestic-focused utilities are shielded from overseas turmoil.Industrials like General Electric (GE) received something of a reprieve from the strong dollar in the second quarter, but that appears at risk of reversing in the third quarter after the U.K. vote to leave the European Union sent the dollar higher.Still, General Electric shares hit an eight-year high on Friday, closing at 32.20, just over a 32.15 buy point.Brexit isn't expected to have much of a direct impact on earnings in the near term, with the U.K. and Europe accounting for about 1% and 7% of S&P 500 revenue, respectively, Thomson Reuters' Harrison said.Yet, indirect effects from the stronger dollar and lower interest rates will be a factor. Earnings estimates for the third quarter have come down just ""a tad bit"" since Brexit, Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.""We'll begin to learn the full extent (of the impact) in coming days and weeks as companies share their outlook on earnings calls,"" he added.
"
418,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are expected to boost shareholder returns at a faster pace than investment banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), top regional banks, and credit card giant Capital One (COF).As investors await the next round of stress-test results Wednesday night, CLSA estimated in a recent report that returns through buybacks and dividends from JPMorgan, BofA, Citi and Wells Fargo could potentially rise to $51 billion over the next year, or nearly two-thirds of earnings, and continue increasing through 2020.The bump in capital return for the big money-center banks would follow their attempts to shore up capital, which helped them pass the first round of annual stress tests last week.In fact, all 33 banks tested passed that round, which quantifies whether banks' capital reserves would meet the Fed's minimum required levels in difficult economic conditions -- including 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries in this year's doomsday scenario. Citigroup led the charge in the improved capital levels.""This reinforces our view that the money center banks offer the greatest upside potential for capital return when capital plans are announced next Wednesday,"" Buckingham Research analyst Jim Mitchell wrote in a research note released Friday.In the second of those two rounds, also known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve determines whether banks could reasonably deliver planned dividend and buyback increases amid financial strain.Buckingham Research, in a note Friday, said the odds were low that big banks of particular significance to the economy would have their plans rejected by the Fed. Similarly, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note on Thursday that most banks that it covers ""appear well positioned to meet our capital return expectations.""""Overall, we believe that stress test results are most positive for (Citigroup), (Bank of America), and Morgan Stanley -- where meaningful increases in capital returns are projected -- but the whole group should benefit if investors view the stress test as becoming less stressful for Universal Banks longer term,"" KBW said.CLSA, however, warned that from 2013 to 2015, one out of seven banks has had qualitative problems in the second round of the tests, even after performing well on a quantitative level.Bank stocks rallied for a second straight session in the stock market today as they and global markets continue to recover from the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. JPMorgan rose 2.8% while Bank of America climbed 3.9% and Citigroup 4.15%. Wells Fargo tacked on 1.9%, Morgan Stanley 2.5% and Goldman Sachs (GS) 2.2%.
"
419,WFC,"Among investors in the largest U.S. companies, no pay package is less popular than the one given to Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares.Only 23% of the shares of the housewares retailer were voted in support of its compensation plan at an annual meeting on July 1, the lowest level in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shareholders told the board that the CEO's $19.4 million pay for 2015 was too high, and that his performance goals weren't challenging enough, the Union, N.J.-based company said in its May proxy statement.New York Comptroller Scott Stringer, representing city pension funds, weighed in on the matter with a letter to Bed, Bath & Beyond investors. There's a ""gaping and persistent disconnect between CEO pay and company performance,"" he wrote. The retirement funds, with $160 billion in assets, are among the company's 60 largest shareholders.Bed, Bath & Beyond, which sells everything from coffee to accent rugs, is reducing Temares' target compensation by 14% for 2016 and is making his performance goals more rigorous, according to its proxy statement. Janet Barth, a spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing.Shareholder disapproval of Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay practices contrasts with a falling number of businesses that fail in so-called say-on-pay votes. About 1% of S&P 500 companies have lost in their most recent nonbinding votes, and the average support level is 93%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Temares' 2015 package was his largest ever, even as shares fell by more than a third. His pay tops that awarded to Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) CEO John Stumpf and approaches that given to IBM's (IBM) Virginia Rometty. The awards include a $4 million salary and $15.7 million in stock and options. That was an increase of about $1.1 million from his 2014 package. The exact amount of stock that 57-year-old Temares will receive may change depending on how Bed, Bath & Beyond performs against a group of 47 other companies on earnings and return-on-capital measures.A University of Pennsylvania law graduate who primarily worked in real estate, Temares joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in 1992 before its debut on public exchanges to oversee property transactions as it expanded. Its footprint has grown to more than 1,500 stores from 62 two decades ago. He was promoted to CEO in 2003, earning a $931,000 salary during his first year in the top job.Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay plan also failed with investors last year. The company determined it would make some changes after contacting 25 investors representing 68% of shares, the chain said in the May 31 proxy.Temares' target compensation was reduced to $16.9 million for 2016 in a plan that will be voted on next year. His $4 million salary, the third-largest in the S&P index, will stay the same. He receives the large salary in lieu of a smaller one and a potential bonus, because ""cash bonuses promote short-term thinking,"" according to the filing.Still, Institutional Shareholder Services describes the CEO's salary as ""excessive"" and notes that it could bloat his golden parachute to $46 million if the company gets bought. The proxy adviser gave Bed, Bath & Beyond a rating of 10, its worst governance score, meaning its structure may have a greater probability of risks to its reputation, long-term value or fiduciary obligations.Bed, Bath & Beyond is joined by car-parts maker BorgWarner (BWA), chemical producer FMC Corp. (FMC), mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP), and utilities owner Exelon (EXC) in receiving less than 50% support in its most recent vote. Representatives of Exelon and BorgWarner said the companies take the votes seriously and are seeking investor feedback. The other companies didn't return requests for comment.In addition to Bed, Bath & Beyond, only Oracle (ORCL) has received less than 50% support in two consecutive years. The Redwood City, Calif.-based software maker is on its fourth failed year. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment.Stringer noted Bed, Bath & Beyond's compensation committee members Dean Adler, Stanley Barshay and Victoria Morrison have each served on the board for more than 13 years, which ""highlights the need for new directors that are able to exercise strong, independent oversight of management."" Each received about 65% support after calls by Stringer and ISS to oust them. The committee doesn't have a chair, which is rare.

421,WFC,"Banks retreated Thursday, testing buy points as Treasury yields fell ahead of earnings from Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) out Friday.Treasury yields were down Thursday after a weaker-than-expected trade report out of China sent investors toward government bonds and other safe assets. Investors have bid financials in recent weeks on the prospect of Federal Reserve rate hikes and the recent rise of long-term yields around the world. JPMorgan fell 0.6% to 67.74 on the stock market today after dropping as low as 66.82, just above the 50-day line. The stock is still in range from a buy point of 65.08, cleared in early August.JPMorgan is expected to report a 17% drop in third-quarter earnings but revenue is seen rising 2% to $23.988 billion when it announces quarterly results Friday.Citigroup shares dipped 0.5% to 48.47 after sinking intraday to 47.54, below a recent 48.24 buy point. Analysts see Citi's Q3 EPS falling 15% on Friday to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344 billion. Wells Fargo shares slid 1.3% to 44.75 well below its 50-day and 200-day lines.

425,WFC,"With JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday, the landscape for the big banks has enough in common with what we saw in Q2.In other words, the Fed still opted not to raise interest rates, hurting the banks' net interest margins. The state of the U.S. consumer remained generally solid. And the global ""economic uncertainty?"" That was still there too.""During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The only good news some analysts see is no bad news.""Unfortunately, the positive might come in just not having any negatives,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said.But Citigroup last month cited better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking, while JPMorgan remained upbeat on the economy and the state of the consumer.Other factors will be likely to dominate the financial world's attention. Many observers will likely be cued into any commentary surrounding Wells Fargo's cross-selling scandal — in which authorities said the bank's employees created as many as 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to hit sales targets.The scandal has cost John Stumpf his job as CEO and chairman. The bank said late Wednesday COO Tim Sloan is taking over as CEO and Stephen Sanger is taking over as chair.The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank outlined plans to rebound from the scandal during a conference call on Monday. Details from those plans could be presented on Friday.The scandal over the bank's cross-selling, a point of pride for management only a few years ago, led to some intense questioning from Congress about the bank's culture and executives' knowledge of the sales practices. The financial impact during Q3, however, was limited.Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's earnings per share to fall 4% to $1.01. Revenue is seen rising 1.5% to $22.2 billion.""The investment community's going to be looking for some specifics from the management team on what they're going to do to adjust sales practices, and what's that going to look like from a cost standpoint?"" Stemm said.""And then I think there will be follow-ons to some of the other banks, too – 'What do your sales practices look like? What are you doing to monitor both risky behavior?' What does that look like for future compliance costs?""Beyond cross-selling, KBW expects Wells' net interest margins to be constrained, even after the bank grew loans considerably in quarters past.JPMorgan, another bank KBW said was dependent on loan growth after activity rose rapidly in recent quarters, is expected to report EPS down 17% to $1.39.The bank's equity markets could be a bright spot, KBW said. Revenue is expected to climb 2% to $23.988 billion.Citigroup's EPS, meanwhile, is expected to fall 15% to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344.Citigroup in June also acquired Costco's (COST) U.S. co-brand credit-card portfolio from American Express (AXP). Citi and Costco announced their co-branded credit-card deal last March.""(Q3) will be the first full quarter with Costco in the numbers and management has already indicated that the performance within the Costco portfolio is exceeding management's expectations,"" Kleinhanzl wrote. ""If Citi can show material growth in receivables from the Costco portfolio then we would expect shares of Citigroup to do well at earnings.""KBW also said Citigroup may have gotten more of a bump from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. But the bank has said that investment banking during the quarter was ""lighter than estimated.""JPMorgan dipped 0.3% in the stock market today, while Citigroup lost 0.6% and Wells Fargo eased 0.3%. Bank of America (BAC) fell 0.5%. Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 0.8%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) added 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis.

426,WFC,"Bank stocks have rallied in recent weeks as the Fed has shown more openness to raising interest rates. Other factors could extend their gains, Morgan Stanley notes.That uptrend for the banks ""could continue if oil prices edge higher, inflation picks up, Yellen raises rates, corporates re-engage,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a research note. ""Risks include a divided government post-election, weak C&I growth, and political backlash.""Other risks for the banks include commercial lending, which KBW expects to weaken after the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union caused businesses to put plans on hold, which in turn meant less borrowing.Bank of America reports Monday, Goldman reports next Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley reports on Wednesday.IBD's money center banking industry group, where most of the major banks are, was ranked 131st out of 197 groups on Tuesday. It has been in the bottom half of the table for many months.RELATED:U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain Embrace

427,WFC,"Treasuries swung from gains to losses Wednesday as Saudi Arabia's $17.5 billion bond sale -- the largest ever from an emerging-market nation -- weighed on U.S. sovereign debt.Benchmark yields fluctuated as Saudi Arabia sold the dollar-denominated bonds, with proceeds to go toward shoring up finances battered by a slide in oil prices. The deal came as companies including Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Mondelez International (MDLZ) sell debt, putting U.S. corporate bond sales on track for their busiest week in a month, with issuance set to top $25 billion.""Any time you see a big new issuer coming in, there's a potential for crowding out,"" said George Goncalves, head of U.S. interest-rates research at Nomura Securities, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. ""It doesn't help the Treasury market, that's for sure.""Treasuries have slumped in October as a bond-market gauge of inflation expectations has climbed to the highest since May. In a speech at a Boston Fed conference last week, Chair Janet Yellen laid out the argument for keeping monetary policy easy while hinting at letting the economy run hot. Traders see policy tightening this year as an odds-on proposition, even if markets are also pricing in a gradual pace of future increases.Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 1.74% as of 4:25 p.m. ET, after declining six basis points over the previous two days, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.5% security due in August 2026 was 97-26/32.The Saudi offering eclipsed Argentina's $16.5 billion sale in April as the largest ever from a developing nation. It followed a week of presentations to prospective buyers at which officials emphasized the kingdom's efforts to diversify the $650 billion economy away from oil.In addition to potentially luring away U.S. debt investors seeking higher yields, heavy corporate and sovereign issuance can weigh on Treasuries through the mechanics of how bonds are sold. Issuers of dollar-denominated debt often enter into what's known as rate-lock agreements, in which they bet on Treasury prices falling to guard against higher yields. Once the debt is sold, the wagers are ended.The probability of a U.S. rate increase by December is about 63%, fed fund futures indicate. The calculations assume that the effective fed funds rate will average 0.625% after the next increase. Swaps trading implies the rate will be about 0.65% in a year, and 0.77% in two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The U.S. economy maintained a steady growth pace between late August and early October, as a tight labor market with nascent wage pressures contributed to a ""mostly positive"" outlook, according to the Fed's latest Beige Book, an economic survey by reserve banks.The gap between yields on five- and 30-year debt, a gauge of the yield curve, was about 1.28 percentage points, near the highest since June.Traders await the European Central Bank's policy-setting meeting Thursday for signals about its monetary stimulus efforts. Most economists in a Bloomberg survey predict it will prolong its 1.7 trillion euro ($1.9 trillion) bond-buying program in December and won't start to taper its asset purchases before the second half of 2017.""There aren't going to be any significant changes tomorrow,"" said David Keeble, New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole. ""Without the taper talk, I think longer-dated bonds will do pretty well.""

428,WFC,"Morgan Stanley (MS) reported much-better-than-expected third-quarter earnings Wednesday as fixed-income trading revenue almost tripled, the biggest surge for that business on Wall Street.Earnings per share rose 69% to $1.02 a share, the U.S. investment bank said. Net income rose 57% to $1.6 billion.Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 58, has sought to convince investors he can lower costs while steadying profit from bond trading, a business that weighed on returns in the past. Gorman said in June that the fixed-income and commodities business is capable of generating $4 billion in annual revenue even after being scaled back, which included a decision to cut 25% of the division's staff last year.""Our expense initiatives remain on track,"" Gorman said in the statement. ""Overall the results reflect steady progress against our long-term strategic goals.""Fixed-income trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $1 billion. Equity trading climbed 5.6% to $1.9 billion, compared with the estimate of $1.83 billion.Companywide revenue rose 15% to $8.91 billion, exceeding the $8.14 billion estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Morgan Stanley rose 1.2% to 32.70 before the opening bell on the stock market today.

430,WFC,"FB Financial (FBK), the holding company for regional bank FirstBank, and Bermuda-based Bank of N.T. Butterfield (NTB) rose in their debuts after pricing their initial public offerings late Thursday.That follows regional bank First Hawaiian (FHB), which has rallied since its IPO debut last month.The recent crop of successful bank IPOs comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting next week and amid speculation over when the central bank might decide to raise interest rates. It also comes as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) this week touted its success with millennials, and Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) showcased their international potential.Worries of a rate hike have weighed on the broader market. But a benchmark rate increase from the Fed would prompt banks to raise their own interest rates, potentially boosting net interest margins that have lagged amid the central bank's caution on a hike. Higher interest rates, however, also risk hurting borrowing and consumer spending. And it's hard for bank stocks to power ahead in a generally sluggish market.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week bluntly urged: ""Let's just raise rates,"" saying the economy was in decent shape, and Fed officials have in recent weeks seemed more open to the idea of a rate hike. In August, Fed chair Janet Yellen said ""the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months.""But Lael Brainard of the Fed's Board of Governors on Monday signaled that she would prefer to wait. The odds of a hike next week or in November are slim. There is about a 53% chance of at least one move by the December meeting.FB Financial, which is profitable, climbed 9.2% to 20.75 in the stock market today. The Nashville-based company, which serves Tennessee and parts of Alabama and Georgia, had priced its IPO at 19. Earlier this month, the firm said it was selling 5,882,352 shares of its common stock with a price range of 16-18 per share.""The market area has attractive economic, population, and household income growth statistics that provide a favorable business environment,"" the company said in an SEC filing. ""We believe that the strong economic growth in our market area has created a favorable operating environment for us.""Q2 profit rose 42% vs. a year earlier.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have rallied on more bullish remarks from Fed officials.

431,WFC,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone demand appears higher than conservative forecasts, giving Apple and the broader markets a lift. Wells Fargo (WFC) is still reeling from the major cross-selling fraud scandal. General Motors (GM) said its Chevy Bolt will have a higher battery range than the Tesla Motors (TSLA) Model 3, as Tesla and others gave autonomous vehicle updates. Two huge agribusiness mergers were announced.The major averages followed the Sept. 9 sell-off with several large and up-and-down days. Fed Gov. Lael Brainard's dovish comments Monday helped reassure investors that a September rate hike was highly unlikely. Meanwhile, Apple powered ahead on stronger-than-expected demand for its iPhone 7. Apple, which boasts the world's biggest market cap, is part of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day line and rose 2.3% for the week. The S&P 500 and Dow, up 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, remained below that key support level.Apple started selling its 10th-generation smartphone, the iPhone 7, on Friday along with its second-generation smartwatch, Apple Watch Series 2. AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) said iPhone preorders were better than for last year's iPhone 6S, while Verizon (VZ) said they were in the normal range for an iPhone launch. Apple said it sold out its initial production run of iPhone 7 Plus and jet-black color iPhone 7 handsets. Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones because of battery fires could help Apple gain smartphone market share, analysts said.Apple rose 11.4% to 114.92, its best weekly gain in years and blasting past a 110.33 buy point on Wednesday.August retail sales fell 0.3% and industrial production sank 0.4%, both worse than expected. But struggling apparel stores, groceries and restaurants reported higher sales. September's Philly Fed manufacturing index jumped far more than expected, while the New York Fed's Empire State index remaining negative. But the most important economic news may have come Monday, when Federal Gov. Lael Brainard signaled she would prefer to be cautious with rate hikes. That reinforced expectations that the central bank will take no action at this week's policy meeting.Wells Fargo shares continued to slide over the cross-selling fraud scandal, losing nearly 7% for the week. After paying a $195 million fine and firing 5,300 workers, Wells reportedly faces a federal criminal probe. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank (DB) tumbled 9.4% Friday after the Justice Department said it wanted $14 billion to settle a probe into its mortgage securities from 2005-2007.""Let's just raise rates,"" JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said during the week, following more bullish sentiment from Fed officials over a potential rate hike that would likely boost banks' finances. At the Barclays Global Financial Services conference, Bank of America (BAC) said Q3 investment banking had improved, while the quarter so far for Citigroup (C) appeared more mixed. Both touted their international prospects.Intel expects third-quarter revenue of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion vs. its prior range of $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion.

433,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) on Monday urged the Federal Reserve to ""just raise rates"" and touted its popularity with mobile-oriented millennials.JPMorgan argued in a presentation that it is outperforming rivals in attracting millennials, with more from that generation gravitating toward its Chase checking, savings or credit-card accounts than toward Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).The bank's attempt to position itself as the top choice for millennials, who now outnumber baby boomers, comes as big financial institutions try to offer more mobile services to tap the spending of an increasingly smartphone-oriented portion of the population that manages more of its money online.""Millennials make up the majority of our new deposit customers, and we lead competitors in primary relationships with millennials,"" according to slides accompanying a presentation given at the Barclays Global Financial Services conference.Fifty-seven percent of Chase's recent checking-account acquisitions have come from the millennial population, Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer & Community Banking, said in the presentation.Twenty-two percent of millennials preferred Chase as their primary financial institution for checking and savings accounts, compared to 19% with Bank of America and 14% with Wells Fargo, the presentation said, citing research that TNS Retail Banking Monitor conducted from Q2 2015 to Q1 2016. The figures and rankings were similar for credit-card accounts. Active mobile users had risen 18% during the first half of the year.Smith's presentation materials also said mobile payment services like Apple (AAPL) Pay had yet to fully take off but added that Chase wanted to be ""wherever our consumers want to spend.""He also remained upbeat on the economy, adding he was ""not seeing customers taking on excessive levels of debt"" and that he was not concerned about a slight rise in credit-card 30-day delinquencies and net charge-offs.

435,WFC,"JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon expressed doubt about the U.K.'s ability to sell financial services freely after the nation voted to leave the European Union, and Deutsche Bank (DB) warned that the Brexit would hurt banks' revenue. But industry executives said they'd work to keep London a major world financial hub.""If we have that passport after Brexit, we likely would not have to make any change at all,"" Dimon told the Il Sole 24 Ore, a media outlet based in Italy, according to Bloomberg.Financial ""passporting"" allows banks with operations in the U.K. to more easily do business with the rest of the European Union.""But I think the European Union will not accept that,"" Dimon continued. ""It will put more conditions on the U.K. and might force banks to become smaller in London.""JPMorgan shares rose 0.65% to 60.58 in the stock market today. Shares of the big banks have struggled to reclaim their 50-day and 200-day lines, as well as the ground they lost following the Brexit vote late last month.IBD'S TAKE: Despite fears of Brexit fallout hitting banks' results, the Fed's latest stress tests showed top lenders like JPMorgan can weather a severe economic downturn and still return billions of dollars in capital to shareholders.While Dimon said he hoped a formal separation from the EU might not happen -- the vote was technically non-binding -- he added that the bank could shift ""a few thousand"" employees to other areas if the impact from the separation got too difficult to deal with, Bloomberg said.What the financial terrain would look like if the U.K. did leave the EU is unclear, but the pound plunged to 30-year lows amid the economic uncertainly created by the vote. Analysts have worried that a decision to leave the bloc would gouge banks' profits, hurt housing prices and force banks to move employees out of London.Meanwhile, executives from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Bloomberg said.They issued a statement saying they would work together ""to help London retain its position as the leading international financial center.""Bank of America shares rose 1.2%, Morgan Stanley added 2.2%, and Goldman Sachs edged up 1%.Deutsche Bank also warned of ""a smaller fee pool"" and ""a lot of uncertainty"" for the banks following the vote, according to Bloomberg.Even before the vote, merger activity suffered in the U.K. amid the uncertainty.

437,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) and 27 other banks passed the first round of Federal Reserve stress tests on Thursday, despite losses of $526 billion forecast in the central bank's most dire economic scenario.Investors will now turn their attention to the second round of stress-test results, which the Fed releases Wednesday. Wall Street tends to focus more on that round, as the Fed determines whether the banks' requests for bigger dividends and stock buybacks are reasonable given the impact the firms would sustain under the test scenarios.The Fed said the 33 banks tested this year would sustain $385 billion in loan losses under the 2016 test circumstances, which include a sharp drop in housing prices, 10% unemployment and negative rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries, a notable difference from the tests last year. Consumer loans accounted for 52% of forecast loan losses among the banks, the Fed said.The Fed also noted that its hypothetical conditions were softer on investment banks' profits, but that the negative short-term interest rates were harder hit by the negative rates.""As compared to last year's severely adverse scenario, firms that are active in trading and market activities saw smaller losses in net income as a result of less severe stress in the equity markets, but firms more focused on traditional lending activities were more affected by negative short-term interest rates and greater stress in the real economy,"" the Fed said.Analysts largely expected the banks to get through the first round unscathed, although the Fed could still reject their capital plans next week.Among major banks, Citi came out with the highest Tier 1 common capital ratio -- a way of quantifying banks' most durable assets and the most-watched metric for the tests -- at a 9.2% minimum in the Fed's darkest scenario. Morgan Stanley had 9.1%, Goldman Sachs 8.4%, JPMorgan 8.3%, BofA 8.1% and Wells Fargo 7.2%. The Fed requires at least 5% to pass.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) came closest to falling short, with a ratio of 5%.JPMorgan rose 1% after hours on the stock market today, Bank of America added 1.7% and Citigroup gained 2.7%, and Wells Fargo edged up 0.6%.

439,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS), once the most profitable firm on Wall Street, reported a 47% increase in third-quarter earnings as revenue from bond trading surpassed analysts' predictions.Net income rose to $2.09 billion, or $4.88 a share, from $1.43 billion, or $2.90, a year earlier, the New York-based company said in a statement Tuesday.Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 62, has cut jobs, given responsibility to more junior employees and lowered compensation to reduce expenses and preserve flexibility to ramp up trading when activity returned. This quarter shows the benefit of the strategy, which attracted some skepticism among analysts as competitors such as Morgan Stanley (MS) decided to retreat instead.""We saw solid performance across the franchise that helped counter typical seasonal weakness,"" Blankfein said in the statement.Fixed-income trading revenue rose to $1.96 billion, beating the $1.7 billion estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equities-trading revenue of $1.78 billion surpassed the $1.69 billion estimate. The sales-and-trading division is overseen by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan.The bank is battling sluggish revenue prospects and trying to show investors it can generate a return on equity above its cost of capital after years of returns often in excess of 20 percent were the envy of the industry.Goldman Sachs enacted at least four rounds of job reductions in New York this year that accounted for more than 400 dismissals. It also extended cuts in its fixed-income division to roughly 10% of staff, double what it normally culls each year, and eliminated dozens of managing directors, executive directors and vice presidents across the mergers and debt and equity capital-markets teams.In recent weeks, Goldman Sachs has reduced its projection for job cuts in Asia. The firm now intends to trim about 15% of its investment-banking jobs in Asia outside Japan, fewer than the 25%, or 75 positions, initially considered last month, a person with knowledge of the matter said Monday.The company has also sought to develop new businesses to help generate revenue and boost returns. The bank this month began offering loans through its online-lending platform Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which offers unsecured consumer loans to creditworthy borrowers. It also has an online deposit-taking franchise that it purchased from General Electric (GE). this year. Consumers can open a savings account there with as little as $1.Goldman Sachs's stock slumped 6.2% this year through Monday, lagging behind the 0.2% drop for the S&P 500 Financials Index.Goldman Sachs is the fifth of the six biggest U.S. banks to report results, with Morgan Stanley set to announce earnings on Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) kicked off the U.S. financial industry's earnings season Friday, topping analysts' profit estimates on a 48% surge in fixed-income trading. Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) surpassed predictions, too, as fixed-income revenue jumped 35% and 39%, respectively. Wells Fargo (WFC), contending with a scandal in its consumer business, also beat estimates.

443,WFC,"Even as the Federal Reserve signals that tougher standards lie ahead for its annual stress tests, banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC) and others could still get more generous with their payouts as the tests become more routine, analysts suggest.After the Fed approved 31 of 33 bank capital plans late Wednesday, JPMorgan announced a $10.6 billion buyback, Bank of America OK'd a $5 billion repurchase and a 50% payout increase, and Citigroup unveiled a $8.6 billion buyback and more than tripled its dividend. Morgan Stanley (MS) hiked its dividend 33% and announced a $3.5 billion buyback.The results ""highlight the capital strength that enabled the sector to broadly increase payout requests,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement Thursday, later adding that banks are ""becoming increasingly comfortable with the annual process.""As massive as the shareholder returns unveiled Wednesday were, there appears to be room for more among giants like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, based on the ratio of dividends and buybacks vs. earnings expected over the next year.Comerica (CMA) and M&T Bank (MTB) lead banks with net payout ratios of 119% each, followed by Morgan Stanley at 105%, according to Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's is 73%, while the ratio for both Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) is 65%, Citigroup's is 63%, and Bank of America's is 49%.Shares of Morgan Stanley climbed 3% on the stock market today. JPMorgan added 1.5%. Bank of America and Citigroup rose 0.6%. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.1%.Even before the stress test results came out, analysts have been expecting the banks to get more aggressive with shareholder returns after finally emerging from the aftereffects of the financial crisis.A CLSA note this month said JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are likely to hand out a bigger chunk of profits over the next four years, meaning greater gains for investors who stuck with them through lean times.Portales Partners this month said it expects banks ""to get more creative in their capital return requests, as the companies are becoming more familiar with the process"" of submitting capital plans for the stress tests, as well as resubmitting them if the Fed has any concerns with risk assessment or whether banks' dividend and buyback plans could overburden their finances if the economy falters.But even as banks push the envelope on capital returns and become more accustomed to the yearly drill of visualizing their state of affairs in an economic crisis, the Fed has warned of potentially stricter capital requirements in future tests.""The Fed noted that, despite general progress, banks still need to improve internal controls around various elements of capital planning,"" Fitch said.

JPMorgan (JPM) approved a $10.6 billion buyback while keeping its dividend the same. Bank of America (BAC) declared a $5 billion share repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents.

445,WFC,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

447,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC) is reportedly set to eliminate as many as 8,000 retail banking jobs to cut costs, as fewer people go to brick-and-mortar banks and more use digital media to transfer funds, pay bills and other banking tasks, a report said Wednesday.The top U.S. bank by deposits also plans to hire an unspecified number of sales staff, including loan officers, small-business bankers and personal investment advisers, the Financial Times reported, citing knowledgeable sources.However, the number of new hires at Bank of America isn't expected to be near the number the Charlotte, N.C., bank plans to let go via attrition and layoffs, the report said, so even with those new hires, a net loss of thousands of employees is expected. Bank of America shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today. After reporting double- and triple-digit profit growth every quarter in 2015, the bank reported a 22% year-over-year drop in earnings per share last quarter, and analyst consensus is for an 18% decline this quarter.It joins other banks that have cut staff to lower costs. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan Chase (JPM) planned to lay off 100 from its private banking operations. Bloomberg earlier this month said Goldman Sachs (GS) cut dozens of management positions. Deutsche Bank (DB), Barclays (BCS) and others have also reported layoffs or were reportedly preparing to do so.Bank of America is in the Banks-Money Center group, which is ranked a weak 168 on IBD's list of 197 industries.

It rallied on positive iPhone 7 orders from wireless carrier Sprint (S), which said that pre-orders in the first three days were quadruple vs. the same time a year ago.Apple shares are getting closer toward a potential breakout past a 110.33 entry in a cup-with-handle formation. The stock is also trying to end a more-than-yearlong trend of lower price highs and lower lows.Wells Fargo (WFC) dived more than 2% to 47.31 in heavy turnover on reports that the mortgage-selling bank has eliminated sales goals for its retail banking staff. On Friday, the stock slumped below its long-term 200-day moving average near 49.50 in heavy volume, suggesting a long-term downtrend remains intact.The slide in banking shares also comes one day after Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard urged prudence in deciding when to kick off another rise in short-term interest rates. Her comments flew in the face of other leaders at the U.S. central bank who over the past week expressed reasons for a modest hike in the cost of money.Near-zero interest rates have depressed net interest margins for lenders across the country.The S&P 500 sank 1.2% while the Dow Jones industrials fell almost 1.1%.

Fed policymakers Esther George, Loretta Mester and Eric Rosengren voted against the move, wishing instead to raise the rate to a range of o.50% to 0.75%.While that statement said that the U.S. economy had gained momentum from the first half of the year, they expect that the economy will ""evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.""The statement added that ""the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.""RELATED:Sen. Warren: Wells Fargo CEO Should Resign, Face Criminal ProbeWhere Do Millennials Bank? JPMorgan Says It Beats BofA, Wells Fargo 
"
451,WFC,"Wells Fargo's (WFC) John Stumpf should resign, give back his compensation and face criminal prosecution for a scandal in which the bank opened unauthorized accounts for thousands of customers, Senator Elizabeth Warren said.""So you haven't resigned, you haven't returned a single nickel of your personal earnings, you haven't fired a single senior executive,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said Tuesday as the bank's chief executive officer testified before the Senate Banking Committee.""Instead, evidently your definition of accountable is to push the blame to your low-level employees who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves,"" Warren said. ""It's gutless leadership.""Wells Fargo agreed to pay a record $185 million to authorities including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after a review found employees may have opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without consumers' permission. Stumpf, 63, told lawmakers he was ""deeply sorry"" and detailed a five-year timeline of attempts the bank made to deter misconduct.Warren told Stumpf he should ""give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.""The lender is also contacting all of its customers nationwide to ensure their accounts and credit cards are products they need and want, said Stumpf, who is also the bank's chairman.""The Wells Fargo board is actively engaged in this issue,"" Stumpf said. ""The board has the tools to hold senior management accountable, including me and Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of our retail banking business. Any board actions taken with our named executive officers will be appropriately disclosed, and I want to be clear on this, I will respect and accept the decision of the board.""Stumpf is under political pressure to punish senior managers, such as calls by Warren to claw back millions of dollars in pay from Tolstedt.The bank had announced in July that Tolstedt was retiring. On Monday, it said Claudia Russ Anderson, who had overseen risk in the retail banking unit, is taking a six-month unpaid leave for personal reasons.""Carrie chose to retire,"" Stumpf said, adding that he and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan told her the bank wanted ""to go in a different direction."" She was eligible for retirement ""and she decided to retire"" after that conversation, Stumpf said.Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, told the CEO that the bank's response has been inadequate, and said, for example, that Wells Fargo hasn't yet calculated what effect lower credit scores resulting from the fake accounts might have had on customers' finances. Senior management downplayed the importance of the problem and continued to award performance bonuses to those involved as recently as two months ago, Brown said.""You would think the lessons of the financial crisis, which came at such a high cost to our country, would change the way banks do business,"" Brown said.Other witnesses Tuesday include U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Tom Curry, who said in prepared remarks that he's directing bank examiners to review sales practices at all ""large and midsize banks,"" and that the agency could pursue its own enforcement action against people at Wells Fargo. CFPB Director Richard Cordray also was scheduled to speak.Stumpf, who testified with a bandaged right hand the firm said he injured while playing with his grandchildren, provided a timeline of the bank's own investigation into the matter. In 2011, a dedicated team began to monitor and root out improper sales. The firm started terminating roughly 1,000 of its 100,000 retail banking employees annually for violations. By 2012, the lender began lowering some sales goals for compensation.In 2015, an OCC review of Wells Fargo's sales practices revealed shortcomings that prompted the agency to demand changes -- including telling the bank to compensate customers for any harm suffered. The company had to bring in an outside consultant, Curry said. Wells Fargo hired PricewaterhouseCoopers in August 2015 to help determine whether customers were hurt, according to Stumpf.The CEO outlined other ways Wells Fargo has tried to prevent unauthorized accounts from being created, including working with regulators and creating a new branch compliance program.A group of Democratic Senators, led by Warren, last week wrote a letter pressing Stumpf with questions on pay. The lawmakers singled out Tolstedt, writing that there appears ""to be multiple grounds on which to trigger the clawback provisions to recoup some or all of Ms. Tolstedt's incentive rewards.""The House Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Jeb Hensarling, said last week it also plans to conduct its own investigation and will hold a separate hearing later this month. Hensarling, a Texas Republican, said he plans to request that Stumpf appear for that hearing, too. Tolstedt as well as other corporate officers will be called for transcribed interviews, the lawmaker said.

452,WFC,"Banks haven't delivered much bang for the buck in the past year, and are trying ETF investors' patience some more.The financial sector crumbled to the bottom of the S&P 500 heap Friday after Brexit -- the U.K.'s exit from the European Union -- came to pass. That plunge came on the heels of upbeat news for Wall Street banks: Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo (WFC) and 27 other banks passed the first round of Federal Reserve stress tests, an annual rite of passage that puts them through the wringer.All 33 banks showed they could absorb serious market shocks and maintain their capital cushions even in a ""hypothetical firestorm of 10% unemployment, negative interest rates, deflation, etc.,"" said S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Erik OjaNow financial companies are being seriously challenged on another front. The Brexit result will likely create several headwinds for U.S. banks, according to Oja.""We now see a further decline in long-term U.S. interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar, and low probability that the Fed will raise short-term rates in the foreseeable future,"" he wrote Friday. ""This will further pressure net interest margins at banks, and lead to lower oil prices -- with negative credit effects on banks' energy lending.""The importance of the financial sector to investors can hardly be overstated. It accounts for roughly 15% of the S&P 500. The impact of its policies ripple across from American households to mom-and-pop shops to giant U.S. corporates.Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Global's director of exchange traded funds research, concurs that the Brexit news is sobering for this key sector.""We think financial ETFs with hefty exposure to banks will be negatively impacted,"" he said in an email. As examples, Rosenbluth cites the bellwether Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and iShares U.S. Financials (IYF).XLF sank nearly 5% on the stock market as investors digested the Brexit result. Year to date through June 23, XLF was down 1.1% for the worst performance of any S&P sector.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has risen 4.5%.Banks got beat up as the Federal Reserve kept Americans guessing about its next rate move. In December, the Fed hiked interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. This year, it has waffled about the timing of the next increase. Banks benefit from higher interest rates, which boost their net profit margins.SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) and SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) have slumped  4.0% and 2.3% respectively so far in 2016.A more gloomy rate outlook post-Brexit could spell trouble for regional banks. Although the largest banks did surprisingly well in the latest stress tests, regional banks did not fare as well, Oja wrote.""They had a difficult test with negative interest rates,"" he added. Still, market watchers point out that U.S. banks overall are on solid footing.The heavyweights, in particular, have strong capital positions and solid balance sheets. ""The money center banks are probably in the best capital shape that they have been since the financial crisis started in 2008,"" Charles Peabody of Portales Partners, a broker dealer, wrote in a June 8 note. The firm expects this banking group to be a major source of dividends and buybacks for shareholders this year and next.At BlackRock, strategists expect the UK's divorce from the Europe Union to trigger a long period of political, economic and market uncertainty.They said: ""We see the vote leading to declines in global shares and other risk assets. Yet indiscriminate selling could translate into opportunities. U.S. and Asia markets are only marginally affected by the U.K.'s exit from the EU, and are supported by a mix of easy monetary policy and economic growth.""The immediate negative reaction to the news is exactly what ETF strategists at CLS Investments are homing in on. Both U.S. financial and Europe financial ETFs are looking attractive to CIO Rusty Vanneman.""We're looking to buy,"" Vanneman told Investor's Business Daily on Friday. The firm has been a better buyer of financials in 2016, moving from an underweight to overweight position in the sector. ""Our plan is to get to an overweight, and this sell-off will provide an opportunity for us to add to those positions,"" he added.He finds iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN) particularly attractive from a valuation standpoint given the recent drubbing for the likes of HSBC (HSBC), Credit Suisse (CS) and Deutsche Bank (DB).
"
453,WFC,"The U.K.'s surprising and historic decision to leave the European Union overshadowed all other news this week, roiling global markets and raising doubts about the European economy and post-war order.But it was a busy week for business news. In a well-timed release, the Federal Reserve said JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other giant banks passed their ""stress test"" scenarios. Elon Musk's bid to merge Tesla Motors (TSLA) and SolarCity (SCTY) raised doubts, even among long-time devotees. Wal-Mart (WMT) and JD.com (JD) teamed up. Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT) and FedEx (FDX) gave weak guidance, and the Federal Aviation Administration finalized drone regulations.Gloom overtook world markets after Britons voted to leave the EU amid a wave of nationalist sentiment. The vote will begin a long process of negotiations to determine what parts of the existing business landscape will stay or go for a range of industries that operate in the region. JPMorgan Chase, American Airlines (AAL) and their global peers were hit hard. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said he would step down, while right-wing populists elsewhere on the Continent called for similar referendums in their nations, potentially expanding financial and cultural fissures within the bloc. The Federal Reserve said it is ""prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary,"" but questions remained about how much left was in its arsenal to ward off any coming market turmoil.U.S. stocks had rallied through Thursday, in large part because polls got it wrong and predicted that the U.K. would stay in the EU. Stocks suffered huge losses Friday after the Brexit results pushing the major averages into the red. The Nasdaq lost 1.9% for the week while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed off 1.6%. European markets suffered deeper losses. Big losers included carriers such American Air, while Tesla Motors tumbled on its ill-received SolarCity bid. Treasury yields hit four-year lows. The dollar skyrocketed vs. the pound but tumbled vs. the yen.Tesla made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Analyst reviews of the deal hit a negative tone, calling it a fundamental change to Tesla's business model that could thwart its aggressive efforts to expand production of its all-electric vehicles and add to cash flow and financing concerns. Tesla shares tumbled 10.45% on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss since May 2014. Tesla  fell 10.4% for the week. SolarCity initially spiked on the deal, but closed up just 4.1% as investors doubt a deal will happen. Musk, the top shareholder of both companies, said he won't vote on any merger agreement.The Federal Reserve passed all 33 banks -- including majors JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) -- in the first round of its annual stress tests, as expected. Investors will now focus on the second round of results, set for release Wednesday, that will determine whether banks can carry out their submitted plans to return capital to shareholders. But just because banks can weather a storm doesn't mean it will be fun: Bank stocks were among the biggest losers Friday on the Brexit fallout, erasing gains from earlier in the week.Adobe reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share on in-line sales for its fiscal second quarter ended June 3, but investors focused on its disappointing sales guidance for Q3.The maker of digital media and marketing software earned 71 cents a share excluding items, 3 cents above views, on sales of $1.4 billion. It was Adobe's fourth straight quarter of 20% or greater sales growth and its seventh straight quarter of double-digit gains in adjusted EPS.For the current quarter, Adobe is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 72 cents on sales of $1.445 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. Analysts had been modeling 71 cents, up 31%, on sales of $1.47 billion, up 21%.Adobe shares were down 3.55% for the week, undercutting a buy area.Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) announced a deal to buy an 84% stake in mobile video game company Supercell for $8.6 billion. The transaction values the Finnish game developer at $10.2 billion.Helsinki-based Supercell makes free-to-play mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" It makes money by selling virtual goods that help players advance in its games. Supercell's games are played by more than 100 million people each day.Tencent is a leader in online games. It owns ""League of Legends"" maker Riot Games and distributes games in China for Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and others.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced an alliance with China's JD.com (JD), with JD taking ownership of Wal-Mart's Yihaodian marketplace, its China e-commerce business, in return for an approximate 5% stake in JD.com in the form of newly issued shares. The move may help both Wal-Mart and JD compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA).JD.com is the second-largest online retailer in China after Alibaba. Wal-Mart has struggled to build its China business.Wal-Mart rose 1.4%, hitting a 10-month high. JD closed up 2.5% for the week.Twitter (TWTR) expanded its push into machine learning with the acquisition of Magic Pony Technology, a London-based startup that specializes in visual processing.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the price tag was reported to be $150 million.Magic Pony's technology ranges across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscience.Also, Twitter gave its users more room to unleash their creativity, expanding the length of its video play to 140 seconds from 30, as it battles for viewers with the likes of Facebook (FB) photo and video sharing site Instagram, which has now grown to 500 million subscribers.The Twitter change is designed to help video creators boost their audiences and make money in the process.Existing-home sales rose 1.8% in May to an annual rate of 5.53 million, the highest in nine years, the National Association of Realtors said. But new-home sales fell 6% to 551,000, the Commerce Department said. April new-home sales were revised down sharply to 586,000 from the initial reading of 619,000. Tight supply has limited purchases of new dwellings. But homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell 18,000 in the week ended June 18 to 259,000, the Labor Department said. That was a bigger drop than expected, and put the total back near a 43-year low set in March. It's a good sign for the June employment report after May's surprisingly weak payrolls gain.The Transportation Department and FAA finalized regulations for the commercial use of drones, which officials say could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy over the next 10 years. The rules are seen as less restrictive than expected. Under the new regulations, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within the pilot's line of sight and cannot be operated at night, but those restrictions could be lifted under a waiver. Among the publicly traded companies impacted by the new rules are Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart, GoPro (GPRO) and AeroVironment (AVAV).Red Hat reported fiscal Q1 revenue and billings slightly above views, as well as in-line earnings. But it forecast full-year profit that was a bit light, citing a new planned acquisition. Some analysts said larger enterprise deals were a bright spot. The open-source Linux software company increased a stock buyback program to $1 billion from its earlier $500 million authorization. Red Hat is expected to update its public cloud strategy at an investor day slated for June 30.Red Hat stock tumbled 4.8% for the week, falling below a recent buy point.FedEx reported strong fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue growth, both topping analyst estimates. But the company forecast adjusted EPS of $11.75-$12.25 for the current fiscal year. The midpoint of $12 was below consensus of $12.05. FedEx also didn't say how its recently acquired European shipper TNT Express would affect results. Shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it issued Q4 results. Shares are off 7.2% this week, undercutting the 200-day line.The No. 2 U.S. package shipper plans to spend about $5.1 billion this year for ongoing expansion of the FedEx Ground network, as well as for planned aircraft purchases to support the FedEx Express fleet modernization program. Rival and No. 1 shipper UPS (UPS) crept out to a 17-month high on Thursday before tumbling Friday to fall less 1% for the week amid the Brexit turmoil on the market.

454,WFC,"Stock futures rallied strongly Thursday, joining a global rally as Britons began voting on whether to stay in the European Union, with the latest polls signaling a shift to remaining in the EU. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big U.S. banks rose ahead of stress test results due out tonight. Meanwhile, Red Hat (RHT) tumbled on weak guidance, while Tesla Motors (TSLA) extended losses on the ill-received plan to buy SolarCity (SCTY).The Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 and Dow industrials futures all signaled roughly 0.9% gains at the opening bell on the stock market today. On Wednesday, stocks erased early gains to close modestly lower. But after the market close, new surveys suggested that U.K. voters were leaning against Brexit. Voting won't end until 5 p.m. ET, with actual results hours after that.European bourses jumped, with the U.K.'s FTSE up 1.4%, France's CAC-40 climbing 2.3%, and Germany's DAX advancing 2.1%. The British pound hit a 2016 high, while oil prices also climbed.U.S. shares of European banks were big winners. Deutsche Bank (DB) rose 6%, while Barclays (BCS) climbed 4%.As for U.S. banks, JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) shares all pointed higher in the premarket.In addition to hopes that the U.K. will remain in the EU, bank investors are expecting positive stress test results. The Federal Reserve will release the first round of tests after the market close, with all 33 major financial firms expected to have sufficient capital cushions. On June 29, the Fed will rule on banks' payout plans for dividends and buybacks.Red Hat fell nearly 6% to 75.27 in premarket trade. The open-source software leader reported in-line earnings late Wednesday but cut its EPS outlook on a new 3scale acquisition. Red Hat broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 76.40 buy point on April 20, but it seemed poised to undercut that level.Tesla Motors fell about 1% in premarket trade to 194.50. That's after tumbling 10.45% on Wednesday, Tesla's worst loss in more than two years. Investors and analysts questioned CEO Elon Musk's plan for Tesla to buy SolarCity. Musk is chairman of the solar installer, which is run by his cousins.SolarCity, which spiked as much as 11% Wednesday, closed up just 3.3% as investors questioned whether the deal will actually happen. Shares dipped 1% early Thursday. 
"
455,WFC,"Median shareholder payout from many of the biggest U.S. banks could rise to as much as 77% of earnings from 68% last year if their dividend-and-buyback plans pass the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, analysts say, with money centers like JPMorgan (JPM) and credit-card banks American Express (AXP) potentially leading the returns.And banks' finances are generally seen holding up when the Federal Reserve on Thursday reports the first results of the tests, in which the Fed analyzes how well 33 banks' capital cushions could absorb shocks to the market and their finances. In the second round of evaluations, released on June 29, the Fed not only evaluates whether banks' finances pass muster amid broader economic turmoil but also whether their plans to return money to shareholders would be justified as a result, potentially restraining their ability to repurchase shares or hike dividends.Those passing grades would come despite a volatile market over the past year, rising consumer debt and tougher testing standards. In January, the Fed asked banks to assess how they would handle an economy with 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. government bonds -- stricter criteria than in years past. Banks responded with their plans in April.But analysts feel that the banks are on solid enough footing today to withstand those rigors -- after Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan had to modify their capital return plans to pass the tests last year.""More broadly, we see limited downside risk given that nearly all of the companies under coverage have seen material improvement in capital ratios"" since the previous tests, Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell said in a note Monday.The big money-center banks -- like JPMorgan, Citigroup, BofA and Wells Fargo -- ""are probably in the best capital shape that they have been since the financial crisis,"" Portales Partners said this month in a research note, which predicted that such banks would turn out the biggest shareholder returns.""I'd be surprised if any of the big four had a big hiccup this year,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Werner told IBD, referring to JPMorgan, Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America.Portales predicted that on average, roughly half of earnings this year and next from those banks would come back to shareholders in the form of buyback programs and dividends.Those increases would be in part driven by low payouts last year and an improved capital buffer, Mitchell said. He also said those big banks would see a bigger payout increase, 20%-44% as measured in dollars, than any other kind of bank Buckingham covers.Credit-card banks like Capital One (COF), Discover (DFS), and American Express (AXP), were also likely to ""enjoy above industry average payouts"" over the next year, Portales said.""It's surprising the credit-card banks have been more resilient, even with the large consumer losses that they predict and that they model,"" Werner said. ""I think the capital levels at those banks have generally been stronger, just because of the nature of the business.""But beyond JPMorgan and the credit-card banks, the picture for potential returns is less clear.On one hand, Buckingham Research said Monday that Morgan Stanley had tremendous potential for ""upside surprise,"" citing in part its move away from volatile fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading. Credit Suisse on Monday also said Morgan was among those best positioned to return a high percentage of its capital.However, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods remained cautious on Morgan, after the bank had to modify its capital plan last year. Portales analyst Paul Gulberg told IBD that investment banks Morgan, along with Goldman Sachs, were more exposed to the U.K.'s potential decision to leave the EU and other world market chaos, and could ""get hurt a little bit.""Coincidentally, the U.K.'s referendum on leaving the EU also takes place Thursday. Analysts have warned that a so-called 'Brexit' could roil the financial landscape in Europe and reverberate into U.S.-based banks. Some U.S. banks detailed what effect Brexit would have on them in their stress-test responses, the Financial Times reported this week.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods has also warned that post-stress-test payouts could be topping out.""Overall, payouts are near the upper end of what we believe is the long-term range of 70% to 80% of earnings over the CCAR cycle for the median bank,"" the firm said in a note last month, referring to the second round of testing, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.Payouts this year could also be affected by proposed adjustments to the stress tests' methodology in the future.Federal Reserve governors this month said some large banks could have to set more money aside to pass stress tests down the road. Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a note that while those new requirements might not take hold until 2018, payout ratios could be affected as soon as this year.""The Fed has done its best to not be so predictable with its models,"" Werner said. ""It sounds like it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game – they don't want to banks gaming the models, but at the same time the banks are trying their best to get a more predictable result.""JPMorgan and Wells Fargo rose about 2% on the stock market today on optimism about the Brexit vote as well as the stress tests. Citigroup climbed more than 4% while Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advanced more than 3%. American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial rose roughly 2%.

457,WFC,"The third quarter could finally be the bottom — after a year of the embattled, oversupplied energy sector pulling earnings of S&P 500 companies into negative terrain.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are forecast to dip 0.5% from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Given that actual results usually top analyst forecasts by a couple of percentage points, this could end a four-quarter earnings decline as the hangover from the oil price crash subsides. Revenue is set to grow 2.6%, ending six quarters of declines.Energy earnings are seen plunging 67%, but that's an improvement from declines of 85% in Q2 and an outright loss in Q1. In Q4, energy earnings are expected to see 3.8% growth as crude prices have rebounded from 12-year lows early this year to above $50 a barrel on Thursday. Leaving out the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are estimated to grow 2.9% in Q3.""The idea is that the worst is behind us,"" said Sheraz Mian, who manages Zacks' equity research department. ""We saw some early tentative signs of improvement in the last earnings season as well, even though growth was in the negative.  . . . But results were nevertheless an improvement over what was expected.""Financials will add a lift, with sector earnings forecast to tick up 1% vs. drops of 4% in Q2 and 12.6% in Q1. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on Friday, Oct. 14. Most banking stocks — with the notable exception of scandal-hit Wells Fargo — have been rallying in recent weeks on expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike.Broadly, the estimates reflect easier comparisons, particularly in energy and materials, whose results have slumped with the price of commodities. And the strong dollar still weighed during the quarter. But it didn't weigh as much as it could have because expectations have dimmed over the year for the Fed to be more aggressive about raising interest rates.Expectations in the months to come — including 8.4% earnings growth for Q4 — are higher but obtainable, Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio said. But while loftier forecasts typically get revised downward as the reporting season advances, earnings are still likely to grow in Q4 and early 2017 despite lingering economic anxiety.""I think the overall sentiment doesn't seem to have this positive outlook,"" he said. ""But when you look into the numbers, they're telling you a very different story.""The tech sector's earnings are expected to grow 4.5% in Q3 and 10.1% excluding Apple (AAPL), Aurelio said, demonstrating the company's weight in the index. In fact, taking Apple out of the S&P 500 overall would result in a slim 0.1% profit gain.But Aurelio pointed to pockets of resilience in the tech sector outside of Apple, which has been bogged down on concerns about slowing iPhone demand.In particular, he likes the odds of the semiconductor equipment segment, whose earnings are expected to grow 61% amid greater demand for technology that provides efficient memory storage. Applied Materials (AMAT) is among the leaders in the group, with earnings seen jumping more than 125% on nearly 40% revenue growth.""It's historically always been a gauge for where things are going, because it's supplying the equipment to make the devices that go into other devices,"" he said. ""It's supplying the equipment to make the chips.""The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of stocks has climbed 50% from a mid-February low to a 16-year closing high Thursday.Elsewhere, there are mixed signals. After posting double-digit-percentage earnings gains over the past year, the consumer discretionary sector is poised to slow to only 4.1% growth, according to Thomson Reuters.The expected slowdown comes largely from the auto industry, in particular Ford (F), with its anticipated 51% drop in earnings. The automaker in July indicated that sales could soon hit their peak, amid concerns about discounts and an auto-loan bubble. Take Ford out of the equation, and consumer discretionary's earnings would grow 7.9%, Aurelio said. General Motors' (GM) earnings should dip 4% after several quarters of more than double-digit gains.Amazon (AMZN), which is included in the consumer discretionary group, is seen doing some heavy lifting for the sector, with earnings growth expected to surge 371% in Q3.Elsewhere in the consumer-facing sector, restaurants across the board have warned of less customer spending, and retailers continue to suffer at the hands of Amazon.The materials sector, forecast to rebound to 7.1% earnings growth after a year of declines, is also seen getting a boost from a single heavy lifter.The section's drive into positive territory was due to the copper sub-industry, Aurelio said. The lone S&P 500 member of that mining subsector is Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose earnings are projected to soar 227%. Excluding Freeport, the materials sector's earnings would decline 0.6%.Labor costs in a variety of businesses — in retail, restaurants and even the airlines — could also mean lower profits. And while the health care sector is often immune to the cycles that hurt other businesses, earnings growth for the space is expected to slow to 5.5%. The sector overall is heading into tougher comparisons after getting a boost from the biotech industry in the past.So just as the shock from the oil bust is finally starting to fade, there's the sense that other big companies are losing momentum.""The growth cycle effectively has run its course for large-cap America as a whole,"" Mian said.Analysts expect industrial firms to report a 1.2% earnings decline, and that likely doesn't reflect Honeywell (HON) news. Honeywell late Thursday cut the top end of its 2016 earnings forecast, citing weak Q3 aerospace sales. Honeywell shares plunged 7.5% Friday, with aerospace customers and rivals also slumping.PPG Industries (PPG), maker of industrial coatings, paints and glass, crashed 8.3% Friday on a Q3 profit warning. Fellow S&P 500 paint component Sherwin-Williams (SHW) retreated 1.9%.

All three indexes were on track for a second straight weekly loss. Volume was lighter across the board vs. the same time Thursday.Building-related stocks, gaming software and solar issues led the upside in today's stock market action. Laggards included department stores, biotechs and gold miners.Banks gave up their early gains despite view-topping results from Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).

But Goldman Sachs (GS) led the Dow with a 2% gain.Oil stocks underperformed too, as West Texas intermediate crude oil settled at $50.35 a barrel, down 9 cents. The U.S. oil rig count rose for a seventh straight week in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes data, and the 15th of the past 16 weeks.On the IBD 50, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) rose 2%, extending a bounce off its 50-day line and back into buy range from a 43.15 flat-base entry. Volume was light, however, and all purchases remain highly risky with the market uptrend under pressure. Oppenheimer began covering the video game maker with an outperform rating and a 53 price target. Also on the 50, New Oriental Education (EDU) gained 3%. After an orderly pullback, shares of the Chinese test prep and language training provider are in buy range from a 45.47 entry.

460,WFC,"John Stumpf, responding to allegations that Wells Fargo (WFC) opened millions of unauthorized accounts, said his bank failed its customers and the American public.In remarks prepared for the Senate Banking Committee, Stumpf said the scandal was not an ""orchestrated effort"" and that the company never wanted employees to open accounts that they didn't need or want.""I am deeply sorry,"" Stumpf said in a copy of his testimony that was obtained by Bloomberg. Stumpf, chairman and chief executive officer, is scheduled to appear before the panel Tuesday in Washington.""I am going to explain this morning what happened and what we have done about it,"" Stumpf said in the prepared remarks. ""Wrongful sales practice behavior goes entirely against our values, ethics and culture.""The San Francisco-based bank agreed earlier this month to pay $185 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators to resolve claims that employees opened more than 2 million accounts that consumers may not have known about. Stumpf is testifying Tuesday before the committee, chaired by Republican Richard Shelby.IBD'S TAKE: Wells Fargo shares rose Monday, but have fallen sharply since the cross-selling revelations. Meanwhile, two bank IPOs had a successful debut on Friday.Other witnesses include U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Tom Curry, who said he's directing bank examiners to review sales practices at all ""large and midsize banks,"" and could pursue its own enforcement action against individuals at Wells Fargo, according to prepared remarks. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray is also scheduled to testify.Stumpf's testimony walks through a timeline of the bank's own investigation into the matter and firing of employees. Efforts to detect and deter unethical conduct were put in place ""out of concerns that some employees were not doing what was right,"" according to Stumpf. Starting in 2011, the bank assigned a dedicated team to monitor and root out sales practice violations. Sales employees began being terminated for misconduct as a result of the investigation. Starting in 2012, the lender began to reduce certain sales goals for compensation.In 2015, an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency review of Wells Fargo's sales practices revealed shortcomings that prompted the agency to demand changes -- including telling the bank to compensate customers for any harm they suffered from bad sales practices, and that the company had to bring in an outside consultant to review what was going on, Curry said. Wells Fargo hired PricewaterhouseCoopers in August 2015 to help determine whether customers incurred financial harm, according to Stumpf.""Despite all those efforts, we did not get it right,"" Stumpf said. ""We should have done more sooner to eliminate unethical conduct and unintended incentives for that conduct to occur. Even one unauthorized account is one too many.""Stumpf also outlined other ways Wells Fargo has tried to prevent unauthorized accounts from being created, including working with regulators and creating a new branch compliance program.Stumpf's testimony isn't likely to quell concerns lawmakers have about what the bank is doing to hold some of its top executives accountable. The remarks don't discuss executive compensation or give any information about whether the board plans to consider clawing back pay for some top managers, including Carrie Tolstedt, the retired executive who led the unit where the alleged misconduct occurred.A group of Democratic Senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, last week wrote a letter to Stumpf asking questions about pay. The lawmakers singled out Tolstedt, writing that there appears ""to be multiple grounds on which to trigger the clawback provisions to recoup some or all of Ms. Tolstedt's incentive rewards.""The OCC, which regulates Wells Fargo, began receiving complaints in 2012 from consumers and employees about ""improper sales practices,"" Curry said. In his remarks, Curry said the agency has started ""a review of individual misconduct and culpability.""The House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Jeb Hensarling, said last week it plans to conduct its own investigation and will hold a separate hearing later this month. Hensarling says he plans to request that Stumpf appear for that hearing too. Tolstedt as well as other corporate officers will be called for transcribed interviews, Hensarling said.

461,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have broken out this week on growing Federal Reserve rate-hike speculation and relief over Deutsche Bank (DB).After AFP reported that Deutsche Bank could settle a mortgage-securities case for far less than the Justice Department asked for, potentially warding off a bigger shock to the global banking industry, Bank of America and Citigroup on Friday bounced off their 50-day lines. Meanwhile, Fed officials' comments and recent economic data have reinforced expectations for central bank tightening by the end of the year.Banks and bank stocks should do well if the Fed raises rates because it allow them to increase the spread between its lending rates and borrowing costs. Banks' net interest margins have been squeezed in recent years.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), meanwhile, also rebounded off its 50-day. JPMorgan broke out in early August from a handle in a consolidation and remains within range of the 66.58 buy point.

On Wednesday, SunTrust rose 2.2% to 45.73, still in range. SunTrust had found resistance several times just above 44 in recent months.Meanwhile, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% to 49.21 Wednesday, extended from buy range but still performing solidly.Wednesday's bank stock gains come as ADP reported that companies added 154,000 jobs in September, short of estimates for 170,000 but still solid. Meanwhile, the ISM nonmanufacturing index shot up to an 11-month high last month. On Monday, ISM's manufacturing index signaled a return to factory expansion.RELATED:New High Analysis: Session Yields Slew Of Financial BreakoutsU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain EmbraceJPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Waver As Rates To Stay Lower For Longer

But Rosengren had long been considered a policy dove. His comments raised the odds of a September-meeting rate hike, but most investors see the next move in December.The Fed rate-hike buzz is a headwind and a tailwind for bank stocks. Rate hikes would probably help banks boost net interest margins. But with the general market selling off, it's hard for financials to advance.IBD'S TAKE: Bank earnings are long gone, but Fed news -- and key economic data that shift rate-hike expectations -- can give bank stocks a quick boost or cut them off.

Investment banking revenue for the quarter was weaker than expected.In slides accompanying the presentation, Citigroup said it was focused on three areas, North America, Mexico and Asia. In particular, Gerspach sees ""tremendous untapped potential"" in Mexico, touting improvements in Citigroup's card business there saying at the conference that the nation was ""a country that is still on the come,"" according to Reuters.Citigroup said revenue trends were improving in Asia and Latin America, with card revenue and retail banking helping the consumer banking market in Mexico pick up steam.Citigroup shares fell 0.4% to 46.75 in the stock market today, though it's still near the top of a recent consolidation JPMorgan (JPM) sank 0.2% while Goldman Sachs (GS) lost 0.5%.  Morgan Stanley (MS) closed 0.3% higher.JPMorgan, at the same conference earlier this week, said more millennials preferred it as their primary financial institution for checking, savings and credit-card accounts.The conference comes as U.S. banks outshine and take market share from their European rivals in investment banking. While some international markets have struggled, a Bank of America official at the Barclays conference this week said the opportunity for global expansion ""has never been better.""IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have rallied on more bullish remarks from Fed officials.

465,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) eliminated product sales goals for its consumer bankers as the company seeks to reassure regulators, lawmakers and customers after employees opened more than 2 million accounts without clients' approval.""We want to make certain our customers have full confidence that our retail bankers are always focused on the best interests of customers,"" Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said Tuesday in a statement.The Senate Banking Committee plans to hold a hearing Sept. 20 on San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, following last week's enforcement case in which regulators accused bank employees of opening deposit and credit-card accounts without approval to meet sales goals. Stumpf, 62, is among executives who've been asked to appear. Wells Fargo, which agreed to pay $185 million in fines, eliminated sales goals for retail bankers, effective Jan. 1, and instructed U.S. call center workers to temporarily halt cross-selling of financial products.Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the lender, said the U.S. Labor Day holiday was an additional incentive to drop the strategy for now because the days following it are traditionally a period of heavy call volume. Eliminating cross-selling was aimed at reducing the expected backlog, she said.The allegations have been a black eye for Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender and a marquee investment for billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is the bank's largest shareholder.Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said the bank will be able to adjust to changes needed to deal with the scandal.""We think we can adapt our business model, take sales goals out and still have a growth culture with people trying to deepen relationships with customers,"" Shrewsberry said Tuesday at a conference in New York. ""I think we can make this pivot in a way that protects our business model.""Most of the employees involved were not motivated by the need to generate revenue, he said. ""It was really more at the lower end of the performance scale, where people apparently were making bad choices to hang on to their job,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have rallied on more bullish remarks from Fed officials. While few are buys right now, read this story to find out which bank stocks are buys. About 10% of the 5,300 employees terminated as a result of the problem were managers, the CFO said, adding that the bank refunded $2.6 million in fees for about 115,000 unauthorized accounts, or about $25 per account. Two-thirds of those affected were in the U.S. Southwest, according to Shrewsberry.Wells Fargo declined 2.4% to $47.40 at 9:39 a.m. in New York, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index, which dropped 1.4%. The lender's stock has lost 13% this year, while the KBW Index fell 2.4%.Revelations that bank employees had opened the accounts are ""highly disturbing"" and could hurt holders of the bank's debt, Moody's Investors Service said Monday.The ""deficiencies"" uncovered by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other government investigators show that the bank's ""vaunted cross-selling capabilities were inflated,"" Moody's said in a report. The bank encouraged ""pervasive inappropriate practices"" and managers didn't provide oversight of employees, Moody's said.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the scandal should be a warning to critics of the CFPB, which was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.""There's a lot of talk in Washington these days about rolling back Dodd-Frank, about rolling back the law, changing the law that created the agency that uncovered and took action against this,"" Lew said Tuesday in an interview on CNBC. ""This ought to be a moment where people stop and remember how dangerous the system is when you don't have the proper protections in place.""The CFPB said last week that bank employees secretly opened the unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses. The company agreed to resolve the allegations without admitting or denying wrongdoing.Wells Fargo has come under fire from politicians since the fines were announced Thursday. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday praised the consumer watchdog for its work. She said that Donald Trump, her Republican rival, wants to dismantle the CFPB.The fines ""probably should lead to a pay clawback"" from Carrie Tolstedt, the Wells Fargo executive who ran community banking until the company announced her retirement in July, Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, wrote in a note to clients Monday.""These issues should have been caught sooner and dealt with more forcefully,"" he wrote.Tolstedt has unvested stock awards that would be worth about $17.8 million if the company hits certain financial targets. She'll also get $3.07 million in retirement benefits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn't include previously vested stock options that would be worth $38.5 million if exercised at Monday's stock-market close. Tolstedt, 56, also holds about $53 million of shares amassed during her 27-year career.RELATED:Bank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain Embrace Where Do Millennials Bank?

Still, the composite was below the 50-day moving average after gapping lower at the open. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were down 0.5%.Volume was tracking higher in today's trading.Utilities, real estate investment trusts and other stocks most sensitive to interest rates were the better-performing stocks. The diversified utilities industry group was up 1.6%, although most stocks in it are barely coming off their lows. The Dow utilities average surged 1.7%, easily the best index for the day.The property REIT group was up 1%, but it also suffers from a lack of quality charts. Most remain below the 50-day moving average, and in some cases that line is curving downward now. Bond yields fell today, countering a rising trend on expectations of an interest-rate increase by year's end.Banking stocks were mainly lower. JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) -- three banks that report earnings Friday -- were down 1% to 2%. Late Wednesday, Wells Fargo announced that CEO John Stumpf is stepping down. The bank has been roiled by a scandal in which bankers created accounts without customers' permission.Chips stocks also were weaker than most. The Philadelphia semiconductor index was down 1.5%, fighting to stay above a rising 50-day moving average.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) slid to its 50-day moving average in big volume. Shares appear to be finding support at that level, which could provide a new buy area. The chipmaker fell despite beating third-quarter sales and earnings. It also raised its guidance for the current quarter, thanks to a boost in chips for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7.Silicon Motion (SIMO) accelerated losses, tumbling nearly 7%. The stock is back to the lows of an irregular pattern and deeper below its 50-day line.Some energy stocks were leading the market. Oil prices were slightly higher, just above $50 a barrel on the NYMEX.

467,WFC,"The number of stock buybacks announced in September came in at a monthly low not seen since 2011, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) accounting for the bulk of the dollar value. Meanwhile, dividend growth in the last two quarters hit its weakest level since late 2009 and early 2010.Those findings, from research firm TrimTabs, come amid a bull market that has lasted some seven years and was often helped along by share repurchases. The firm expects share repurchases to continue to slow.The cooling buyback activity likely reflects growing caution among executives amid a volatile market trying to process mixed economic signals. S&P 500 earnings have fallen for several quarter, largely due to plunging energy profits.""When repurchases fall it can also indicate that CEOs are feeling less confident and flush, less willing to spend more money to bolster the value of their stock-based compensations,"" Winston Chua, an analyst at TrimTabs, said in an email. ""Buybacks often rise when CEOs are feeling good, because their bonuses are tied to EPS growth.""For the third quarter, share repurchases announced by U.S. companies fell to $115 billion, a more than two-year low, TrimTabs said in a release. There were 39 buybacks announced in September, the least in a month since January 2011, according to the firm.While new buybacks recovered to $59.9 billion last month from a 3 1/2 year low in August, ""underlying activity was not robust,"" TrimTabs said in a research report. Two-thirds of September's results came from a $40 billion share repurchase approved by Microsoft, while American Express also announced a $6.3 billion buyback during the month.""The dearth of buybacks in the past month/quarter is particularly eye-opening because many companies don't care what price they pay for their shares because CEOs and CFOs aren't spending their own money,"" Chua added in the email. ""They're spending shareholders' money.""Microsoft dipped 0.3% to to close at 57.42 on the stock market today, going just below its 50-day line as it makes its way through a flat base begun in August.American Express shaved off 0.4% to end the trading day at 63.81. AmEx is trading in a narrow channel just below the 50-day line and above its 200-day. The credit-card issuer in July had been among the Dow's bigger laggards following the loss of partners like Costco (COST) and JetBlue (JBLU).Apple (AAPL), which also struggled to pace the Dow this summer, led the S&P 500 in buybacks in the second quarter. But buyback volume overall during that quarter was lowest in eight quarters, TrimTabs said in the report. Apple shares fell 0.5% to 112.52 at the close, still above a recent 110.33 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding, while dividends put cash in shareholders' hands. Check out this story on which companies led S&P 500 buybacks in Q2. ""Apart from megacap technology firms like Apple and Microsoft and too-big-to-fails like J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, corporate America has become less eager to use cash to support share prices,"" TrimTabs said in its report.Dividend growth has also fallen off this year. TrimTabs said dividend growth ""in the latest two quarters was the lowest since late 2009 and early 2010.""That weakness has been particularly pronounced within the energy sector, which has been battered by a rout in commodity prices. Exxon Mobil (XOM), however, has been an exception, paying out $3.13 billion in dividends in the second quarter, the most in the S&P 500, according to FactSet.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged down 8 cents to close at 66.51. Wells Fargo (WFC) sank 1% to 43.83, now trading at its worst levels since December 2013 as the fallout from its cross-sharing scandal continues to spread.RELATED:American Airlines Seen More Aggressively Cutting Buybacks In 2017

469,WFC,"Happy Columbus Day, dear ETF investors. In honor of that illustrious forebear and intrepid voyager, let us discover potential movers and shakers within the world of exchange traded funds this week.Third-quarter earnings get underway in earnest Tuesday with Alcoa's (AA) report. It's an especially big week for the big banks.We can hope Wells Fargo (WFC) fares better on its earnings call Friday than Wells Chief Executive John Stump recently did before lawmakers.Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also report Friday.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) last week closed above the 50-day moving average — a marker of short-term health — for the first time in four weeks.The big banks' earnings will play a role in whether XLF holds above that level or caves under, and whether or not it finally shakes off its year-to-date sloth.Some big chip earnings are in the works too: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) on Thursday and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Oct. 20.U.K. chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor gave Apple (AAPL) shares a boost last week after reporting solid sales.And tech ETFs with big stakes in Apple and its iPhone suppliers are showing bullish momentum. Among them: iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX).How could you not be dazzled by the chart?Last week, two flagship commodity ETFs made headlines for very different reasons.United States Oil (USO), which invests in near-month West Texas intermediate futures, made a three-month high. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which tracks the price of spot gold, fell to a four-month low.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is making the right noises about a production freeze. That's helping to boost ""black gold,"" but any concrete action will be formalized only in November.In the meantime, train your eyes on the USO chart. It may offer a buying opportunity at 12.55 if it successfully breaks out of a first-stage base.Keep in mind this would be a turnaround story, rather than your typical growth story. USO is trading near its lowest level in a decade at 11.34, and there's no clear signal yet that crude oil is out of the hole.Gold's hefty loss last week came amid a September jobs report that is likely to keep the Fed on course for a rate hike by year's end. That doesn't bode well in the near term for gold, which bears no yield.This week, will GLD ETF reclaim the 200-day moving average or fall further under it? The former would be a bullish sign, the latter bearish.However, Goldman Sachs sees a buying opportunity in the yellow metal if it gets even more tarnished.You'll find room in your portfolio for gold if you think for a moment about the uncertainties in the stock and commodity markets.Gold's a safe haven and a portfolio diversifier. Not to mention, shares of GLD are at $120 vs. $186 at the peak in 2011.The minutes from the September meeting of the Federal Reserve are on tap for Wednesday and Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks Friday at a Boston conference, ponderously themed ""The Elusive 'Great' Recovery: Causes and Implications for Future Business Cycle Dynamics.""IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold or just right?

470,WFC,"Banking and other financial stocks led a broad market sell-off Thursday.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average was off 1.1%. The three indexes traded poorly heading into the close, but were off their mid-afternoon lows%. Small caps suffered more, with the Russell 2000 shaving 1.2%.Volume was running sharply higher across the board. Losses were broad. Only the energy sector still showed a gain in today's trading. Losing stocks led winners significantly.Financials were roiled after Bloomberg reported that a number of funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche Bank (DB) took out excess cash and positions, according to an internal document seen by the news agency. In addition, there is concern about a recent U.S. Justice Department request for $14 billion to settle an investigation into the German bank's mortgage-backed securities.The SPDR Financial (XLF) exchange traded fund slid 1.4%. Wells Fargo (WFC), one of the ETF's largest holdings, was down to the lowest level since February 2014 as the bank continued to be grilled over its fabricated customer accounts scandal. Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 2.1%.One financial stock holding up well was Ellie Mae (ELLI) as shares rose 1.1% to 103.39. The provider of software for the mortgage-application industry held most gains after rising past the 102.73 buy point. Volume has faded, though, to above average but not powerful.Medical stocks also were weaker, and some in unusually heavy volume.Mylan (MYL) -- which has been hounded over the steep $600 price of its EpiPen anti-allergy treatment -- lost more than 4%, falling intraday to the lowest level in nearly a year.Smith & Nephew (SNN), the British maker of wound-care, orthopaedic and other medical products, fell 2.6% in very heavy trade.

471,WFC,"Deutsche Bank (DB) tumbled to a fresh all-time low as hedge funds that act as counterparties in derivatives trades stopped dealing with the beleaguered German financial giant. That rising mistrust raised concerns about the broader financial system, even as most financial experts insisted that this is not another ""Lehman"" moment, when the financial system froze up in the fall of 2008 after Lehman Bros.' collapse.Big bank stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) are falling, not plunging, but are undercutting their 50-day moving averages.Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares fell 6.7% to close at 11.48 on the stock market today, hitting even lower levels intraday. The SPDR Financial ETF (XLF) lost 1.4% to 19.04, finding resistance recently at the 50-day line.JPMorgan fell 1.6% to 65.65, threatening to close below its 50-day line for the first time since July 11. JPMorgan is still above a 65.08 buy point first cleared in early August, but undercutting key support lines is not encouraging.Bank of America dropped 1.4% to finish trading at 15.16 while Citigroup (C) lost 2.3% to 45.80. Both BofA and Citi finished below their 50-day moving average.Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 2.1% to close at 44.37, dropping below recent lows to hit its worst levels since February 2014. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testified before a House panel Thursday regarding his bank's cross-selling scandal after Senate lawmakers grilled him last week.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley (MS) ended the session down 2.3% to 31.04, but still above its 50-day line.

472,WFC,"Synchrony Financial's (SYF) warning that its net charge-off rates would be worse than anticipated over the next year sent shares diving Tuesday, also dragging down American Express (AXP), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One (COF).Synchrony, a recent General Electric (GE) spinoff that provides private-label credit cards to a variety of businesses, said it expected a 20-30 basis point increase in net charge-off rates -- a measure of debt that a company no longer expects to get back and has deemed a loss -- and would build up reserves accordingly in Q2.Shares plunged 13.3% to close at 26.45 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50- and 200-day moving averages. American Express dropped 4.1% to 61.07, while Discover lost 4.1% to 53.27, sinking below its 50-day, and Capital One tumbled 6.6% to 64.43. But GE rose 2% to 30.44.While Synchrony said it expected some level of weakness and that its loss rate was ""at historically low levels,"" the announcement came amid growing anxiety about consumer debt.""The consumer's ability to cure themselves when they get into those later due stages has been challenged,"" CFO Brian Doubles said at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in New York on Tuesday. ""It's been challenged all year.""And as auto loans grow, so have warnings about potentially higher delinquencies. Other analysts have said banks are running out of higher-quality borrowers to target, forcing them to reach for less reliable ones.Meanwhile, Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which do not issue credit cards but act as the middleman between businesses and banks, were less affected. Visa inched up 0.2% to 78.57, while Mastercard eased less than 0.1% to 94.11.Top banks, which issues cards, also sold off, though ""Brexit"" fears have been weighing on financial stocks. Bank of America (BAC) fell 2.5% to 13.26, Citigroup (C) lost 2.8% to 41.96, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was down 1.9% to 62.08, and Wells Fargo (WFC) surrendered 2.3% to 46.88.
"
473,WFC,"The troubling takeaway from the surprisingly weak May jobs numbers is that the economy is stuck in slow-growth mode for the foreseeable future.While last month's overall gain of 38,000 jobs, including a 25,000 rise in private payrolls, was dragged down temporarily by the labor strike of 35,000 Verizon (VZ) communications workers, the weakness was broad-based. On net, just 51.3% of industries added jobs, the lowest since February 2010, Labor Department data showed.Considering that Verizon likely brought in some temp workers during the now-resolved strike, private payrolls were close to flat in May outside of health care, which added 45,700 jobs last month and just under a half million over the past year.Although there were some pockets of hiring strength, the weak job gains and downward revisions totaling 59,000 to the increases reported in March and April suggest that growth is getting much harder to come by as the economic expansion gets long in the tooth.The slowdown looks like more than a one-month blip: The 155,000 private-sector jobs added over the past two months is the worst stretch since January 2011 -- even assuming that the strike artificially knocked 25,000-35,000 off the total.As markets priced in a slower timetable for Federal Reserve rate hikes, shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) sold off hard on the stock market today.Instead of a likely hike in July, markets now see the Fed waiting until November, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed. The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to 1.71%, and the dollar fell 1.5% against other major currencies.One decent bit of news in the employment report is that the trend of firming wages remained intact, as hourly pay rose 0.2% from April and 2.5% from a year ago. That's consistent with anecdotal reports of companies having to pay more to attract or keep good workers, and many finding qualified workers in short supply.Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Wendy's (WEN) have all said they've raised pay in recent months.The drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% from 5% in April appears at first to be consistent with a tight labor market. Still, the sudden drop in joblessness, which reflected fewer people in the workforce rather than an increase in employment, should be taken with a grain of salt, given the household survey's higher margin of error.Yet the overriding problem is that employers, who are now paying new employees more, are seeing profit margins pressured and finding that opportunities for profitable growth have narrowed.""The 'disconnect' between weak real GDP growth and strong employment growth seems to be resolving itself as employers are defending profits (and trying to boost productivity) in a soggy environment by managing payroll costs,"" wrote IHS Global Insight economists Nariman Behravesh and Ozlem Yaylaci.The reality portrayed by the weak jobs report got some confirmation from the Institute for Supply Management's survey of non-manufacturing industries, with the index slipping to a 28-month low of 52.9 in May from 55.7 in April -- well below expectations. The employment gauge fell into negative territory, dropping 3.3 points to 49.7, just below the neutral 50 level.A range of other economic data points and industry trends suggest a similar conclusion that the much-anticipated pick-up in growth may not materialize.Analysts think U.S. auto sales are close to peaking, and those views were supported by lower sales in May for General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), even as Autodata reports that incentives have climbed north of $3,000 per vehicle.Construction spending fell a surprising 1.8% in April, more than reversing March's gain. To top off that bad news, the construction sector shed 15,000 jobs in May after losing 5,000 in April. Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said that many private developers are concerned by possible overbuilding in commercial, office and lodging markets and sense that ""the current real estate cycle is now in its seventh inning or later.""Wal-Mart closed 154 U.S. stores at the start of the year, and Macy's (M) and other department stores are cutting their square footage as Amazon (AMZN) continues to eat into their business. Even Home Depot (HD), in one of the strongest retail sectors, hasn't added any stores in the U.S. in more than a year.Somehow, the retail sector has seemingly defied gravity when it comes to employment, adding 11,400 jobs last month and 323,000 over the past year. The explanation may be that the workweek has shrunk, since aggregate hours of work in the retail industry are down 0.3% over the past three months.Food services and drinking places added 22,200 jobs in May. But the accommodation sector shed 1,500 jobs, after cutting 2,300 the prior month.Manufacturers cut 18,000 jobs in May. While the sector has stabilized, there's little hope for an upturn, with the dollar still strong and global growth still weak.

474,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led a bank stock rally Wednesday as the Federal Reserve signaled that a June rate hike was more likely than markets had been predicting.Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve April policy meeting showed that many policymakers backed a June rate hike if data showed an improving economy. Some members said they wanted a hike at the April gathering.The major averages lost most of their Wednesday gains on that 2 p.m. release, but bank stocks largely held onto their gains. A rate hike could boost banks' results by allowing them to charge higher rates on loans, widening their net interest margins.Bank of America stock closed up 4.85% in the stock market today. Citigroup climbed 5%, JPMorgan Chase 3.9%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 4.1% and Wells Fargo (WFC) advanced 2.2%. JPMorgan also benefited from late Tuesday news that it was raising its dividend.Bank stocks had already rallied after San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan signaled Tuesday that a rate hike was possible.Williams told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that data are lining up ""to make a good case for rate increases in the next few meetings.""Kaplan said he’s calling for a rate hike “in the not-too-distant future,” adding that he may push for the move at the June meeting, the Journal reported.And Lockhart told Politico in a roundtable discussion that ""I think it certainly could be a meeting in which action could be taken."" 
"
475,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) and their venture capital units invested more in fintech companies over the past year than their rivals did, but growing concerns about the industry could taper investments this year and boost the odds of consolidation, a new report from CB Insights and KPMG found.Goldman or its corporate venture segments logged nine such deals for fintechs from the first quarter last year to the first quarter of this year, while Citi or its related units had seven, according to the report. Along those lines, two deals were accredited to JPMorgan (JPM) or its venture units, and one each for Wells Fargo (WFC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Capital One (COF).Matthew Wong, an analyst with CB Insights, said the types of investments have run across the fintech spectrum, and banks show growing willingness to collaborate with an industry that could move much of our finances to our mobile devices and overhaul the way bank branches are used.""In some cases, you're seeing banks like Goldman Sachs or others do deals in a lot of these different new areas that are emerging to have a (strategy) -- not just investment -- but being able to monitor how these spaces are evolving,"" Wong said.The investments over the past five quarters included a round of financing in Financeit, a real-time consumer financing firm, that was led by a Goldman affiliate and closed in October. Another division of Goldman led a $40 million round of funding, announced last April, for Hong Kong's CompareAsiaGroup, a site that allows consumers to compare different financial services.Citigroup's venture arm helped lead a $30 million investment, announced in September, in Chain, a company that uses blockchain -- a technology that uses shared ledger databases to cut down on middlemen -- to facilitate transactions.The report comes amid a murkier outlook for the fintech industry. On one hand, investments in fintech companies overall in the first quarter nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.7 billion globally over 468 deals, marking a recovery from the $3.1 billion raised in the fourth quarter, the report said. A recent bond offering from online lender SoFi got a triple-A rating from Moody's.And the report also talked about a massive new front opening up in insurance-related fintech, which Wong said raised more than $2.6 billion last year.""Why consumers have come to dislike insurance is there's a lot of lack of transparency,"" Wong said.He also said that far more tech entrepreneurs have tried to make getting insurance easier through online comparison platforms, brokerages and other avenues than in the past, with the Affordable Care Act even inspiring innovation despite the industry's high barriers.""The regulatory environment, as difficult as it is in other financial services, is extremely difficult to navigate for a lot of startups who are coming in, guns blazing, trying to disrupt the industry,"" Wong said.But the report also said that funding for venture-capital-backed fintech was on pace for a 10% drop in North America this year, and that U.S. investors had lost some interest in payments companies.""In North America especially, there were fewer startups in the payments space during Q1 ’16, likely due to market saturation and the success of market leaders Square (SQ) and Stripe,"" it said.And online peer-to-peer lenders, like OnDeck (ONDK), have faced concerns about insufficient loan volumes. Prosper, another online lender, said in February it would lay off around 28% of its staff.Calls for greater regulation of such online lenders have also grown amid questions about the conduct of some in the sector. The Justice Department said it would investigate online lending platform Lending Club (LC) after its chief executive resigned following a review that found that the company allegedly misled an investor on a loan sale.Shares of Lending Club have thrashed around in recent weeks, crashing after the investigations were announced and rebounding slightly after a group of Singapore-based companies said they had accumulated an 11.7% stake. On Wednesday, shares edged up 0.45%, OnDeck added 0.4%, while Square fell 1.4%. Goldman Sachs rallied 2.3%, and Citi rose 2.35%.Given those challenges, the CB Insights/KPMG report said that ""some consolidation ... is likely over the next 12 months"" in the North American fintech industry overall.And it questioned whether those difficulties could dampen investors' interest in the sector. ""It remains to be seen how the recent announcements by Lending Club and Prosper will impact that appetite and whether the balance of power switches back to more traditional financial institutions,"" Conor Moore, a senior official for KPMG's venture capital group, said in the report.

480,WFC,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have rallied over the past week as Federal Reserve officials expressed more openness to an interest-rate hike, but are any of them buys right now? Just one.JPMorgan erased intraday losses to closed uncahnged at 67.50 on the stock market today, still in range after clearing a 66.58 buy point on Monday from handle in a consolidation. Volume on the breakout was barely average, not a great sign. A stock is considered within buying range if it is 5% or less above a buy point.Super regional SunTrust Banks (STI) and Great Western Bancorp (GWB), meanwhile, are basing and are near buy points.SunTrust rallied to close up 0.2% to 44.07 Wednesday, just below a 44.29 entry area. Great Western finished 0.3% higher at 34.24 as it makes its way through a flat base with a 35.11 entry.TD (TD), meanwhile, was carving its way through a flat base with a 45.84 buy point. TD fell 0.5% to 44.60 Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Bank earnings are long gone, but Fed news -- and key economic data that shift rate hike expectations -- can give bank stocks a quick boost or cut them off. Pay attention to Friday's jobs report. And if you're holding financial stocks or ETFs, consider this risk-limiting earnings options strategy.Meanwhile, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are showing some constructive action, but are far from a proper buy zone.Bank of America lost 0.3% but is building the right side of a deep base, with strong gains since clearing its 200-day line on Aug. 5.

481,WFC,"Stock indexes sagged in afternoon trading Wednesday as volume stayed in a below-average mode.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6%, with the Dow approaching its 50-day line. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.Below-average turnover has been the trend for some time now. The S&P 500 appears headed for its 23rd consecutive day of below-average volume. The Nasdaq looked to be on track for its 18th session in a row of below-average volume. Seasonality alone doesn't explain it: Last year, there were plenty of above-average days on both major exchanges.One sector that hasn't had too much trouble lately attracting respectable upside volume is the banks. Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 6% over the past five weeks, while the Nasdaq rose 1% in the same period and the S&P 500 has been flat. (Five weeks is the time period IBD uses to define current action in the Market Pulse.)IBD splits the bank sector into seven industry groups. In the past five weeks, the best bank groups have been super regional banks, up 5%; money centers, up 5%; and west-southwest banks, up 4%. The biggest stocks by market cap in those groups are U.S. Bancorp (USB), super regional; Wells Fargo, money centers; and First Republic Bank (FRC), west-southwest.The banks are riding the conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, thereby improving net interest margins.

485,WFC,"When push came to shove, Mylan (MYL) couldn't find any friends among Republicans, even though they said they wished they could defend the drugmaker.At a congressional hearing in Washington Wednesday, GOP lawmakers who described themselves as ""free market"" and ""pro-business"" said the drugmaker's aggressive pricing of its EpiPen allergy shot — the cost of which went up about sixfold since Mylan acquired it in 2007 — had gone too far. They described themselves as upset both about the price increases as well as Chief Executive Heather Bresch's $19.4 million in awarded pay.""I am a very pro-business Republican, yet I am really sickened by what I've heard about this situation,"" Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., said at the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform session. ""Nobody can really earn or deserve"" that much money, he said.The company has become the latest in lawmakers' sights as both parties have made drug prices a focus of their oversight efforts. Most of the discussion about regulating the industry's pricing practices has been led by Democrats, including presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has a proposal to monitor and push back on increases.The drugmaker certainly isn't the only business Republicans have recently taken to task. Earlier this week, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) was called a ""fraud"" and ""completely out of touch"" by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., after the bank's employees opened accounts without customers' permission.At the Mylan hearing, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., gestured at his colleagues and said many of them had little idea about business or how the corporate world worked. But then he turned to Bresch, and described the company's lobbying efforts on behalf of laws encouraging or requiring schools to keep devices like EpiPen on hand. The shots now cost about $600 for a two-pack, and the vast majority of states now require or encourage schools to stock epinephrine devices.""You came and you asked the government to get in your business, so here we are today,"" Mulvaney said. ""If you want to come into Washington, if you want to come into state capitals, and lobby us to make us buy your stuff, this is what you get. You get a level of scrutiny and a level of treatment that would ordinarily curl my hair, but you asked for it.""Bresch defended the drugmaker, saying that the price increases had helped it fund better patient access and that it actually collects less than half of the $600 list price.""I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing minority of patients"" who may end up paying the full list price, said Bresch, who is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WVa.Mulvaney is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, an ultraconservative group of House Republicans who often break with Speaker Paul Ryan. Committee member Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican, is a member of Congress's Republican Study Committee, a conservative policy group — and took Bresch to task as well.""I think you all have behaved very badly and invited government regulation,"" Farenthold lectured the CEO. ""I am very much for free market. But this whole drug pricing system that we have right now makes no sense to me, and a free market can't operate in a system where people like me, who are consumers, don't understand it.""Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the committee, said he couldn't sympathize with how Mylan was charging hundreds of dollars when the medicine inside EpiPen cost about $1.""Trying to dive into the depths of individual drug pricing was not something I set out to initially do,"" Chaffetz said at the start of the hearing. As Bresch defended her company and said she was surprised by the outrage, Chaffetz asked her, ""You never anticipated this? You raised the price, what did you think was going to happen?""Mylan is run from Canonsburg, Pa., but is officially registered in the Netherlands after a so-called tax inversion. Its shares have dropped 15% in five weeks after lawmakers started raising questions about EpiPen. Shares were up 3% in early trading.

486,WFC,"Federal Reserve stress tests of the nation's eight largest banks just became a bigger impediment to issuing dividends and buying back shares, but the first exam under the new rules won't hit until 2018.In a Monday speech, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said that the eight U.S.-based banks important to the global financial system will face increased capital requirements under the new testing regime.Those eight banks are Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), State Street (STT) and Wells Fargo (WFC) (IBD).The biggest banks, with the highest capital requirements, will face the biggest impact from the change. Meanwhile, stress-testing and record-keeping will become somewhat less burdensome for banks with less than $250 billion in assets, Tarullo said.The changes to the stress-testing regime are consistent ""with the principle that financial regulation should be progressively more stringent for firms of greater importance, and thus potential risk, to the financial system,"" he said.Shares of Goldman Sachs sank 2.2% on the stock market today, piercing its 50-day moving average after back-to-back days of negative regulatory news. On Friday, the Fed released a proposed rule that would require Goldman, Morgan Stanley and other banks that take physical possession of commodities in metals and energy markets to hold more capital.Shares of JPMorgan fell 2.2%, closing pennies above their 50-day line after undercutting that support intraday. JPMorgan is still above a 65.08 buy point.Citigroup lost 2.7% and Bank of America 2.8%, both closing below their 50-day.Wells Fargo stock, which have been pummeled after disclosures it fraudulently opened millions of customer accounts, fell further on Monday, fell 1.9% to 44.88, its first close below 45 since February 2014.Morgan Stanley fell 2.8% and State Street 1.8%, but both remain above their 50-day averages.The Wells Fargo news increases the small but real political risk that Congress will seek to break up the big banks in 2017.""Large banks will lose additional political capital in the wake of the Wells Fargo headlines and will find it tougher to find allies in Congress to defend the banks,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' Washington analyst Brian Gardner.Another cloud for the banking sector comes from abroad, with Deutsche Bank (DB) shares sinking amid funding concerns as it girds for a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department, which is seeking a $14 billion fine in connection with the German bank's financial-crisis-era mortgage bond sales.U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank were down 7.1% to 11.85, hitting a record-low 11.23 intraday following reports that it sought help from Berlin in its Justice Department fight. The bank denied the reports and said it doesn't plan to increase its capital.IBD'S TAKE: Some bank stocks have traded more tightly as Wall Street speculates whether the Federal Reserve will decide to hike rates this year. See more details about which bank stocks might be in buy range. Under a 2015 rule, the biggest banks already face a requirement that they hold bigger capital buffers against losses. Now the Fed will incorporate those capital surcharges when it determines whether banks, in high-stress economic and financial conditions, would have sufficient capital to pay dividends and buy back shares.Some banks have worked to reduce their capital surcharge by decreasing deposits or derivatives holdings, and the stress-test change could lead to more of the same.Tarullo also said that stress tests have previously only looked at a bank's health based on its direct exposures to recessionary conditions, but would in the future factor in indirect effects from financial markets. One such indirect effect would come from ""the reduction in portfolio values for one bank by other banks selling certain types of assets in order to enhance their own solvency,"" Tarullo noted.Tarullo said that the stress tests won't be updated until 2018, except to grant some relief to non-systemically important banks.RELATED:JPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Waver As Rates To Stay Lower For Longer Wells Fargo Stock Takes Hits, But Dividend, Earnings Still Intact Citigroup, Like BofA, Sets Sights Abroad, But Q3 View Mixed

Sinclair says it expects Q3 media revenue of $637 million to $638 million, up 28%, including some $46 million in political spending. That's down from an August forecast of $649.2 million to $663.2 million including $58 million to $68 million in political ads.""While we previously anticipated a decline in Presidential ad spending in the third quarter based on the late fundraising by the Trump campaign, we have yet to see significant spending, even at the levels we initially anticipated,"" Chief Financial Officer Chris Ripley said in a statement.Other factors are dragging political spending, Ripley noted. A ""historically large political advertiser"" plans to direct funds to organizing voters rather than campaign funding.

And if you're holding financial stocks or ETFs, consider this risk-limiting earnings options strategy.The bank hadn't disclosed the investigation in recent regulatory filings.""Each quarter we consider all available relevant and appropriate facts and circumstances in determining whether a litigation matter is material and disclosed in our public filings,"" Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an email. ""Based upon that review, we determined that the matter was not material.""Thousands of employees at Wells Fargo were involved in opening accounts and moving funds that resulted in customers getting charged fees for services they didn't seek, according to the regulators. Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer sued Wells Fargo last year and accused the bank of high-pressure quotas for workers that encouraged them to skirt the rules.""When I worked at Wells Fargo, I faced the threat of being fired if I didn't meet their unreasonable sales quotes every day, and it's high time that Wells Fargo pays for preying on consumers' financial livelihoods,"" Khalid Taha, a former employee, said in a statement.RELATED:Big Bank Stocks Are Leading, But Only This One Is A Buy Now Bank Of America Leads Big Banks Higher On Fed Rate Hike TalkWells Fargo Has Energy Drain; Citigroup Gets Fixed-Income Boost

491,WFC,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Friday that the case for a rate hike has ""strengthened"" in recent months, as labor market slack is fading.The U.S. economy is ""now nearing the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability,"" Yellen said.Financial markets, which already have been pricing in a good chance of a rate hike in December, initially took her comments in stride. Investors are less concerned about the timing of the next hike than the one after that. Treasury yields initially rose a bit, then headed slightly lower after release of Yellen's speech transcript.That was before Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC that he saw Yellen's comments as consistent with a rate hike at the September meeting. Further, he said, a second increase could come as early as December, adding that the Fed won't know what's appropriate ""until we see the data.""Those comments caused a bit more turbulence, with the 10-year Treasury yield bouncing from an intraday low of 1.53% to 1.59%. Major stock indexes gave up modest gains stock market today and turned red, though afternoon losses were slim.After Fischer's comments market pricing still points to the next hike being in December, CME Group's FedWatch tool shows, though the odds of a hike in September edged up from 21% to 30%.But if Fischer's comments about two hikes this year begin to look realistic, bond market pricing will have to shift pretty markedly. Right now, markets are pricing in just a 31% chance of a second hike coming by the meeting on July 26, 2017.Yellen's speech and Fischer's comments both underscore just how unsure Fed policymakers are about the future. In addition to talking about economic data showing the Fed's goals of full employment and 2% inflation may be around the corner, Yellen highlighted arguments pointing to very low interest rates for a long time to come.""By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close to zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow productivity growth and high global saving,"" Yellen said.The neutral interest rate is the rate at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive.The path of rate hikes next year is the big issue for investors. Even as markets have shifted in recent weeks toward expecting a rate hike as early as December, the 10-year Treasury yield has drifted slightly lower. The reason markets have been so calm about the next rate increase is that investors don't expect an ensuing hike until at least the fall of 2017.Yellen, as expected, didn't offer any precise timing for the next Fed interest rate hike. Markets had already moved up the expected timing after a run of mostly better-than-expected data, including the strong July jobs report, a jump in new-home sales and a surge in durable goods orders. New data on Friday were on the soft side, though, with second-quarter GDP growth revised down to 1.1%, and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipping unexpectedly.Banks, which stand to benefit from higher rates, perked up with Yellen's comments about a stronger case for a rate hike, but later gave up much of their gains. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) each saw minor gains, but Bank of America (BAC) was up 1.4%.
"
492,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC) rallied after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the case for raising rates has improved, but JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and some other big banks pared Friday gains after her deputy back two hikes this year.""Indeed, in light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,"" Yellen said in Jackson Hole, Wyo.Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer followed up, saying that Yellen's comments are consistent with a September rate hike, while he said he still sees two rate  hikes this year. Investors raised the odds of a near-term hike, but still see just one hike, in December.Bank of America climbed 1.7% on the stock market today. Citigroup (C) rose 0.8% and Morgan Stanley (MS) 0.6%. JPMorgan rose 0.2%, Goldman Sachs (GS)  climbed fractionally and Wells Fargo (WFC) advanced 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Low rates continue to be among the main challenges for the banking industry. A Federal Reserve rate hike would effectively give banks the green light to raise their own interest rates, allowing them to take in more money from loans. Learn more on how to evaluate stocks here.Some Fed officials have become more bullish on raising rates in recent weeks. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC Friday that September could be a good time for a rate hike. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester told the network that the economy would get stronger in the second half of the year.Analysts and investors had expected Yellen to use the speech to prime the U.S. for an eventual interest-rate hike.RELATED:Fed's Yellen Says Rate Hike Case Has 'Strengthened' As Labor Markets Tighten

494,WFC,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKB) investments took a hit in the first quarter as financial stocks pulled down the value of his ""Big Four"" companies.Berkshire's holdings in American Express (AXP) and Wells Fargo (WFC) both fell in value, partly offset by increases in the other half of the ""Big Four"" -- top food and beverage stock, Coca-Cola (KO), and IBM (IBM), which both grew in value. Coke closed down 0.2% Monday, and IBM ended virtually flat.Financials were among the hardest-hit industries in the first quarter as interest rates lingered near record lows and the energy slump continued. Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter financial results on Friday after the market closed.Berkshire reported an 8% increase in first-quarter revenue to $52.4 billion. Net earnings rose 8.1% to $5.66 billion.And railroad, utilities and energy revenue slid 11% to $8.85 billion amid a slump in the railroad industry. The company expects that to change.""As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we concluded that there were no unrealized losses that were other than temporary,"" Berkshire said in its report on Friday.The Big Four accounted for about 60% of Berkshire's stock holdings as of March 31, up a bit from 59% the prior quarter. The value of the holdings changed from the end of 2015 to March 31 for various reasons, including company stock buybacks that boosted share values.The value of Berkshire's Coca-Cola shares rose to $18.6 billion at the end of the first quarter from $17.2 billion at the end of 2015. Its holdings in IBM grew to $12.3 billion from $11.2 billion.However, the value of its Wells Fargo stock slid to $24.2 billion from $27.2 billion and American Express fell to $9.3 billion from $10.5 billion.Railroad, utilities and energy stock holdings rose to $1.29 billion from $1.24 billion even as revenue from Berkshire-owned companies in its Railroad, Utilities and Energy business fell 11% to $8.85 billion, including a sharp drop by its BNSF Railway, which has been battered by lower shipments of energy products including coal and oil.Berkshire total stock investments in finance companies' stocks declined 5% to $106.42 billion.Berkshire bought 425 million shares of H.J. Heinz, now a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz (KHC) in June 2013 and has added to those holdings, which it said in the report have a ""liquidation preference of $8 billion"" as of March 31. Aggregate costs for the Kraft Heinz stock investments was $12.25 billion. Kraft Heinz rose 0.2% to 84.19 Monday afternoon.It also has $2.1 billion worth of gum maker Wrigley, which is owned by privately held candy and snacks maker Mars. It has 3 million shares of plastics and agricultural products maker Dow Chemical (DOW), valued at about $3 billion, and owns 9% of Canada-based Restaurant Brands International (QSR), parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Restaurant Brands was down 1%.Berkshire Hathaway shares closed down 1.2% in the stock market today. It fell to a 123.55 low on Feb. 3 before turning up.

495,WFC,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett will give his insight into the company and markets at Saturday's eagerly awaited annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb.Buffett made Berkshire Hathaway's largest-ever purchase in January and reshuffled the company's portfolio.On Jan. 29, Berkshire announced it had completed the $37.2 billion (including debt) purchase of Precision Castparts, its biggest buyout ever.Berkshire's net worth rose by $15.4 billion in 2015 as the company bought more shares of favorites IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire expects about 40,000 shareholders from around the world to attend the event. But you don't have to visit Omaha in person: For the first time ever, the so-called ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" will be streamed live, on Yahoo Finance. Buffett will offer his comments in what a press statement described as a ""no holds barred"" Q&A with him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.Buffett, 85, has said in the past that he and the board have agreed on a successor, but he hasn't disclosed who that is. Munger is 92.S&P Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a recent report that Berkshire's growth strategy is continuing to pay off.""Our buy opinion reflects our view that Berkshire's ability to grow its revenue base (both organically and through acquisitions) and maintain margins, despite a mixed economic outlook, will enable the shares to retain their premium valuation"" vs. its peers and the broader market. S&P Capital IQ has a 152 price target on Berkshire's Class B stock.For the full year 2015, net earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion, and revenue grew 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014. Net earnings for the Dec. 31-ended quarter climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share minus one-time items for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in the fourth quarter, well above analyst estimates of $1.75.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for EPS to rise 3% to $1.78 for the current quarter, up from $1.72 in Q1 2015. Berkshire's BNSF Railroad continues to be a drag on earnings amid an oversupplied energy market and plunging coal shipments. BNSF's total railcar units for the week ended April 16 fell by 21% vs. the same quarter a year earlier to about 81,000 units.Berkshire Class B stock hasn't formed a viable base recently. It dropped to an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and has bounced nicely since then. It's risen about 18%, climbing above its 10-week average and 200-day line along the way. Berkshire's B shares closed up less than 0.1% at 146.18 in the stock market today.Berkshire Hathaway boasts a solid 81 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 81% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Image provided by Shutterstock.

496,WFC,"Energy remains a drag for Wells Fargo (WFC), which charged off $204 million in energy loans in Q1, up about 75% from Q4, and added $200 million to its energy loan-loss reserves, while the tally of oil sector bankruptcies climbed higher with a filing Thursday from Energy XXI (EXXI).Bank of America (BAC) boosted its energy loan-loss reserves by $525 million vs. Q4 levels to $1 billion in Q1.The collapse of crude oil prices since mid-2014 has battered energy companies. More than 50 North American oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy protection since early 2015, according to a Reuters analysis.Houston-based Energy XXI, one of the biggest shallow-water drillers in the Gulf of Mexico, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday.Despite Wells Fargo's exposure to the oil bust, the San Francisco-based lender beat Q1 estimates, earning 99 cents a share, down 5% from Q1 2015 and topping views by 2 cents. Revenue rose 4.3% to $22.2 billion, beating views of $21.6 billion.Total loans grew 10% to $947.3 billion. Commercial loans rose 19% to $488.2 billion, due in part to Well Fargo's acquisition of General Electric's (GE) commercial lending and leasing unit, as well as its railcar leasing unit.Wells Fargo shares closed 0.5% lower on the stock market today. Energy XXI shares sank 80% to less than 13 cents. GE edged up 0.1%Long considered a bellwether for the housing market due to its robust mortgage portfolio, Wells said its mortgage applications rose 20% to $77 billion, while originations fell 6% to $44 billion.

Total loans and leases rose 3% to $901 billion. The bank issued 1.2 million new U.S. consumer cards in Q1, and total debit and credit card activity increased 5%.The positive numbers were enough to send BofA's shares up 2.5%.The downside wasn't that bad for Bank of America, since the result was expected, given stocks' horrendous start to the year. Total trading revenue fell 16% to $3.8 billion, with fixed-income trading falling 17% to $2.4 billion. Equities revenue fell 11% to $1.04 billion. Investment banking revenue tumbled 20% to $1.2 billion.""It was a really bad quarter for the Street across the board,"" said Dan Burrows, a senior writer at InvestorPlace.

Total assets rose 2% to $2.2 trillion.Analysts weren't expecting great things from big banks in Q1, so it's mostly been a case of under-promising and over-delivering. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) beat Q1 estimates when it reported results on Wednesday, thanks to a strong performance in its commercial and consumer units overcoming weakness in trading revenue and energy loan losses.Citigroup (C) reports Q1 earnings on Friday.

"
499,WFC,"The first quarter of 2016 is being called the worst for U.S. banks since the financial crisis and the rest of the year doesn't look much better.This week, the big money center banks report first-quarter earnings and expectations are for them to be worse than the year-ago quarter. Since financials are the third-largest sector in the S&P 500, they could be a harbinger of the rest of the market.The biggest ETFs focused on financials are $15.71 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), down 5.41% year to date, $3.71 billion Vanguard Financials (VFH) -4.48% and $2.25 billion SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) down 10.25%.The headwinds facing the sector are strong. They include low interest rates and a flat yield curve, leading to slim interest margins, which make up a big part of a bank's earnings. Throw in slumping merger-and-acquisition activity, underreserved loans to the energy sector, higher capital reserve requirements and weaker trading revenue and it adds up to declining return on equity.""Earnings expectations have come in,"" said David George, senior banking analyst at Robert W. Baird. ""Given how poorly the stocks have done, the expectations are reasonable.""JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender by assets kicked off the proceedings Wednesday. Kicking off big banks’ earnings season, the New York-based lender’s Q1 earnings fell 7% to $1.35 a share, beating consensus estimates by 9 cents. Revenue slipped 3% to $24.1 billion, above forecasts of $23.4 billion.Investors were happy to see net income beat the consensus estimate. JPMorgan's shares surged 4%. The news sparked a rally in the financial sector.Have the banks bottomed out? Is this the beginning of a rally or just a head fake?""There are very few positives today except for the pure valuation,"" said Mark DeVaul, co-portfolio manager of Touchstone Large Cap Fund (TLCIX)). ""JPMorgan's earnings weren't great, but expectations were so low the stock went up.""Touchstone Large Cap had nearly 25% of its $302.8 million assets in financial services stocks as of Dec. 31.Of the four other big banks, the fund owns Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), but not Citibank (C). He said both Bank of America and Wells look cheap compared to their long-term history.""The near-term environment is terrible, but it's hard to imagine it getting worse,"" said DeVaul. ""If you buy banks when there is a lot of near-term negativity, that provides strong downside protection, especially if they have strong balance sheets.""It's very interesting that the failure of the big banks to pass the regulators' ""living wills"" test had no effect on the rally, said Paul DeSisto, senior portfolio manager at M&R Capital Management a New York-based registered investment advisor.
"
500,WFC,"DeSisto said the continuation of a rally depends oil prices increasing, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, and weaker wage increases, but all this is unlikely in an election year.""I expect the rally to be short-lived,"" said DeSisto. ""But I see limited downside. Patient investors who buy now and hold until after the election, may be well rewarded.""The banks haven't bottomed out,"" countered Sid Jain, president of AAAUM, an investment advisor in Hoboken, N.J. Jain worries about the Fed pushing interest rates negative like Europe and Japan. He said there's a 15% chance of it happening. But if it does, it will shock the stock market.
"
501,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM) first-quarter earnings Wednesday pointed to the resilience of the U.S. consumer and economy amid recent stock market turmoil.Kicking off big banks' earnings season, the New York-based lender's Q1 earnings fell 7% to $1.35 a share, beating consensus estimates by 9 cents. Revenue slipped 3% to $24.1 billion, above forecasts of $23.4 billion.But while the top and bottom lines declined, net income at JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division rose 12% to $2.5 billion. Net revenue grew 4% to $11.1 billion.Shares jumped 4.2% and lifted stocks of other bank giants. Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), which report results Thursday, added 3.9% and 2.6% respectively. Citigroup (C), which reports Friday, surged 5.6%. Investment banking heavyweight Morgan Stanley (MS) popped 5.3% and rival Goldman Sachs (GS) added 3.6%.JPMorgan's lending during the January-to-March period surged 11% to $847.3 billion, powered by strength in auto loans, credit cards and commercial lending. Excluding credit cards, consumer loans gained 16%, suggesting that the consumer's appetite for spending and borrowing was undeterred by a tumultuous equities markets.""Total loan growth was unbelievably strong,"" said Erik Oja, an equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That bodes well for global banks.""Q1 usually is banks' strongest in terms of trading, but the horrific start to the year for stocks had Wall Street bracing for a disastrous quarter. In February, JPMorgan warned of a 20% plunge in trading revenue.But on Wednesday, the bank said fixed-income trading revenue notched a 13% drop, thanks to trading stabilizing in March.Still, there is room for caution as stocks have experienced two sharp downturns over the last 12 months. If the trading environment stabilizes, as JPMorgan has indicated, banks should do well enough through the remainder of 2016, analysts said. And the bank overall looks to continue building on its gains.""They’re still serving clients. They’re still growing loans. They’re still doing well in a number of segments,"" said Shannon Stemm, an equity analyst at Edward Jones.The Federal Reserve's decision last December to boost interest rates for the first time since 2006 also helped. JPMorgan's net interest income rose 1% to $11.7 billion, mostly driven by strong loan growth and the impact of higher interest rates on cash. Reported expenses fell 3% and head count declined 2% to 237,420 employees.On the downside, the bank nearly doubled its loan loss reserve to $1.8 billion, including $529 million for nonperforming energy loans and $162 million in mining and metal loans.Compared to other big banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, JPMorgan is more exposed to those sectors. Though crude oil has rallied to $41 per barrel from February's low of $26 per barrel, natural gas, mining and metals remain subdued.Despite the mounting losses, big banks are considered large enough and sufficiently diversified to endure the energy bust.Meanwhile, regulators at the FDIC and the Fed ordered JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) to make significant changes to their ""living wills,"" or their detailed bankruptcy plans required under the Dodd-Frank Act.For now, the regulators' findings are expected to be a speed bump and not much more.""We expect all these firms to aggressively address their short comings,"" wrote Jason Goldberg, a Barclays analyst, in a Wednesday note. ""We do not expect material changes to operations or costs.""

502,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning that fell less than expected as consumer gains mitigated investment banking trouble. The lifted shares of JPMorgan and rivals such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which all release Q1 results later this week.JPMorgan Chase earned $1.35 a share, down 7% from $1.45 a year earlier and the first decline in five quarters. Revenue fell to $24.08 billion vs. $24.82 billion a year earlier.The largest U.S. bank was expected to report Q1 earnings per share of $1.26 a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was expected to fall about 5% to $23.4 billion.""We delivered solid results this quarter with strong underlying drivers,"" CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""The consumer businesses continue to grow loans and deposits impressively, attracting deposits faster than the industry. The U.S. consumer remains healthy and consumer credit trends are favorable.""The bank's consumer and community banking division reported a 12% rise in net income and 4% gain in revenue.JPMorgan shares rose 4.2% on the stock market today to a 3-month high.JPMorgan nearly doubled loan loss reserves to $1.8 billion from $959 million a year earlier. That included $529 million for energy loans and $162 million in metal and mining loans. It February the bank said  that it planned to boost reserves for potential loan losses by $500 million for energy companies and $100 million for mining and metals.Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup all have large outstanding loans, though most analysts have said banking giants have plenty of capital to absorb energy-related loan losses. Banks also have been cutting credit lines to oil and gas exploration and production companies to limit exposure, though that could create hardship in the oil patch.JPMorgan also said banking revenue fell 19%, with investment banking revenue down 24%. The bank had said previously that investment-banking fee revenue was likely to fall 25%, with trading revenue off 20%.But fixed-income trading revenue ended up down just 13% in Q1. JPMorgan said that trading stabilized in March and so far this month.Citigroup has said trading revenue would likely fall 15%.Separately, the Federal Reserve and FDIC said that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BofA, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) must make significant changes to their ""living wills."" Major banks were required to submit detailed bankruptcy plans as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. Meanwhile, the Fed on its own said that Goldman Sachs' (GS) living will fell short, while the FDIC on its own did not favor Morgan Stanley (MS). Citigroup did pass, despite ""shortcomings.""Bank of America stock popped 3.9%, Wells Fargo 2.6% and Citigroup 5.6%. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which report earnings early next week, climbed 3.6% and 5.3%, respectively.

504,WFC,"The stock market rallied nicely at the open Wednesday as overseas factors, earnings reports and economic data all influenced early trade.The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.7% each.The stock market today benefited from a positive mood started in Asia. China's March exports surged 12% from a a year ago, the first rise in eight months, according to the General Administration of Customs. Imports declined less than 8%, vs. a 14% drop in February. The export improvement was partially due to a sharp drop in exports in March 2015. Strong exports were also helped by a weaker yuan.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index responded with a 3.2% gain. The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.4%. In Japan, the yen continued lower against the dollar, helping send the Nikkei 225 ahead 2.8%.The positive tone carried over into Europe, where markets pushed strong gains in afternoon trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX traded up more than 2% each. London's FTSE 100 showed a 1.4% gain.The overseas momentum helped compensate for the drag caused by oil and gold, both of which traded briskly lower. West Texas Intermediate traded down 1%, but held firmly above $41 a barrel. Gold futures were off nearly 1% to $1,250 an ounce.In U.S. economic news, inflation received a tame report card, as producer prices eased 0.1% in March, the Labor Department estimated, well below the 0.3% increase expected by consensus forecasts. Declines in cost of services apparently offset rebounding energy prices. Core prices, minus energy and food, also dipped 0.1%, vs. forecasts for a 0.2% increase.Retail sales also dropped in March, down 0.3%, Commerce Department data showed. Consensus expectations called for a 0.1% increase. Minus automobiles, sales rose 0.2% -- below the consensus estimate for a 0.4% gain.The Census Bureau offers up February business inventories data at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report at 10:30. The Federal Reserve's beige book report is due out at 2 p.m.JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) paced the Dow in the early going, rising 3% each.JPMorgan outperformed after its Q1 report showed earnings and revenue falling less than anticipated. JPMorgan's Q1 results showed consumer and community banking growing net income 12% on a 4% rise in revenue. Investment banking revenue dropped 24%.Other banks tapped into the momentum. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) -- all scheduled to report results on Thursday -- rose 2% apiece. Overseas banks were also in serious motion: Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) leapt 6%, London-based HSBC Holdings (HSBC) swung up 5%. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyd's Banking Group (LYG) and UBS Group (UBS) all climbed 3%.Among other companies reporting quarterly results, Adtran (ADTN) jumped 4% after a positive report late Tuesday. Railroad CSX (CSX) rose 1%, as revenue missed and earnings just met analyst consensus estimates, but management reported firmer pricing and rising volumes in automotive and other segments.Beyond earnings, biotech drug maker Medivation (MDVN) sparked up 8% after Bloomberg reported the company had snubbed a buyout offer from French drug giant Sanofi (SNY). Shares of Sanofi added 0.6%.China's Baidu (BIDU) and JD.Com (JD) led the Nasdaq 100, up 3% and 4% respecitively. S&P 500 name Harley Davidson (HOG) rebounded 3.5%. The stock tanked 14% last week on a string of critical analyst notes.Early IBD 50 leaders included Facebook (FB). Shares added more than 1%. The social networking heavy found quiet support at its 50-day line on Tuesday, ending 6% below a 117.09 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX) added 2% after Tuesday's gap down in heavy trade. The stock managed to find support at the converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. That is a positive, but shares have been unable to rise clear of those lines of support as they've climbed the right side of a shallow six-month consolidation.

505,WFC,"Even as Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO John Stumpf faced a grilling from the Senate on Tuesday about employees' alleged sales misconduct -- along with questions on Twitter (TWTR) about his bandaged right hand -- analysts appeared to remain bullish on the bank in the longer term, even if profits suffer through next year and regulations tighten.""Yes, we could see more volatility ahead as headline risk persists, but Wells is rarely this inexpensive,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said of Wells Fargo's shares in a note on Tuesday upgrading the stock.Morgan Stanley upgraded Wells Fargo stock to overweight from equal-weight but cut its price target to 53 from 56.That stock, which finished up 1.2% in the stock market today, has tumbled this month after Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $185 million fine to regulators following accusations that its employees created up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to jolt sales figures and hit sales targets.Wells fired 5,300 workers in connection with the matter, and the bank reportedly faces a Justice Department investigation.Still, the scrutiny of the bank's sales practices was unlikely to threaten Wells' dividend, Graseck wrote.""WFC has received no objection from the Fed on its 2016 (capital plan), and the recent $185M fine had no material impact on EPS (<1%),"" she said.Morgan Stanley said the fallout should cost Wells Fargo 4 cents, or 1%, worth of full-year estimated earnings per share in 2016. Morgan Stanley also cut its 2017 EPS target by 3% to $4.10 because of the situation.""Additional fines are likely to be limited as Wells booked very little revenue from the opening of unauthorized accounts ($2.5-5.0M in total), hired a 3rd party to review its entire system, paid a fine that was more than 30x the revenues generated, and is changing its compensation system for its consumer bankers.""But growth in credit-card fees and deposit service charges was likely to slow as the company does away with sales goals and adjusts incentives, she said.Stumpf on Tuesday told the Senate Banking Committee that he was ""deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill on our responsibility to our customers, to our team members, and to the American public.""""Wrongful sales practice behavior in our retail banking business goes against everything regarding our core principals, our ethics and our culture,"" he said.He said the bank ""never directed, nor wanted our team members to provide products and services to customers that they did not want."" Stumpf said management first learned of the fake accounts in 2013, and said they should have taken care of the matter earlier.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was not impressed.""You should resign, you should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"" she said.Earlier, Warren questioned Stumpf about the company's cross-selling practices -- or getting customers to use more of the bank's products. Stumpf, before Warren cut him off, said that cross-selling was ""shorthand for deepening relationships.""Holding up a thick stack of papers, Warren then offered select quotes from what she said were transcripts of 12 quarterly earnings calls from 2012 to 2014 in which management touted record cross-selling in Wells' retail banking segment. The sales tactics in question allegedly date back to 2011.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a research note last week said they believe Wells Fargo shares were ""nearing a bottom of the relative underperformance"" and that they were trading at a discount.""Based on past incidences at high-quality banks, the overhang on valuation from scandals can last 3 to 10 months based on the severity of the negative actions,"" analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a research note dated Sept. 15.""We would characterize Wells Fargo as being on the low-end of the severity in terms of potential losses,"" he continued, ""but the company would be near the high end for reputational damage given management's position that they are not a Wall Street bank so improper activity is less expected.""KBW also noted that Wells' cross-selling scandal, for now, had cost the bank some 0.07% of its overall market-cap value. That was far less than JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) ""London Whale"" derivative debacle, the losses UBS (UBS) suffered after its ""rogue trader"" scandal, Barclays' (BCS) LIBOR-rigging scandal or Volkswagen's (VLKAY) emissions-cheating, the firm said.IBD's TAKE: As Wells Fargo becomes the latest bank in recent years to face a financial scandal, other bank stocks have traded more tightly as Wall Street speculates whether the Federal Reserve will decide to hike rates this year. See more detail about which bank stocks might be in buy range. KBW analyst Brian Gardner, in a separate note, said the cross-selling scandal would affect the banking industry into next year. He added that the incident could kill congressional efforts to modify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's powers, raise the probability that lawmakers will try to break up the biggest banks, and affect executive compensation.""At some point we would expect Wells' CEO to fall on the sword by forgoing compensation and trying to clawback compensation where possible,"" Kleinhanzl wrote in his note last week. ""To us, that seems a path that is most palatable to investors.""Shares of JPMorgan edged up 0.4%, while UBS dipped 0.9%. Bank of America (BAC) added less than 0.1%, and Citigroup (C) eased 0.1%. Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 0.2%, and Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 0.3%.RELATED:Where Do Millennials Bank?

507,WFC,"Traders bracing for a heated U.S. presidential debate tonight had another element to contend with — a sell-off in global banks.Equities wiped out their monthly advance as Deutsche Bank (DB) tumbled to a record low on speculation that Germany's largest lender would need to raise capital. Treasury yields declined toward the lowest level in almost three weeks, while the yen led gains among its Group-of-10 peers. Emerging-market shares slumped after Turkey's credit rating was cut to junk by Moody's Investors Service. Oil surged as Saudi Arabia's offer to cut output opened the door to a future OPEC deal.Investors piled into safer assets as Deutsche Bank's plunge spurred a rout in global financial companies on concern the lender is struggling with tougher capital standards, negative interest rates and soaring legal bills. Havens were also in demand as traders awaited the first of three U.S. presidential debates ahead of the Nov. 8 election and a Bloomberg poll showed Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton deadlocked. Citigroup, which last month said that a Republican victory could lead to equity declines, warned Monday that such an event could cause heightened volatility in both gold and currency markets.""There's a fear factor in the market that's very sizable and it's in the market overseas,"" Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles in Boston, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""It's people hedging as to what on God's earth is going to come out of this U.S. election. That's the concern.""Tonight's event at Hofstra University in New York starts at 9 p.m. local time and will mark the first time that voters see the major-party nominees on the same stage. The Republican and Democratic nominees each get 46% of likely voters in a head-to-head contest in the latest Bloomberg Politics national poll, while Trump gets 43% to Clinton's 41% when third-party candidates are included.The MSCI All-Country World index fell 1% at 4 p.m. in New York, heading toward a 0.1% decline in September. The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 1.6%, its biggest slide since early July, while the S&P 500 index slipped 0.8% to 2,146.42.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) led losses in U.S. financial shares, while Deutsche Bank sank 7.5%. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government sees ""no grounds"" for speculation over state funding for the lender, her chief spokesman said, pushing back against a magazine report that the German leader has ruled out any such aid.""The negative implications of what's happening at Deutsche Bank are weighing on sentiment,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.A measure of emerging-market stocks slumped 1.4% as Turkish shares led losses among the world's biggest equity markets.Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.58%, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.""U.S. politics are moving right to center stage,"" said Rene Albrecht, a rates and derivatives analyst at DZ Bank in Frankfurt. ""There are rising uncertainties about the effects of the election results. And when you got uncertainty, you better rotate out of stocks and into safe havens.""German 10-year bund yields fell four basis points to minus 0.12%, extending a drop of nine basis points from last week. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds retreated three basis points to 1.18%, while the yield for similar maturity Spanish debt slid five basis points to 0.9%.Mario Draghi said euro-area governments must act to stem rising public discontent, in his latest warning to politicians that the European Central Bank can't sustain the region's recovery alone. The central bank's program to buy 80 billion euros ($90 billion) a month of debt faces scarcity concerns and its negative interest rates have prompted criticism by banks and savers.""Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation,"" Draghi said. ""Other policy actors need to do their part, pursuing fiscal and structural policies which will contribute to a self-sustaining recovery and increase the economic growth potential of the euro area.""

509,WFC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) saw second-quarter net earnings rise 25% to $5 billion, or about $2.03 per Class B share, a penny above estimates.The conglomerate late Friday said revenue grew 6% to $54.46 billion, though total revenue was lighter than analyst consensus for $56.44 billion. Revenue from Berkshire's flagship insurance businesses climbed 9.9% to $43.59 billion.""Our insurance underwriting operations generated increased net earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to 2015,"" management said in a regulatory filing.That reflected foreign-exchange rate fluctuation for Berkshire's reinsurance activities overseas, as well as an increase in underwriting gains for its Geico business, partly offset by lower gains from General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group operations.Berkshire saw a 10.3% drop in its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad revenue to $8.85 billion, down from $9.87 billion in the second quarter of 2015, as railroads continue to be slammed by lower shipments of petroleum, coal and other products.IBD'S TAKE: While Berkshire Hathaway and other large diversified manufacturers have generally reported middling results, smaller rivals have outperformed the market. To find out which companies in the group are the highest rated, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Berkshire earlier in the year made a roughly $1 billion investment in Apple (AAPL) at a time when sales of its iPhone seemed to be slowing. However, in its July 26 earnings report, Apple reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales, driving its stock up nearly 7% on July 27. Other core Berkshire holdings include Coca-Cola (KO), Wells Fargo (WFC) and oil and gas refiner Phillips 66 (PSX).But Berkshire's investment in Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell to $15.75 billion as of June 30 from $23.42 billion on Dec. 31, the company said in its 10-Q statement. Since the beginning of the year, Berkshire's total shareholders' equity has increased $7.5 billion.Berkshire's Class B shares dipped 0.1% to 145.56 in the stock market today. Its stock dropped to a 2016 low of 123.55 on Feb. 3, in sync with the early-year market pullback, and then turned up. It's risen 19% since then and was trading above both its 10-week average and its 200-day line.Apple rose 0.8% to 108.37. Kraft Heinz fell 4 cents to 88.75 after climbing 3.8% Friday on strong earnings.
"
510,WFC,"Deutsche Bank (DB) won't be profitable this year, its co-chief executive said at a London conference, and even warned that the German bank may suffer a ""small loss"" in 2016.""We’ve said this year is not going to be a profitable year, we may make a small profit, we may make a small loss, we don’t know,"" co-CEO John Cryan said at the conference, according to Bloomberg.Under Cryan's leadership, Deutsche Bank has axed thousands of positions, eliminated its dividend for last year and this year, and has sold off assets. And they've been hurt by penalties such as the $2.5 billion settlement it agreed to pay over rate-rigging and the $258 million settlement it paid to U.S. regulators for doing business with sanctioned nations such as Iran, Syria and Libya.Last year, Deutsche Bank reported an annual loss of $7 billion, its first annual loss since 2008.The bank's U.S. shares closed down 4.2% on the stock market today.But Deutsche Bank's problems apparently didn't weigh on stocks of big U.S. banks as they experienced an upsurge in buying early Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dipped 0.5%, Wells Fargo (WFC) lost 0.9% and Bank of America (BAC) fell 1.9%.Among top European banks, Barclays (BCS) rose 0.6% and Banco Santander (SAN) fell 1%. HSBC (HSBC), Europe's largest bank, rose 0.7%.Credit Suisse (CS) shares fell 4.4% after lawyers for Georgia's former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, filed a legal complaint in Switzerland related to money laundering allegations, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, fellow Switzerland-based banking giant UBS (UBS) plans to cut about 300 of its European investment banking jobs in the coming weeks, Reuters reported. UBS shares dropped 4.6%.Market volatility has hurt banks so far this year, with JPMorgan and Bank of America cutting investment banking jobs in recent months. In January, Barclays said it would cut about 1,000 investment banking jobs.
"
511,WFC,"Shares of big banks all fell in response to the Federal Reserve slashing projections for future interest rate hikes, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) all finished lower Wednesday.In December, the central bank raised a key interest rate to 0.25%-0.5%, the first increase since 2006, and Fed officials such as Chair Janet Yellen talked about four rate hikes this year. On Wednesday, not only did the Fed pass on another rate hike, but implied just two quarter-point hikes to the federal funds rate this year.Markets still only see 1 rate hike in 2016, with the timing pushed back from June to September.The muted expectations are the result of a struggling global economy, a battered energy sector and stock market turmoil to start the year. Though the markets generally cheered the news, banks did not. JPMorgan shares fell 0.5% to 58.92 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo and Citigroup each tumbled 0.9%, Bank of America fell 1.9%,  U.S. Bancorp (USB) 0.6% and Goldman 1%.Bank of America fell back below its 50-day moving average after retaking that line last Friday. But JPMorgan, Wells, Citi and U.S. Bancorp held above that support level. Goldman found resistance just below the  50-day line.The lower-for-longer interest rate environment has cut into banks' net interest margins, a key measure of their profitability. It gauges the difference between what banks earn from interest paid to them from loans versus the interest banks pay out to depositors. The longer interest rates remain low, the more net interest margins get squeezed and the less profitable banks become.Coupled with squeezed margins is the lousy start to the year for banks' trading revenue. JPMorgan forecast a 20% drop in trading revenue in Q1. Citigroup said its trading revenue will drop 25% this quarter.Adding to the bad news are the nonperforming loans to energy companies, hurt badly by the collapse of crude oil prices since June 2014. JPMorgan boosted its Q1 energy loan loss reserves to $1.5 billion while Wells Fargo set aside $1.2 billion for potential losses in its energy loan portfolio. Morgan Stanley says 40% of its hefty energy loan portfolio are junk rated.Layoffs at Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley (MS) have hurt too. 
"
512,WFC,"Total mortgage applications rose a meager 0.2% as purchase applications and refinancings moved in opposite directions, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.The purchase index rose 4.2% for the week ended March 4 and notched a 30% gain compared to the same period a year earlier. Demand for refinancing fell 2.3% last week, following losses of 7% or more in each of the prior two weeks, but they remained 13% higher than a year earlier.The average interest rate for 30-year conforming loans ($417,000 or less) climbed six basis points to 3.89%.Since the Federal Reserve raised its target federal funds rate in December, additional interest rate hikes in the short term are no longer considered likely. Central banks in Sweden and Japan have got into negative rate territory -- as has the European Central Bank, which is expected to cut its negative rate further on Thursday.Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC), a major mortgage lender, fell 0.5% on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) climbed 0.6%. Wells Fargo and and JPMorgan rose above their 50-day moving averages intraday, but Wells fell back below that level. Bank of America is tracking slightly below that downward-sloping line. All three are still down sharply in 2016 and well of their July peaks.As for homebuilders, D.R. Horton (DHI) rose 1.3%, and LGI Homes (LGIH) shot up 9.7%.D.R. Horton found resistance at its 200-day line late last week and is trying to stay above its 50-day average.LGI Homes on Wednesday reported that quarterly earnings more than doubled, topping views. Shares, which had tumbled last Friday to the 50-day line, briefly reclaimed their 200-day average intraday.
"
513,WFC,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett's bet with a hedge fund may show that all you need is the pastoral eminence known as the S&P 500 -- rather than the fancy approach such funds use to beat the market.Buffett's 10-year bet that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX), an S&P 500 index fund, could outperform five funds of hedge funds selected by Protege Partners appears to be paying off, says Fortune, which has followed the bet since first reporting on it in 2008.Protege's five funds of hedge funds rose 1.7% on average last year, in contrast to the 1.36% gain that the Vanguard fund brought in. However, Fortune notes, the Vanguard fund has gained 65.67% over the bet's first eight years, which include 2015, compared to 21.87% on average for the Protege funds of funds.Berkshire Hathaway's class B shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today and are up 5% so far this year. The S&P 500 is down about 2.9% for 2016.The Berkshire Hathaway chief's hunch appears to be backed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which said Wednesday that most small-, mid- and large-cap managers have been underperforming S&P indexes.Last year, 66.11% of large-cap managers, 56.81% of midcap managers and 72.2% of small-cap managers underperformed the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600, respectively.Over five years, 84.15% of large-cap managers, 76.69% of midcap managers and 90.13% of small-cap managers lagged their respective benchmarks. And over 10 years, 82.14% of large-cap managers, 87.61% of midcap managers and 88.42% of small-cap managers failed to outperform.But if Warren Buffett is so smart, why not just invest like the legendary ""Sage of Omaha""?Berkshire Hathaway's top stock holdings include American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), and he has built up his position in Phillips 66 (PSX) in recent months.Many investors do try to mimic Berkshire Hathaway's investments, but Buffett thinks that's a bad idea.“I wouldn’t ever urge them to do anything based on what we do. If they want to do what Berkshire does, then they should buy Berkshire,” Buffett told CNBC last month. “I think they’re making a big mistake by piggybacking me or 10 other people whose names appear in the paper.”
"
514,WFC,"The rough start to the year for banks, with subpar fourth-quarter earnings and a continuously tough revenue environment, could make mergers among regional, midtier and small banks more likely, Fitch Ratings said.Large regional banks have outperformed their smaller peers, but returns remain lackluster, still below pre-crisis levels, Fitch said in a statement. Regulatory and compliance costs, continuously low interest rates and the need to invest in new technology will continue to weigh on banks' earnings in the near future.Shareholder pressure for better returns may lead to more mergers, though depressed stock prices may prevent some deals going ahead, the ratings agency said. The average return on equity across the banking industry during the fourth quarter of 2015 was 9%, compared with nearly 13% during the first quarter of 2006.Banks generally underwhelmed in the fourth quarter and things aren't expected to get much better during this quarter. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) already has warned that it expects trading revenue to tumble 20% this quarter as stocks were pummeled by a horrible start to the year.JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have given serious boosts to their energy loan-loss reserves as low oil prices have boosted the numbers of nonperforming loans in the energy sector. JPMorgan alone has boosted its loan-loss reserves to $1.5 billion in the first quarter.Also, near-zero interest rates and the unlikelihood of the Federal Reserve to immediately boost them further is cutting into banks' net interest margins, a key gauge of profitability that measures the difference between what they charge in loans and what they pay out to depositors.""We do not think interest rate hikes will provide much uplift to overall bank earnings in 2016 as the operating environment remains challenging,"" Fitch noted. ""M&A could lead to cost savings, which could support earnings.""But given the political pressure on big banks, it's unlikely they'll be candidates for mergers and acquisitions. Bank mergers last quarter included Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY) agreeing to purchase Buffalo, N.Y.-based First Niagara Financial Group (FNFG) for $4.1 billion, and New York Community Bancorp  (NYCB) agreeing to buy Astoria Financial (AF) for $2 billion.

515,WFC,"Banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are expected to report poor earnings this week as market turmoil hits investment banking and trading. But investors may pay more attention to banks' massive loans to now-embattled energy companies.Even though oil prices have rebounded from early 2016 lows, cash-flow woes persist for many shale companies that bet big when crude was trading at $100 a barrel. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and several other banks already have set aside more funds for potential energy-loan losses. A key question is how much they will raise loan loss provisions now.Fitch Ratings, in an analysis released Tuesday, said that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will classify many high-yield loans to oil and gas exploration and production companies as Criticized -- specifically, as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss.Justin Fuller, Fitch's senior director of financial institutions, said that the troubles could worsen if nonbank lenders step in and buy Criticized loans, in which case ""banks may see losses crystallize, given the low bid prices on some loans and uncertainty around oil prices.""Meanwhile, banks continue to set aside billions in reserves to cover losses related to bad energy loans, Barclays said.""The noise surrounding energy-related provisions trends in 1Q '16 reached deafening levels across the banking industry when JPM announced at its Investor Day on February 23 that it planned to add about $500 million to its oil & gas related reserve in 1Q '16,"" bringing its total up to about $1.3 billion, Barclays said in an April 1 report.JPMorgan's late February announcement that it would hike energy loan loss reserves was followed by Comerica (CMA), which disclosed in a regulatory filing that if current conditions persist, an estimated additional provision of $75 million to $125 million could result.Morgan Stanley (MS) on Feb. 23 said in an SEC filing that it has $15.9 billion in energy-related loans outstanding. Morgan Stanley added that 60% of the loans are investment grade, implying that 40% were junk-rated. Morgan Stanley reports earnings on April 18.Wells Fargo, which reports earnings Thursday, set aside $1.2 billion for energy-loan losses in Q4. It has $17.4 billion in energy loans, with $24 billion in untapped credit lines.Bank of America has about $21 billion in energy-related loans and about the same amount in credit lines yet to be drawn down. Bank of America also reports earnings Thursday.Citigroup (C) also has $21 billion in energy loans and $37 billion in credit lines yet to be tapped. Citigroup reports earnings on Friday.JPMorgan reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares closed up 1.85% on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. The stock fell to a 52.50 low on Feb. 11 before turning up, but it is still below its 200-day average.Wells Fargo stock rose 1.6%, Morgan Stanley 1.95%, Citigroup 1.9% and Bank of America 2.3%. All are below their 200-day lines.Fitch said that many energy companies with high levels of cash-flow and balance-sheet leverage are at risk of default. ""Classified risk ratings from the OCC could amplify the pain that many leverage E&P borrowers are already feeling,"" Fitch Senior Director of Leveraged Finance Sharon Bonelli said in the report.""However,"" Fitch offered in a positive caveat, ""most large banks have manageable exposure to energy loans, averaging just 23% of tangible common equity in Fitch's portfolio.""

516,WFC,"It is POST TIME! That time defined as the 'specific time' when the race begins.....when all participants need to be locked and loaded in the narrow gates awaiting the starters call......Yes folks - its RACE day or rather RACE month....when the CEO's & CFO's must confess the financial condition of publicly traded companies....and on each race day - the grooms - in this case the IR guy/gal leads the 'horse' to the 'saddling paddock'. The identifier checks the horse's identity (listed company) to make sure that the results correspond with the proper 'horse'. Then the horse is saddled up and the jockeys (usually the CFO) are given instructions on how to proceed. The jockey adorned in the 'silks' of the horse's owner ( in this case the CEO) are given instructions on how to proceed and together the jockey and the owner take their places....And they are OFF!Last night - post close - we got the first taste of what is expected to be a tough race.....Alcoa (AA) comes out of the gate stumbling....1Q earnings of .07 cts/sh were down 92%, Yes - earnings BEAT the estimate but top line revenues missed big time......coming in at $4.95 bil vs. the expectation of $5.20 bil....... Klaus Kleinfeld (CEO) discussed weak aluminum prices (down 40% over the last 5 yrs) and the state of the global economy.....2000 jobs are on the line because of weak mkts around the world......The stock fell 4% in after hours trading and is currently trading at $9.34 down 0.40 cts off of last night's close....'and so it was written' the season has begun.....'Stocks popped at the open but the rally was short-lived....stocks failed to sustain the early upside spike and stocks turned lower...sellers dominating the day and selling into the rally. The pullback attributed to the beginning of what is predicted to be a disappointing earnings season.What also added to the sour mood was the double secret meeting between Yellen and the Fed governors. Following this surprise expedited meeting, Janet Yellen met with President Obama to discuss the state of the economy. Now just an FYI - this was the first time since November 2014 that the sitting Fed chair has met one on one with the president....and the media was not invited...so what did they discuss? Rate hike - nah, GDP - maybe, the real unemployment rate? Doubtful - as Obama thinks it's all a bed of roses.....How about the state of the banking industry and how the global contraction has affected the industry....How about the quality of assets, how about margin compression and growth prospects in this less than stellar environment....... especially after two central banks - the ECB and the BoJ initiated negative interest rates. Oh boy.....so much to say....Now as discussed - we are expecting earnings to be down y/y - and as of the end of March - that number has been 'adjusted' to -8.5%....(slight improvement...) Energy, financials and industrials to take the brunt of the blame...... this will be the 4th straight qtr of EPS (Earnings per share) declines....but do not be concerned.....because as usual - expect to see 70% of those earnings 'beat the estimates' - but like Alcoa - will they beat due to cost cutting or will they actually GROW top line revenues? The jury is still out - but my money says - the majority of the 'beats' will come from 'expense management' vs organic growth.....Today we get a bit of a reprieve before the financials line up in the starting gate.....Wednesday - look for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) followed by the usual suspects - Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank Of America (BAC)..... Will weak earnings be discounted? Are we really expecting that 'hockey stick' recovery in the second half of 2016? And if so then this is a gift for the longer term investor...because if this as bad as it gets - then future action can only be UP......unless of course the mkt does not believe it and the guidance is less than stellar.....Now the VIX - is giving us a whole different storyline.....this index (otherwise known as the FEAR Index) - has fallen to a 7 month low.... What its telling us is that the mkts are not concerned about almost anything at the moment and some of the industry's recent surveys confirm this lack of concern.......The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) reveals that pessimism is at a 5 month low of 32.2% - well below the historical average of 39%. Bank of America's ""Bull & Bear"" index recently surged to 4.1, up dramatically from the March low of 0.1......,suggesting the most bullish reading in 9 months. So when everyone is so bullish - what's left??? But buyer beware....this can change in a heartbeat - as any number of things could cause a change in psychology....or sentiment.Yes - it's all nice when everyone plays nice on the jungle gym....but as soon as we get something unexpected then we could see a rather swift and painful sell off...Remember - as I have pointed out - the next two months is traditionally weak and with the US in the middle of a nasty presidential election cycle - so much can happen that will change the direction of the conversation.Risk remains high.....FED policy is uncertain and if the FED is forced to raise rates too quickly - then prepare for the massacre, Europe's economy is on the edge, China is slowing, a Yuan devaluation is NOT out of the question, negative interest rates causing concern around the globe, and continued currency wars and the geopolitical risks of terrorism, war and immigration could easily ignite mkt volatility and are only a few of the risks that exist.US futures are higher by 5pts this morning - no matter what the Alcoa earnings say.....The mkt remains stuck in the 2040/2070 range but feels a bit heavier each day.....a decisive break below 2040 will take us back to support at 2014. Remember - the underlying tone of the mkt is suspect at best......Bank earnings are now the next big thing for investors to watch and mkts to digest.We have 3 FED speeches today....Philly's Patrick Harker at 9 am, San Fran's John Williams at 3 pm, and Richmond's Jeffrey Lacker at 4 pm. Can't wait to hear what prophetic words are on the teleprompter....How will mkts react or have the mkts now decided that all of this FED speak is just noise?Take Good Care

519,WFC,"The horrendous start to the first quarter for stocks, coupled with losses in energy and commodities, is expected to kick bank earnings in the teeth as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and others report this week.Plunging oil prices in January and February sent the market into a tailspin, lodging its worst-ever start to the year. Accordingly, a weak environment for trading and capital markets is expected to hurt banks. JPMorgan and Citigroup (C) are among the lenders who have issued warnings on trading revenue.JPMorgan, which reports Wednesday, is expected to see its earnings decline 13% to $1.26 a share, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue is expected to fall 5.5% from a year earlier to $23.4 billion. The New York-based bank’s shares tumbled 10.3% during the first quarter.In February, the nation's largest bank warned that its trading revenue should decline 20% in the quarter. The drop in trading revenue is expected to be exacerbated by the surge of the Swiss franc in January 2015, resulting in tough year-over-year comparisons. But CEO Jamie Dimon said at the time that improved market conditions in March could help.Dimon himself helped out in February, when he bought $26 million of JPMorgan shares.The bank also boosted its energy loan-loss reserves by $500 million for the quarter, though oil prices have rebounded somewhat since falling below $27 a barrel earlier in the quarter.Bank of America, which reports Thursday, is seen earning 21 cents a share in Q1, down 22% from a year earlier, while its revenue is expected to decline 5.2% to $20.4 billion. The Charlotte, N.C.-based lender’s shares plunged 20% in Q1.Q1 typically is the strongest quarter of the year, but weak trading and investment banking revenue this year ""would set up for a tough operating environment through the rest of 2016,"" according to Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, in a research note last week.Wells Fargo (WFC), which is also slated to report on Thursday, is expected to earn 97 cents a share, down 6.7%. But revenue is expected to grow a modest 1.6% to $21.6 billion. Its stock slipped 11% in Q1.The San Francisco-based bank focuses more on lending to consumers and businesses. As a result, it isn't quite as exposed to stock market fluctuations as some of its rivals.But Wells Fargo set aside $1.2 billion last quarter for nonperforming energy loans.Also looming overhead is the constant concern over how many times the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year. After December's 0.25 percentage-point increase, some Fed officials talked about four hikes in 2016. But the stock market's gyrations, coupled with weak overseas economic growth, has led some to speculate that there will be two rate hikes -- or maybe even none.In a healthy economy, higher interest rates help boost banks' net interest margins, a key measure of profitability. A bank's net interest margin is the difference between the interest it pays out to depositors and the interest it charges borrowers.""We want to see higher rates for the right reasons,"" said Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""If the economy is strong enough to handle higher rates, that’s good news for the banks as well.""Analysts at Barclays said they're closely watching Wells Fargo's mortgage activity. UBS analysts last month rated Wells Fargo a sell, arguing that its portfolio is tilted toward risky energy and auto loans. Most analysts remain positive on Wells Fargo.Citigroup will earn $1.06 a share, a 30% decline, analysts expect. The revenue forecast is for a tumble of 11% to $17.6 billion. The New York-based bank’s stock fell 19% during Q1. Citi reports Q1 results on Friday.In March, CFO John Gerspach warned that fixed-income trading is expected to fall 15% in Q1 and investment banking revenue is seen declining 25%.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) report Q1 results next week. Both investment banks are expected to post year-over-year declines in EPS and revenue.Image provided by Shutterstock.

520,WFC,"Stocks closed positive for the 3rd consecutive week – as fresh signs that the US economy is solid - boosted by the supposed strong jobs report that surprised even the most seasoned analyst….the NFP report came in a whopping +242k jobs – or up 27% over street expectations….and at 8:30 am when the headline number hit – futures spiked higher and then sold off back to flat as reality set it….First – what kinds of jobs were they – temporary vs. full, leisure and hospitality or mining and manufacturing. Were they minimum wage jobs or were they more significant? And then – in the end - what did this strong report mean for FED policy?
"
521,WFC,"Omair Sharif - Strategist at SG America's Securities had this to say -""The latest report should dispel notions of an impending recession...it underscores a resilient economy that continues to weather global headwinds...""Underscores a resilient economy???? The report went on to reflect that wages fell from the prior month and hours worked also declined.....Sectors that employ people at higher wages also continued to 'throw them out the door' as weak commodity and energy prices weakened. But this report is likely to cause a split among FED officials.....we have some that are screaming for higher rates while others continue to take the cautious approach keeping their eyes peeled on the effects of financial turmoil on the global economy.Yes - the labor participation rate did go up ever so slightly and the service sector seems to be the place to find a job if you want one.....""labor demand is rock solid"" .......as Amhearst Pierpoint Chief Economist - Stephen Stanley let us know (rock solid? REALLY?)....and to prove this point we hear from Scott Gittrich - Pres and founder of Toppers Pizza....a Wisconsin based pizza franchise store (24 locations) .....He is looking to employ bakers, delivery men and 'other workers' and he has raised wages - although he does not indicate what those wages are - (Minimum wage in WI is $7.25/hr) and he is still having trouble getting people to work - go figure!. At the same time his is also employing new technology to eliminate workers...to become more 'efficient'......Now that is all well and good - but aren't we better off hearing from some of the S&P 500 companies that continue to 'shed high paying jobs ( by the hundreds) along with all the benefits' as they look to deal with a slowing global economy? I mean it's great to hear from the small business guy in Wisconsin - but does he represent the American dilemma?Employment is a disaster in other sectors - sectors that typically pay much higher wages,...... - Financial Services-because of choking regulation, automation and a weaker global economy- Bank Of America (BAC) is just the latest to join, Goldman Sachs (GS), Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (FBC), Deutsche Bank (DB)& Wells Fargo (WFC).....Mining - because of weak commodity prices and Manufacturing because of a stronger US dollar...Dallas Snider - 60 yrs old - who has worked at Noranda Aluminum in Missouri for over 29 yrs expects to lose his job and join the other 450 people laid off this year as the company filed for Chapter 11 - and at 60 yrs old - what hope does he have? As he said: ""Me? I'm hung out to dry...there really ain't no one that will want to hire me..."" (Go see Mr. Gittrich - he is actively looking.....)BUT - the numbers are what they are (and easily manipulated) ....the FED is not looking at the individual devastation taking place - they just look at the data- yet the data does not reveal the truth.As we pointed out early last week –it was the week where all major US equity indexes and oil finally broke above their 50-day moving averages – and this is significant. It speaks to the technical health of the mkt…..and while all of the major indexes have now pierced their initial levels of resistance – they all remain well below their 200 dma's – levels which represent a broad and significant resistance. In fact as I pointed out last week - I thought that the mkt would run into trouble at S&P 2000....as it would encounter enough resistance to send it lower.....and that is exactly what happened on Friday....we teased, we tried to pierce and we failed.This morning - we see Asian, European and US mkts coming under pressure. Over the weekend - we learned that China is now targeting a revised growth rate of 6.5 - 7% as they promise to 'do whatever it takes to achieve this growth. China rallied last night closing up 0.81%, dragging Australia with it....+1.08%, but that news did little to ignite Japan - 1% and Hong Kong - 0.08%.European mkts are all lower....as they await Thursday's ECB announcement....European banks under fire....Barclay's lower after a DB downgrade, and the Italian banks suffering over concern of more non-performing loans at Banco Populare and Intesa Sanpaolo.....the low inflation environment continues to put pressure on global banks as margins get squeezed.... So many of the stocks in the financial services have gotten beaten up, But we are starting to hear lots of chatter on the airwaves about how the sector is 'cheap'.....So pay attention....It could turn right under your nose.....In the US - futures are pointing lower - currently down 8 pts at 1986.....now to find real support you would have to go back to 1950....(probably not happening) as oil is up 1.8% this morning and we are due to hear from FED Vice Chair Fischer and FED Governor Lael Brainard later this afternoon about the state of the US economy....Expect everyone to be listening as the smart algos parse every word they say - looking for a range of definitions to support them - but can these algos' read body language or hear the intonation in their voices? Can they see the 'wink wink' or the sly smile as the speeches go on?A technical measure of the number of stocks above their 50 dma's shows that 80% of stocks are above these levels – a very rare occurrence – and one that signals short term overbought conditions.....The only way to deal with this is for the mkt to back off and churn a bit to catch up with the move.....So I expect the mkt to remain in the 1940/2000 trading range as we move into Thursday's ECB announcement - Any disappointment will give traders a reason to hit the SELL button in Europe - which then may cause some re-pricing here at home. There is no ECO data today nor anything this week that will drive the action...so expect the focus to return to global central bank policy.Take Good Care

523,WFC,"In March 2014, Steven and Bernadette Doherty paid $183,000 for a two-bedroom home in Charlotte, N.C., $6,000 more than its appraised value. Today, similar houses in the neighborhood are being priced at $300,000 or more.“We bought at the right time,” said Bernadette, a retired Wells Fargo (WFC) information technology worker. “In retrospect, we were lucky as prices have gone up so much more.”Home-price appreciation is a welcome development for households whose nest eggs were shattered by the residential real-estate bust that began a decade ago.The 2006-2009 housing slump reduced wealth by $7 trillion. Since then, the value of homeowners’ equity in real estate has more than doubled from a low in the first quarter of 2009, a recent Federal Reserve report showed. What’s more, housing wealth is poised to reach a new record as early as the second quarter, say economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Pantheon Macroeconomics.Improving property values are allowing homeowners to shake off recent stock-market volatility and keep spending. From the end of 2013 through last year’s fourth quarter, home equity climbed 22% compared with an 11% gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The stock index has declined 3% this year.“The increase in housing wealth is a kind of stealth offset to falling stock prices,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who predicts record home equity values next quarter. “Homeownership is much wider than stock ownership. The consumption effect from a given rise in holdings has been bigger for homes.”Some cities, including Charlotte, are already seeing prices at all-time highs. Home values in Dallas, Denver, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., all hit records in December, while they’re down less than 1% in Boston from an August peak, according to S&P/Case-Shiller indexes. About 38% of 87 U.S. metropolitan areas were in record territory last year, data tracker RealtyTrac figures show.The housing bust, and the resulting recession that was the worst since the 1930s, has prompted 5.6 million American households to lose homes through foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac. At it’s worse, more than a quarter of homeowners had paper losses as their mortgages exceeded the value of their properties.With some buyers having made minimal down payments, it only took small price declines to leave mortgages under water. Now, with the recovery in home values, that carnage has dissipated. Foreclosures were filed on just 95,186 properties in January, an almost 10-year low, RealtyTrac data show.Even in the worst-hit markets, home equity is being restored. Just 8.5% of properties had so-called negative equity in the fourth quarter, with debt exceeding their value, according to a report this month by consumer analytics firm CoreLogic (CLGX), while a study by Zillow (Z) put it at 13.1%.The number of homeowners with at least 20% equity is “rising rapidly,” Anand Nallathambi, president and chief executive officer of CoreLogic, said in a statement. “In 2016, we expect home equity levels to continue to build.”For all the gains, the recovery in home equity has been uneven and narrower than in the 2002-2006 housing boom, said William Emmons, senior economic advisor at the St. Louis Fed’s Center for Household Financial Stability.“The wealth from housing has shifted from a broad swath to more concentration among families who are older, better educated, higher income, white and increasingly Asian, and who live more along the coastal areas,” Emmons said.Gains have been less than complete in some of the cities that were at the center of the housing bubble.In Las Vegas, housing prices are 38% below the level reached in April 2006, according to the Case-Shiller index. Homes in Miami, Tampa and Phoenix are all fetching at least 25% less than they did at their peaks. Even so, property values in Las Vegas have recovered 61% from their low.“We don’t want to return to peak -- that was craziness here,” said Stephen Miller, economist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “The housing price recovery has been nice. What we have is a Goldilocks -- not too much, not too little.”“Underwater” homeowners are still an isolated concern. In Nevada, almost one-fifth of properties were upside down, followed by Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Among 10 large metro areas, Miami had the largest share of properties with negative equity -- about 22% in the fourth quarter, according to CoreLogic.“People are living with it, and waiting for things to get better,” said Michael Orr, real estate professor at Arizona State University in Tempe. “The market is back to stable. It was the peak that was abnormal.”Greg Zorn, a real estate investor in Naples, Fla., bought a two-bedroom duplex in 2006 for $310,000 and has rented the property for a decade. Ten years ago, Naples was ranked by IHS Global Insight economists as the most overvalued housing market in the nation, after prices surged 140% from 2001.Zorn, 70, thought he had made a “pretty good deal” in a market where investors lined up to buy properties. Then the market cratered. “We tried to sell it, and there was no activity,” he said. With prices having recovered most of the losses, he has put the property on the market for $280,000.In Charlotte, price gains have been led by in-town neighborhoods, which have seen “huge gains,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities who lives in the city. “Charlotte did not see home prices fall all that much during the recession, and the recovery here has been very strong.”Doherty moved in-town because she and her husband enjoyed amenities and events including nice restaurants and professional football and basketball. They also wanted to be closer to their grandchildren.The purchase has also helped fuel spending. After buying a “fixer-upper,” the couple poured more than $100,000 into construction, repairing termite damage and installing new air conditioning, electrical fixtures, roofing and siding. Next year, they plan to expand with a new master-suite bedroom and bath that could cost another $70,000.Rising values of neighboring homes make them confident they are making a worthwhile investment.“It was a little bit risky” to buy at the time, Doherty said. “The market has turned in our favor.”Related: Home Prices Accelerate To 5.2% Gain: Case-ShillerStartup Pursues Home-Equity Market From New AngleForeclosure Pipeline Is Down To A Trickle.

524,WFC,"Shares of Coca-Cola (KO), one of Warren Buffett's ""Big Four"" investments, touched an all-time high Tuesday as consumer stocks continued to show strength amid the recent market volatility.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has 400 million shares, or a 9.3% stake, in Coca-Cola. American Express (AXP), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are the rest of Berkshire's top four stock holdings.Coca-Cola shares closed down 0.1% at 45.24 on the stock market today after rising as high as 45.56 earlier. Its stock rose above a first-stage base with a 44.01 buy point on Feb. 22. It's risen about 11% from the low point of the base and was extended far above its 10-week and 200-day averages.Coca-Cola's earnings per share growth appears poised for a comeback. Growth over the last three quarters has improved from -14% to -8% and -6% last quarter. Wall Street consensus is for the company's EPS this quarter to be flat on a year-over-year basis; it's expected to then return to growth, posting a 3% increase next quarter.The company on Feb. 18 said that it was raising its quarterly divided to 35 cents a share from 33 cents, prompting RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi to say in a report that Coke is about to kick off a long-term bull run that could last three to eight years.Coke joins other consumer stocks, such as McDonald's (MCD), Home Depot (HD), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and and Ross Stores (ROST), which are all trading in record high territory.McDonald's rose to a new high close at 124.61 on Feb. 1. On Tuesday, it rose 0.4% to at 123.43.Home Depot hit a fresh high at 134.74 on Nov. 27 before consolidating. It gained 0.7% Tuesday. Meanwhile, HD Supply (HDS), a home and building supplies distributor, gapped up as much as 6% after it reported better than expected earnings Tuesday and issued bullish guidance. Shares jumped 4.8% Tuesday.Domino's Pizza shot up 13% on Feb. 25 to 132.90 after reporting a 27% surge in quarterly EPS. Domino's dipped 1.1% Tuesday.
"
525,WFC,"Automakers reported another strong month of U.S. sales on Tuesday, but concerns are growing that the industry's reliance on subprime credit and longer loan maturities make demand unsustainable.Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reported better-than-expected February U.S. sales, led by higher-priced, gas-guzzling SUVs and pickups. General Motors (GM) reported a surprise decline vs. a year earlier as it slashed sales to rental car agencies to boost profitability.But with sales plateauing at high levels, automakers will be tempted to dip even further into the credit pool.About 11.5% of new-car buyers had credit scores below 600 (defined as ""subprime"" and ""deep subprime"") in Q3 2015, the highest figure for Q3 since 2007, according to Experian data. They also accounted for 32.2% of used car sales in Q3, up from a year earlier but below levels during the recession and the early recovery years. Experian will release Q4 data on Thursday.And as they've become a bigger piece of auto financing, a growing portion of these subprime loans are in trouble.Delinquencies on subprime auto loans packaged into bonds rose to 4.7%, their highest level in six years, according to Wells Fargo. The default rate, up 12.3% in January's from December's 11.3%, also is at its highest rate since 2010, though still below recession levels.Despite the upswing in delinquencies, subprime loans expand sales and profits. General Motors' GM Financial's Q4 net income more than doubled to $131 million, as total assets rose 38% to $65.9 billion. Ford and Fiat Chrysler also have captive finance arms.Subprime auto loans aren't as dangerous as subprime home loans. It's a much smaller pool of loans, and it's much easier for lenders to repossess a car than foreclose on someone's house. But when the next recession hits, automakers will suffer financing losses and slash new subprime loans, exacerbating sales losses.Some analysts are more worried about when the next time will be that consumers buy cars. The average age of cars and trucks has been touted as a reason why new car sales had to boom. Now, longer-lasting cars, along with long-term loans, are giving reason to be concerned.The average maturity of new car loans at finance companies has climbed more than six months from 59.46 in March 2009 to 65.51 in September 2015, according to St. Louis Federal Reserve data. Nearly 30% of new vehicle loans are for terms of 73 to 84 months, according Melinda Zabritski, senior director of automotive credit at Experian.Average new-car financing has risen to about $27,700, up about $3,000 from mid-2011. Car buyers have spread out higher prices over time to lower monthly payments.The fast pace of auto sales during the last two years has done much to alleviate the pent-up demand but is now contributing to fears of weak sales growth in the near future, wrote John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities, in a Feb. 5 research note.Car and truck owners often would trade in cars after a few years. Now, longer loans may spur drivers to push back new buys for longer, thus reducing future sales.""If you push the buy cycle out, you’re going to have fewer sales,"" said Steven Szakaly, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association.Longer loans have left the auto industry addicted to 0% financing. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter-point in December, and policymakers appear to be in no hurry to hike further in the near term. But over time, rates will likely rise, and that could have a huge impact.A 100-basis-point increase in loan rates would cut auto production by 12% and sales by 3.5%, a recent New York Fed report concluded.Ford late last year quickly scrapped a ""Friends and Family"" promotion, despite incentives of up to $10,000 on some models, because it lacked 0% loans.If automakers choose to keep 0% loans even as the Fed raises rates, that will eat into credit arms' profits.

526,WFC,"If there is a rule that managers of huge mutual funds can't outperform the stock market, Will Danoff is an exception. He's proved that size hasn't robbed him of the flexibility needed to build positions in stocks before they make their big moves up.The $102 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) stood as the fifth largest U.S. stock mutual fund tracked by Morningstar Inc. as of Jan. 31. And its performance ranked in the top 1% of its large-cap growth peers over the 15 years through Feb. 29.Its 12.65% average annual return since Will Danoff took the helm on Sept. 17, 1990, ranked in the top 5% of its direct rivals. In that time span, those competitors averaged an 8.42% annual gain. The S&P 500 racked up a 9.64% average annual return.Contrafund is also the largest among the 370 Fidelity funds that Morningstar follows.The fund garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Contrafund fell 1.18% last month, a little worse than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund’s 0.15% decline.Danoff also runs or co-runs three additional portfolios, with $30.5 billion in assets.Danoff, 55 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: If you don't mind me saying so, Will, you sound like you have a cold. How are you doing?Danoff: No, I don't have a cold. It's just been a long earnings season. It's like this every quarter.IBD: Does your fund's large size make it harder to do any of the things you want to?Danoff: Yeah, Paul, managing a $100 billion-plus fund is harder than managing a smaller fund.I can't move as quickly as smaller funds, so one has to play to (one’s) strengths. The strength of having about $110 billion is that I really have to think about the three-to-five-year opportunity in stocks I own. So I want stocks that are what I call best-of-breed.They're well-positioned in their industry, doing something special, have strong brands (and) excellent management teams and excellent business models.Over the years, I've found that companies that generate a lot of free cash flow have more options when in an uncertain environment. And when management owns a chunk of stock and thinks like owners, they tend to do the right thing at the right time in the cycle.Every industry is cyclical, so you really have to try to identify smart management teams that are experienced and passionate about their industry.And over time, that's one of the huge lessons I've learned. Being big, I have to think long-term. I do have to think about whether I trust the management team, whether I fully appreciate all of the risks in a particular stock in a particular industry. So being thoughtful before jumping in has reduced my turnover over time. And I think it's increased the quality of the companies I own.IBD: How do some of your holdings fit this overall thesis?Danoff: If I look at my top 10, you see Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), Wells Fargo (WFC), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX), Nike (NKE). These are well-run companies that are relatively easy to understand the value proposition of, the kinds of companies that consumers rate very highly in terms of value derived.If you ask your kids, ""Do you like Google?"" I think they would say, ""Yes,"" and they would use it all the time and derive a lot of value from Google.Nike: the same sort of thing. Thirteen-year-old boys love it whether that's (based on their) perception or reality (about whether they should). And as an investor, you layer on that this is a good business.Facebook: the core app and the core Instagram app are the two most popular apps on smartphones in terms of what people actually do on smartphones. And as more eyeballs spend more time on Facebook and Instagram, Facebook should be able to monetize those eyeballs.And Starbucks: they're so far ahead of other restaurants and cafes in developing mobile order and pay and pickup. They doing well overseas, especially in Asia. And they're improving their food and improving their average paycheck. And they bought Teavana. The development of that is a built-in option. I like optionality.As we've talked about in the past, Paul, when your customers are deriving a lot of value, most likely the customer in the U.S. is going to be similar to the customer in Europe and Asia. Google is excluded from China, but we've talked about Nike. That 13-year-old boy in China is probably just like the 13-year-old in the U.S. and Europe. They want to wear the same sneaker that LeBron James or Roger Federer is wearing.That model enables Nike to sell (products) at a healthy margin. That's good for shareholders of Nike.The world has become competitive. The world has opened. But if you have products that people want, you will have a bigger market.Technology has proliferated and made companies more efficient. Nike can sell over the world, but now it has only one computer system to worry about. They don't need to replicate a big infrastructure all over the world. That's made corporate America and big corporations worldwide more profitable than in the past.Top-line opportunities are much greater. And the expenses associated with attacking that opportunity grow less than revenues do. So that's a very good thing.IBD: So size helps you more than hurts you?Danoff: Size allows me to work with a world-class research team. Fidelity has an army of smart, motivated analysts all over the world who are looking around for best-of-breed companies, companies that are gaining market share, companies that are doing something different.I also have access to very smart (non-Fidelity) people on Wall Street, analysts who help us with their ideas.And I have access to companies' management teams. They know that we are or could be their largest shareholder. So (they talk with us, and) we can dig a little deeper than the typical company. We can see someone other than the CFO and CEO. What I've found over time is that a deep management team that is aligned with the same strategy and the same incentives makes a very powerful organization.IBD: You don't mind being forced to focus more on bigger companies?Danoff: The issue becomes that if three investors visit a company and (one investor) is managing $1 billion and the second is managing $5 billion, I can't make that company a large position in my fund instantly. I must slowly build that position.Bigger positions in my fund are about $5 billion. But you can't just call your broker and say, ""I want $5 billion of Nike or Starbucks."" It takes time to build a position to that size. So this is a poker game, Paul. And in poker, you're not sure when you're first dealt your cards whether you've got a winning hand. If you have two aces and another player and I are showing a two or a three, you might bet a little more than if the hand were different.But if you get a third ace, you might bet more. That's worked well for me.IBD: How hard is it to go through a down market like the one we've had since late 2015?Danoff: One advantage of being a big fund is that I see a shareholder probably every day. If I'm having a bad week like (some recent ones), some shareholder says, ""Hey, I've been in the fund 20 years. Thank you."" And I realize he's right. The point isn't whether you win every second or every day. You've got to win over time instead.That means avoiding big mistakes. That means trying to capitalize when you have a lot of conviction in particular stocks.Right now, whatever's out of favor -- oil -- I can continue to talk to our oil analyst and say, ""Let's talk to someone smart who's been around a long time, talk to a survivor, and see what they say. Let's talk with an executive who has made you money over time. Hopefully, they will help you understand what's happening right now and how to play this situation.""If you're managing just $1 billion, you don't have that breadth of (access). The more companies that you talk to, the better that you do.IBD: Are you buying bargains amid the pullback?Danoff: What am I doing as the market pulls back? I've been talking to a lot of companies. (Danoff began to look at his calendar and recite the industries whose executives he has recently spoken with.) Biotech, gold, retailers, media, autos, refining, defense, restaurants, more media, paper, steel, housing related, media again, tech, autos, pharma, semiconductors. That's this week.I've probably talked with seven, eight, nine -- 35 companies this week. It's been busy because a lot of companies are reporting earnings. But that's what you've got to do.What I've done over time is concentrate on earnings-per-share growth. Every industry is cyclical. You've got to find companies that are going to grow over time, names that you want to buy on a market pullback like we've seen.IBD: So you're bargain hunting?Danoff: Yeah, that's what's happened. I'm trying to upgrade the quality of my portfolio in this downturn. That's worked for me. Other people have different strategies. But when the whole market sells off 10% or 15%, I'm looking to buy the very best companies that have pulled back with the market.IBD: What's the hardest part of your job when overall economic growth slows a lot?Danoff: We've seen a slowdown in earnings forecasts. That's what the market is struggling with. But hopefully good stock pickers like my colleagues at Fidelity will be able to find companies that, despite the sluggish economic environment, are going to grow.When perceived growth slows, with an expensive stock you get the double whammy of earnings growth slowing and the P-E (ratio) declining. That's what you want to avoid. So we're trying to be certain of our earnings growth projections on individual companies. It's not easy.IBD: Jason Weiner (manager of $1.2 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) and its advisor-sold clone $2.6 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund (EPGAX)) once told me you were one of his mentors. Who has been your mentor?Danoff: Joel Tillinghast (manager of three funds, including $38 billion Low-Priced Stock (FLPSX)) and I started when Peter Lynch (current Fidelity vice chairman, who managed now-$14 billion Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) from May 1977 to May 1990), Bruce Johnstone (former manager of three funds) and George Vanderheiden (former manager of five funds) were the leading fund managers.Peter is an exceptional human being. He's a really hard worker, smart, a great individual. He's a walking encyclopedia of corporate knowledge and business history.I made some rookie mistakes. Because he was so experienced, he let it roll.I was a retail analyst. I would walk into some manager's office and say, ""Let me tell you about this great stock story."" But if the manager was focused on something else, he (would not be interested). But Peter would say, ""That sounds interesting. Let's call them."" Or ""Let me know the next time you're calling them so I can hear it. Can I come with you for a visit?""Peter was all about when in doubt, call the company. Find out the facts. When you have facts, you can make better decisions.IBD: Do you still talk with him?Danoff: Oh, yes. Peter comes around. He's a great sounding board. I'd say probably twice a year, Joel and I and probably a few others reach out to him and say, ""Let's have lunch.""His message is still the same: Stay on the offensive. When you find a good idea, that gives you perspective on something else you own.That's where Peter is outstanding. He says, ""Keep flexible. Keep looking forward. Call companies.""He has a tremendous ability to keep looking in areas where I might have had limited interest. Peter is great at keeping an open mind, staying on the offensive. George was like this as well.

527,WFC,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) continued to build its stock portfolio last year while shedding bond holdings.On Saturday, Berkshire released its list of stock holdings, along with full-year 2015 and fourth-quarter financial results.Buffett's top 15 stock holdings include what he calls the company's ""Big Four"" investments: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire purchased additional shares of IBM during the year, boosting its total ownership to 81.03 million shares, or an 8.4% ownership stake at the end of the year vs. 7.8% at the end of 2014. Wells Fargo grew to 500 million shares, or a 9.8% stake, up from 9.4%.At Coke and American Express, share buybacks raised Berkshire's percentage ownership. Its 400 million shares of Coke are a 9.3% stake, up from 9.2%. And it owns 151.6 million shares of American Express, or 15.6%, up from 14.8%.Buffett said a major Berkshire equity position that's not on the list of 15 is Bank of America (BAC).""We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end, these shares were worth $11.8 billion,"" he said, adding that it's likely Berkshire will buy them just before the options expire.Buffett added: ""It is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth-largest equity investment.""Berkshire's class B shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, and they are up nearly 10% from a Feb. 3 intraday low. Although its position improved, its stock still traded below both its 50-day and 200-day averages.American Express rose 0.4%, Coke ended flat, IBM fell 0.8%, but Wells Fargo slid 2.4%.Among other Berkshire top stock holdings, it has 46.6 million shares of IBD Leaderboard stock AT&T (T) (0.8% ownership), 24.7 million shares of credit rating and research agency Moody's (MCO) (12.6%), 18.5 million shares of dialysis services company DaVita Healthcare Partners (DVA) (8.8%), and 22.16 million shares of heavy equipment maker Deere (DE) (7%).Berkshire has also been buying big blocks of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) since last summer, fueling speculation that it may be Buffett's next acquisition target. As of Dec. 31, Berkshire owned 55.38 million shares or 10.5% of the company, and its stake has since risen to around 15%. Phillips was up 1.5% at 80.27 Monday.Meanwhile, for a sixth year in a row, Buffett reduced his bond holdings amid continued low yields. Berkshire owned about $25 billion in aggregate, on an amortized cost basis as of Dec. 31, down from nearly $35 billion at the end of 2009, Bloomberg said. Buffett said bonds are such a poor investment tool that they ""should come with a warning label.""At the end of 2015, his biggest bond holdings were in foreign bonds, followed by corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
"
528,WFC,"T-10 hrs days until the official start of earnings season and T-5 days until Uncle Sam comes knocking on your door asking for money…..all while the big banks are working extra hard to hold prices nearer the recent highs as the tax deadline approaches….Stocks ended lower last week with the S&P and Dow finishing in positive territory for the day but about 1% lower for the week….energy tried to make a comeback while financials and tech came under continued pressure. In initial trading – stocks gapped UP on the open – continuing to reflect the inverse relationship between the weaker dollar and oil – you see - as the dollar weakens, oil, other commodities and stocks tend to strengthen – but the strength in stocks was short lived as sellers took advantage of the move ahead of the weekend and buyers grew weary.There was plenty of conflicting data to deal with during the week - First we had a bevy of Fed Presidents giving their views on the state of affairs – as they try to show that they are in control of both monetary policy and the dollar – Does the word 'conflicting' mean anything to anyone? (Yellen - FED Chair - says rates are not going anywhere while members of the Peanut Gallery suggest that rates are going up at the end of the month) So once again the conflicting speeches did nothing but cause confusion and frustration among investors as the reality of exhausted monetary policy initiatives begins to bubble to the surface.And speaking of an 'exhausted monetary policy' – Did you hear all of the chatter around how the Yen continues to advance in the face of NEGATIVE interest rates? Yes – ma'am – the BoJ (Bank of Japan) last month introduced negative rates - as another source of stimulus - to try and force the Yen to weaken – thereby helping their export economy – but in a perverse twist of fate – the Yen has only strengthened vs. the dollar which is sending PM Shinzo Abe, Finance Minister Taro Aso and BoJ Governor Hauhiko Kuroda into a rage….And not to be outdone - negative interest rates imposed by the ECB (European Central Bank) two months ago are also NOT accomplishing the stated goals as the Euro continues to strengthen as well – sending Uncle Mario (Draghi) and other members of the ECB closer to the edge.But this leaves us to ask – are the strength in these currencies due to the recent FED inaction over the future of US interest rates or due to healthier Asian and European economies? The smart money is betting the former....(Remember: The expectation of a rate rise in March caused the dollar to rally vs. these currencies - from early Feb thru Mid March....but then - a NO action move by the fed, coupled with a clear concern over the state of the global economy caused the dollar to weaken sending these other reserve currencies higher and this is causing angst and panic among the paparazzi).Next up – we got a range of macroeconomic data points – all showing continued weakness in the economy which did nothing to help investor psyche – add in the chatter from some of the Fed representatives who discount the data and tell us that we are all wrong and that the economy is firing on all 12 cylinders and you have a perfect recipe for paralysis…..How's that working for you?And this week – there is plenty of global macro data points to digest. Retail sales from the US, China and Brazil. PPI's from the US, UK, Japan and China. CPI's from the US, UK, Euro zone, China. Industrial Production numbers from the US, Euro zone, China, Japan. Capacity Utilization and Empire Manufacturing from the US. We will also here from the BoE and the PBoC on additional monetary policy initiatives.Next up - Earnings! and while they tell us that we are NOT in another recession - there is no argument that US Corporate earnings are......As we know - this qtr is set to be the WORST season in 6 yrs.....with earnings projected to FALL by 9% - but with all of the most recent downgrades to earnings - the joke begins again.....You see - In the end – analysts cut the estimates to the bone, lowering the bar and making it almost impossible for companies NOT to beat the expectations and then the street gets to celebrate and the conversation turns to how the season 'wasn't so bad'…… (Psychology 101)Tonight after the bell - we get Alcoa (AA) - no longer considered the bell weather that it was when it was a member of the DOW - but their results will set the tone for some of the large multi-nationals.....The real kicker is going to be the major banks - think JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) which begin their confessional period on Wednesday...…..so watch for much more stock specific activity in the days ahead as the reports hit the tape. In the next couple f weeks - we will get the regional banks, energy and oil companies, retailers, drugs, healthcare, home builders, industrials/conglomerates and technology. What will the multinationals say about the state of affairs in their respective industries and the impact of monetary policy on their businesses – (Think dollar) vs. what will US businesses say about the condition of the US economy and the health of the US consumer?Remember – earnings are now history – they are what they are – what investors and the mkts want to see are the seeds of real top line revenue growth and projections for a more vibrant, robust future vs. continued talk of layoffs and cost cutting to support the bottom line…A quick glance back at mkt action over the past half dozen years and beyond reveals a seasonal weakness right after the 15th….and I would not expect this year to be any different at all…..I mean – What has changed in 8 yrs? Nothing really –Oh yes….the Obama administration will tell us how the economy has created some 14 mil new jobs and that the unemployment rate is below 5% and wages have stabilized and the consumer has never been stronger – and to that I say BS! Because if that were really true then FED policy would be different……rates would have normalized long ago, GDP would not be the pathetic sub 2% that it is, inflation would be greater than the 2% target and we would be seeing strong upward pressure on wages as companies compete for employees – and that is NOT happening at all. In fact – wages continue to weaken because of the massive supply of underemployed and unemployed Americans, older workers are getting thrown out in favor of younger less experienced workers (think expensive senior level people), other jobs continue to get shifted overseas where the minimum wage is maybe $3.50 an hr…Take the banking and credit card industry as an example – every time you call the 800 number – you get someone in a third world country that wants you SS number, your physical address, your IP address and your DOB... and then we wonder how we get our identities stolen?Overnight – Asian mkts were mixed. Japan (-0.5%) continues to be assaulted by a rising Yen sending exporters deeper into negative territory. BoJ Governor Kuroda is keeping a close eye on how a rising Yen is creating instability in the Nikkei and is prepared to act if need be. He will be in NY on Thursday - so expect to hear more from him then. In China (+1.4%) – The gov't released their March inflation data – CPI rose by 2.3% y/y – in line with forecasts while the monthly read fell by 0.4% m/m. The PPI fell by 4.3% y/y marking the 49th consecutive month of lower readings and this news only suggests that we can expect more monetary easing.
"
529,WFC,"The World Bank also warned of slowing economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific Rim due to a weaker China.....(more of the same....but it is a reason for some of today's Asian weakness) .European mkts are all in positive territory now that oil reversed its course lower in early trading. The Euro is trading flat vs. the dollar and the expectation of additional monetary stimulus continues to support those mkts. so the focus for them is also the coming earnings season. FTSE +0.01%, CAC 40 + 0.59%, DAX + 1.19%, EUROSTOXX + 1%, SPAIN +1.42% and ITALY +1.74%US futures are higher by 9 pts this morning - in a continued game of 'cat and mouse' ....suggesting that the S&P will try to test the most recent highs of 2075 before the onslaught of earnings begins. Remember - the underlying tech tone of the mkts is suspect at best......Companies that are in buyback mode are effectively out of the mkt for now - so let's see how investors really feel about the quality of earnings and the quality of the global macro data. I continue to believe that we will remain in the 2040/2070 range until we get bank earnings beginning on Wednesday.....And then the real test begins.Take Good Care

531,WFC,"Home-equity loan delinquencies fell below their 15-year average in Q4, dropping 0.23 percentage point to 2.68% of all accounts, the American Bankers Association said, coming just before JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks kick off Q1 earnings season.Meanwhile, property improvement loan delinquencies rose 0.05 point to 0.92% of all accounts.""It’s been a long, rocky road, but home equity delinquencies have finally worked their way back to historical norms,"" said James Chessen, ABA’s chief economist, in a statement.The strong increase in home prices over the last three years has boosted equity, helping to keep loans current more of a priority for homeowners.""With rising home equity and shrinking delinquencies becoming the status quo, banks are more willing to extend new home equity loans and lines to qualified borrowers,"" Chessen said.The composite ratio held steady at 1.41% in Q4. The ratio tracks eight closed-end loan installment categories. Among those categories is personal loan delinquencies, which fell to 1.44% from 1.52%.Also, bank card delinquencies slipped slightly to 2.52%.The delinquency numbers come just before big banks' Q1 earnings season kick off. JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, reports first-quarter earnings on April 13. Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on April 14 and Citigroup (C) reports the following day.

532,WFC,"Talk about a BIG NOTHING DONE! Stocks did NOTHING yesterday.....finishing with a mix of boring results...there was NO follow thru at all after the spike on Wednesday! This left me thinking why? Reminds me of that incomparable 1975 hit - Hold Back the Night - Who remembers it? (The Trammps)""Hold back the night, turn on the lights - Don't want to dream about you - Dream about you, baby. When you left you took the sun right out of my sky - oh yes you did. Wondered why you went away, never told me why.......""Where did you go? How could you bring me to the edge, make me taste the sweetness............ of this long awaited 'break out' ...... and then just leave me? I mean - the rally on Wednesday came out of left field - its strength surprising so many..... piercing thru resistance like a hot knife thru butta - creating all kinds of new excitement - leaving so many to think -
"
533,WFC,"OK - here we go...............and then - nothing! What's up with that? (Reminds me of being a teenager.....oh the memories!)The mkt chopped all day on either side of the unchanged line - suggesting that no one was in control - resulting in what is known as a 'spinning top candlestick pattern' - most often seen at the beginning of a trend reversal......A spinning top pattern is defined as a type of candlestick formation (technical analysis) - it is mkt action that suggests exhaustion - where neither side is in control....now in this case - since the mkt spiked higher and has been attempting to move higher - a spinning candlestick would suggest that the bulls are tired and do not have the fire power right now to push up and thru....if on the other hand this pattern happened after an explosive move lower then it would signal that the bears have been exhausted - leaving the door open for the bulls to attack. So are we on the edge of a 'trend reversal'?The flat and choppy trading yesterday came as traders took a breather... Earnings were terrible (again) yesterday.....but we knew that yet support continues to be there despite the disappointing results.....Bank of America reported 1Q profit fell 13%, hurt by a big drop in trading revenue and the continued drag of low interest rates. Revenue fell to $19.51 billion falling short of the adjusted $20.3 billion expected by analysts.Wells Fargo told us that income from all three businesses declined, with its largest business - community banking - reporting a 7% fall in the first quarter and what makes this dangerous is that they have $17.8 billion in oil and gas loans of which 93% of those loans are junk-rated companies.(Lets remind ourselves what JUNK means.....old or discarded articles that are considered useless or of LITTLE VALUE - but in the investment world - that is not so true.....these JUNK companies in fact MAY have value to investors that know how to pick them off - as they take advantage of the financial misfortune that is so prevalent in today's economy - so good for the value investor as he/she buys them those loans for pennies on the dollar - but bad for the banks who have to sell them for pennies on the dollar).Weak oil prices started the ball rolling.....companies came under pressure unable to pay back the debts (loans) and then these debts go into default causing the banks to take a hit to earnings and reserves.....(which is what we are seeing...)
"
534,WFC,"So - another down turn in oil prices - IF it comes - really makes the banks vulnerable. In fact, energy defaults among American energy related junk bonds topped $14 billion in April.....Yes - billion with a 'B'. and we are only two weeks into the month....Never mind that WFC is among the five big banks failed by U.S. regulators on Wednesday because they would be forced to rely on taxpayer money in a bankruptcy as they are considered a “to big to fail” bank. (No one at all is suggesting that WFC is on the verge of bankruptcy - but after the GFC of 2007-2016 - we do need to discuss it!)And - BlackRock Inc., (the world’s largest money manager) , said 1Q profit fell 20% as the global stock-market slump earlier in the year hurt revenues and forced the firm to CUT jobs. So here is that pattern that we discussed yesterday......It seems like everything measure of health is falling..... HELLO??? Anyone in DC paying attention at all?Now overnight - the long awaited Chinese GDP hit the tape.....and as expected they reported a 6.7% rate of growth - NO SURPRISE at all......analysts quickly hit the news wires suggesting that the Chinese economy is stabilizing - but they are not out of the woods just yet.... Jing Ulrich - MD and Vice Chairwoman at JPM in that regions had this to say:""You're seeing the economy recovering from eh lows that we saw in December and January of last year...that shows that the gov't measures are beginning to have an effect...""And to that investors said 'Whatever...."" and mkt action was muted.....this report did not cause a stir at all.... Look at the beginning of the year China was in turmoil and world markets were collapsing..all because of the 'China Syndrome' as investors worried about Chinese GDP and how a bad number would trigger even more panic......but alas - that did not happen at all....China reported a GDP at 6.9% in January and indicated that yes the economy was slowing but there was no reason for global investors to panic....The news outlets on the other hand made it out to be the end of the world...saying that it was the “weakest annual pace of growth in a quarter century.” !A qtr of a century.....that means 25 yrs ago - so what was the rate 25 yrs ago.....it WAS 3.9% but at the time - the size of their economy was $390 bil.....and today its growing at 6.7% but it’s now a $10.8 trillion economy – or 30 times bigger... ...so listen...the US economy was $390 bil in 1953 and it took almost 50 yrs for us to become a $10 tril economy.......that is double the time it has taken the Chinese.....so what am I missing? And for the past 15 yrs we have grown at about 2% /yr.....so if China keeps growing at 6.7% or so - they are gonna run us over in a matter of years......so someone better wake up......Now this morning...US futures are wobbling again...currently down 3 pts in pre-mkt trading.....as we await reports from Citibank and Charlie Schwab.....

535,WFC,"Financial stock ETFs jabbed higher Tuesday as the big money-center banks gear for earnings kickoff this week.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, reports Wednesday. A slew of peers follow: Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Thursday, Citigroup (C) on Friday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, next week.Some market analysts caution that a tough first quarter is likely to weigh on their reports. They point out that the Federal Reserve's wariness on raising interest rates, coupled with global growth concerns, continue to weigh on the financial sector.Energy loans are particularly in focus as banks report, following JP Morgan's recent decision to raise energy-loan loss reserves.Despite oil's rebound from 2016 lows, cash-flow woes persist for many shale companies that bet big when crude was trading at $100 a barrel.Not all analysts share the concerns about the banking sector's health. Some say that U.S. bank stocks are the healthiest they have been in decades.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gained 1.3% on the stock market today. XLF invests in banks, insurance companies, capital markets companies, diversified financial companies, consumer banks, mortgage finance, REITs and real estate management companies.Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) reversed from a 1.5% loss intraday to a 1.1% gain at the close. XLFS invests in the same S&P 500 financial companies as XLF, but shuts out the REITs and real estate management companies.XLF and XLFS are down 5% and 8%, respectively, this year -- putting them at the bottom of the heap of 11 Select SPDR ETFs tracking S&P 500 sectors.One market technician says the chart picture for banks remains poor.""Banks remain troubled and should be avoided based on our work,"" said Ari Wald, executive director and senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. ""We see it as concerning that the KBW Bank index is showing signs of turning lower below its multiyear breakdown point.""Wald said the trend should be considered bearish while the index is below this important resistance. In addition, he noted that while (bank stock prices) have bounced from the February low, the industry’s relative strength has continued to trend lower -- a sign that banks continue to underperform.SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) offers targeted exposure to the banking industry.According to Wald, banks tend to perform well when interest rates rise, and vice versa, making it hard to recommend them in the current economic scenario.""We expect long-dated interest rates to remain anchored by global growth concerns,"" he said. ""Specifically, it’s difficult to make the case for U.S. rates to move significantly higher due to their relatively wide spread vs. ultralow interest rates in Germany and Japan.""As such, he recommended reducing positions in financial ETFs following the sector's bounce from its February low. At the industry level, he suggested buying the property and casualty insurance industry on weakness and selling life insurance on strength.Major stock indexes reversed sharply higher Tuesday as oil prices rose.West Texas Intermediate oil surged 4%, settling at $42.17 a barrel, its highest level in 2016.

551,WFC,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has become much more diversified and thus ""much less reliant"" on Warren Buffett's stock-market clairvoyance, evolving into a company positioned to outperform the S&P 500 amid economic uncertainty, UBS said Monday in initiating coverage of the investment firm.""We believe that the current uncertain economic and market environment plays into the hands of BRK, with its structural advantages of permanent capital, strong cash generation and industry-leading portfolio of businesses,"" UBS analyst Brian Meredith wrote in the initiation note, which gave Berkshire's A shares (BRKA) a buy rating and a 244,500 price target.""This enables BRK to make acquisitions and/or invest in its operating units despite challenging environments, positioning it to grow earnings and book value faster than the S&P 500,"" Meredith wrote.Berkshire over the years has become more of a diversified conglomerate and less of an insurance and investment firm, UBS said, helping cushion the company against difficulties in the insurance business and minimizing risk associated with Buffett's eventual departure from the company.""While Buffett's superior capital allocation skills and market 'clout' would be missed, as long as the culture does not change, we would expect the company to continue to outperform,"" Meredith said, adding that the market hasn't priced in a significant premium for him as CEO amid the shift to a diversified conglomerate.Berkshire Hathaway’s entry into insurance began with the 1967 purchase of National Indemnity. But over the years, it has diversified through acquisitions, growing into four main areas of operation that oversee such companies as Geico, Duracell and various energy, manufacturing and railroad companies.That diversification has cushioned the company against difficulties in the insurance business and would likely help minimize risk associated with Buffett’s departure from the company, UBS said.Berkshire's A shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today. The more widely traded B shares also rose 0.8% Monday and have climbed nearly 14% since a Jan. 25 low.UBS' coverage comes as Buffett's stake in Wells Fargo (WFC) nears 10%, an amount that would necessitate a review from the Federal Reserve intended to protect against undue investor influence, Bloomberg reported.Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway has also been amassing a large stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX), possibly foreshadowing a huge acquisition.Wells Fargo dipped 0.4% Monday, while Phillips 66 lost 0.65%. Among Berkshire's other top holdings, Coca-Cola (KO) added 0.5%, while American Express (AXP) eased 0.3%.
"
552,WFC,"At some prominent financial advisory firms, nearly 20% of the advisors have some misconduct in their past. That fact is among the findings in a study of 1.2 million U.S. advisor disclosure statements by researchers from the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Overall, “roughly 7% of advisors have misconduct records,” says the study, “The Market for Financial Adviser Misconduct,” published at the online Social Science Research Network. The study uses information from BrokerCheck, a database of advisors and firms from the federal Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).The most common forms of misconduct are unsuitable investments (committed by 21.29% of those who misbehave); misrepresentation or misleading reports, often dealing with account activity (17.7%); and unauthorized activity (15.1%).Some firms tend to avoid misconduct. At Morgan Stanley (MS), only one in every 126 advisors, or 0.79%, has misconduct on his or her record. Other clean firms include Goldman Sachs (GS) (0.88%) and BNP Paribas Securities (1.17%).Other companies are not quite so strict. Nearly one-fifth (19.6%) of the advisors at Oppenheimer & Co. have one or more incidents of misconduct in their past. Other companies with a high proportion of rule breakers include First Allied Securities (17.7%) and Wells Fargo (WFC) Advisors Financial Network (15.3%).Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network should not be confused with other Wells Fargo organizations; Wells Fargo Securities, for instance, has a low misconduct rate of 1.7%. And Oppenheimer & Co. is not the same organization as Oppenheimer Asset Management, Oppenheimer Capital and similarly named groups.Financial firms are often vigilant in punishing advisors. “Half of financial advisors lose their job after misconduct,” the report on advisors says. “Following misconduct, advisors face longer unemployment spells and move to less reputable firms, with a 10% reduction in compensation.”

553,WFC,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

554,WFC,"Warren Buffett said Saturday that the net worth of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) rose $15.4 billion in 2015, boosting the per-share book value of both its Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%.Buffett was upbeat in his annual letter to shareholders, saying it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America for 240 years, and ""now is no time to start.""""America's golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs,"" Buffett said in the letter.In the 31-page missive, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in Q4, crushing consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.75.For the full year, earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion. Total revenue for the year rose 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014.Berkshire owns Geico Insurance, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, and as of January, Precision Castparts. Berkshire also holds significant holdings in companies such as Kraft Heinz (KHC), IBM (IBM) and  Wells Fargo (WFC).It should be no surprise that the company's Railroads, Utilities and Energy business fared the worst amid declining rail shipments and plunging gas prices.  Still, revenue for that business was down just 1.7% in Q4 at $40.004 billion. Earnings fell 2.9% to $1.507 billion.Total revenue for the company's flagship insurance businesses continued to show big gains, rising 10.9% in the quarter to $162.89 billion. But earnings fell to $4.9 billion in 2015 vs. $5.2 billion in 2014.  Earnings for the underwriting business soared 60% to $306 million, while earnings for the Insurance-investment income unit were up 17.4% at $1.033 billion.Earnings for other businesses and miscellaneous items climbed 36.3% to $1.827 billion.Buffett commented on the $37.2 billion purchase in January of aerospace components maker Precision Castparts, which he described as a newcomer to the ""Powerhouse Six"" businesses in the company's Railroads/Utility/Energy group. ""PCC fits perfectly into the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earnings power.""He also commented on a proxy proposal regarding climate change that's on the agenda for the company's annual meeting, which is slated to be streamed live for the first time ever on the morning of April 30. Buffett said concerns about how climate change might affect the company's insurance payouts are unwarranted because Berkshire's insurance policies are typically repriced every year, factoring in increased risk such as climate change.Commenting on stock investments, Buffett said the company increased its interest in each of its top four holdings last year: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM and Wells Fargo.  Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo shares were essentially flat in 2015, while IBM and American Express were big losers.Berkshire most recently has been buying big blocks of oil refiner Philips 66 (PSX) and as of Dec. 31 owned 55.38 million shares, giving it a 10.5% stake in the company, which has continued rising this year.Buffett also noted that in 2015 Berkshire invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment, 86% of it deployed in the U.S.Berkshire Hathaway shares declined for most of 2015 and into early 2016, and hasn't been above its 200-day line since a brief spell last July. But the stock is up 7% from an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and closed at 131.92 in Friday trading on the stock market today, down 0.3% for the day.
"
555,WFC,"A provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that takes effect in December forces banks to keep a stake in the commercial-property loans they package into securities and sell off to investors. The rule is intended to deter the type of risky lending that helped fuel the last decade’s boom and bust. Under the current business model, banks are encouraged to issue as many loans as they think they can securitize and sell, with underwriting standards sometimes falling by the wayside, said Lea Overby, a debt analyst at Nomura Holdings.“Originators know their product better than anyone, and they are less likely to underwrite really bad stuff if they have to hold it,” Overby said in an interview.The biggest players in the $550 billion market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Deutsche Bank (DB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), are juggling multiple scenarios as they prepare for the new rule, according to bankers with knowledge of the deliberations. Banks may be required to hold as much as $50 million in capital for a $1 billion deal, a tough prospect to stomach with banks under pressure to keep their balance sheets in check. The rule also creates an opportunity for investors to team up with banks on the debt.Turmoil in global markets is exacerbating the uncertainty surrounding how lenders will adjust to the new regulations. The CMBS market is already on shaky ground as the rout in oil prices, slowing growth in China and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s course on interest rates spook investors in stocks and bonds around the world.The extra yield buyers demand to own commercial-mortgage bonds relative to benchmark interest rates has surged to the highest since 2011, meaning investors view the securities as increasingly risky, according to Morgan Stanley (MS). Since January, the spread between the benchmark and CMBS rated BBB-minus, the lowest investment-grade ranking, has jumped 240 basis points, or 2.4 percentage points, the bank’s data show. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Richard Hill cut their 2016 CMBS sales forecast to $70 billion from $100 billion as lenders pull back.Dealers are struggling to sell CMBS deals that have been in the pipeline for months, according to Leo Huang, who oversees commercial real estate debt at Ellington Management Group.“Money is being lost in amounts that haven’t been seen in years,” Huang said. “This should remind people there is substantial risk in this business.”The new requirement, dubbed risk retention, applies to all types of securitization, the process by which debt is pooled together and sliced into bonds of varying risk and reward. Such offerings backed by home loans were ground zero for the financial crisis.The changes are creating an opportunity for real estate investors. Industry lobbyists won a concession from lawmakers to create an exemption for the CMBS market, allowing a third party to take on the risk on behalf of lenders as long as they agree not to sell their investment for at least five years. Banks will be held legally accountable if the firm they sell to violates the rules.The CMBS market has a built-in cohort, called B-piece buyers, that buys the riskiest portions, absorbing losses first in exchange for a hefty yield. Firms including Ellington, DoubleLine Capital and KKR & Co. (KKR) have entered the space in recent years, which was dominated by a handful of specialists prior to the financial crisis. Several B-piece buyers are seeking to raise funds to step in for the banks, though it may be difficult to find investors willing to lock up their cash for five years or more, said Warren Friend, an executive managing director at Situs, a commercial real estate consulting firm.Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan are among lenders weighing the costs of tying up their own capital versus the economics of compensating B-piece buyers for buying and holding large chunks of new deals, according to bankers at the firms who asked not to be identified because talks aren’t public. Banks with larger balance sheets are more likely to take on the risk themselves, they said.Representatives for Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan declined to comment on regulatory issues.One option is for B-piece buyers to buy loans from the banks -- as opposed to just buying a slice -- with the banks selling securitized debt to investors on behalf of the B-piece buyers, said Huang of Ellington, the hedge fund firm founded by Michael Vranos. The bank’s role in the deal would be more of an agent, as opposed to taking on principal risk, Huang said.“Our vision is for banks to do what they do well: using the relationships they have to originate loans and distribute bonds through their sales and trading desks,” Huang said.Some lenders probably will get pushed out of the business by escalating costs, said Overby of Nomura Holdings. Recent volatility has already claimed at least one of the smaller firms. Redwood Trust (RWT) , a Mill Valley, Calif.-based real estate finance company, said this month that it’s exiting the business of making loans for CMBS deals, citing the challenging market and escalating risks. About 25 employees will be cut, the company said.Other lenders are likely to become pickier about the commercial-property loans they issue as the end of the year approaches, said Friend of Situs. That may make it harder for property owners to refinance just as a wave of loans made during the market’s 2007 peak starts to come due, and some borrowers will have to swallow higher costs passed along by lenders, said Friend, who spent more than 14 years as a managing director in the CMBS groups at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank.“Rates will have to go up,” he said, “and the amount of equity they will have to put in the deal will increase.”Related:U.S. Property Companies See Israel As A Promised Land Of InvestorsMortgage Bankers Would Swap More Risk For Lower Fees

556,WFC,"Wall Street banks have declared war on Silicon Valley mobile payments platforms, arming to do battle in the peer-to-peer mobile payments business.As the likes of Square (SQ), Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) have charged into the uncharted waters of peer-to-peer payments, Wall Street banks have spent five years stitching together an alliance among JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) and others, according to a press release from Early Warning.Early Warning is a real-time payments and authentication firm that will manage clearXchange, a technology that lets bank customers make quick -- near-instant -- transactions. It now generally takes one to three days to transfer money between banks. Banks had been slow to innovate after the financial crisis, but now ""what we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview with Reuters.The banks are starting to use clearXchange to allow customers to transfer money almost instantly to friends and family. Peer-to-peer payments have been popular among millennials for splitting dinner bills, cab fare and paying rent.Achieving a critical mass fast is important for the banks using clearXchange. The so-called network effects -- the value unlocked from having a large customer base -- were critical to PayPal's early success in online payments, for example.PayPal was early to the peer-to-peer market and snapped up the popular Venmo app as a part of its $800 million Braintree acquisition in 2013. Braintree had acquired Venmo in 2012. Last year, Venmo moved $7.5 billion between people, and in January alone it handled $1 billion, PayPal told Reuters.As of Wednesday, only customers at U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America will be able to send money via mobile devices with the clearXchange platform. JPMorgan and Capital One Financial (COF) told Reuters they plan to plug in to the platform ""later this year.""Citigroup (C) is among banks that have not joined the alliance, Reuters said.PayPal stock was up a fraction, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Shares are just below an early entry at 38.62. A conventional buy point lies at 42.65.Square stock was down a fraction Wednesday afternoon, as the company was set to report its Q4 earnings after the close. Investors are likely going to focus on Square Capital, the company's financial services arm, as an area of growth.Square's peer-to-peer payments app Square Cash recently added a feature that let customers store money in it, much like a PayPal account already does.Facebook built its peer-to-peer payments play within its Messenger app, and it did so in-house. The company has said Messenger has more than 800 million customers. Facebook stock was up 1% Wednesday afternoon, near 107.

557,WFC,"So the mkt does the dance (again).....we woke up yesterday with a renewed disaster story in oil - the commodity came under immediate pressure and by the opening bell - it was trading 4.% lower, which then caused all of the algo's to hit the sell button on stocks...and why again? Why is it that stocks are so connected to oil? Why are stocks trading in lockstep with oil?How about - the talking heads have married to the two - thereby forcing the movement on a daily basis...the thinking goes like this: If oil is weak then that MUST mean that the global economy is weak. Period - The end. Let's not even discuss the absurdity of this argument at all.....this is NOT a lack of demand issue, it is all about a huge over SUPPLY issue - and this issue is not going away anytime soon - the Saudi's have made that quite clear.The lunacy could not have been more obvious yesterday.....you see - we woke up to a buildup in crude oil supplies and the negative banking story about how JP Morgan (JPM) and others are building up reserves to cushion the blow of failing oil and gas companies and what is expected to be the next disaster for the global economy. Add in the not so vague commentary by the Saudi oil minister that they are prepared to slaughter the competition and you have every reason to think - 'Hey - this could get a bit ugly....' (never mind that none of this is new news - but that's another story).The mkt opens lower and then proceeds to trade even lower from there....by 10:30 am - the DOW was down 266 pts or 1.6%, the S&P down 30 pts or 1.5%, the Nasdaq lost 77 pts or 1.74%.....and then we got 'The News' that ignited the fire....sending oil and stocks higher.....The US Dept of Energy reported that the gasoline inventory drawdown from last week as 2.236 million barrels vs. the expected drawdown of 1.033 million barrels....so essentially we used double the amount of gasoline in one week vs. what the brain trust predicted...and this one piece of data, this one piece of fairly 'irrelevant' data (in the big scheme of things) sent the algos into a buying frenzy....Why? Because the geeks who program the computers can only think A or B. If A then do X, If B - then do Y.. in this case A & B are:IF: drawdown is bigger than expected - then initiate BUY ordersIF: drawdown is less than expected - then initiate SELL ordersSo - folks - this one data point - which on the face of it appears 'bullish' - bigger drawdown means that we are using more gas - which then means that businesses must be doing more business and consumer must be spending more money, and construction companies must be building more houses and car companies will surely be selling more cars and the summer driving season most assuredly will be full of families packing up their cars with bikes and surfboards and luggage racks and once again driving to the oceans and lakes around he country to celebrate a strengthening economy.... which then means that hotels and motels will raise prices to take advantage of this surge and KMart, Target (TGT) & Nordstrom (JWN) must be gearing up to sell more bathing suits and summer outfits and restaurants will have to remodel to handle the onslaught of Americans going out to eat.....(See how I did that...I connected all those dots with one weekly gasoline report)REALLY? We get all that out of one weekly gasoline inventory report? I mean what happened to oversupply in crude inventories that is about to bankrupt the country? It's almost comical, isn't it?Bottom line is that crude oil prices once again survived the $30 support level and now faces another test. That test is a challenge of the 50dma which is at $34.44.....A failure for oil to pierce this resistance level will ensure that oil and stocks will hit another road block. An advance up and thru the 50 dma will ignite another rally in stocks - taking us up and thru the 50 dma at 1946 on the S&P - which will then cause sellers to back off as the bulls will push the mkt back to 2000 - in what I still think is a 'counter cyclical rally inside of a bearish longer term trend - due to all of the uncertainty around the FED policy decision.Any more suggestions of multiple rate hikes will kill any move higher....one single hike will be hard enough for the mkt to swallow while other central banks move to negative rates. Multiple hikes in the face of weakening European and Asian mkts will cause investors to punish stocks in order to re-price them.And this morning we get these headlines:""Pressure on ECB Mounts as Euro-Area Inflation Revised Lower""""The Big NEW Threat to Oil Prices: A GLUT of Gasoline - Several refineries in the Midwest have opted to reduce activity for economic reasons..."" We are swimming in crude and refined gasoline products - which should only further undermine prices.....""Banks Brace for Potential Energy Losses - Drop in oil prices is hitting lenders' energy loans; latest figures are a grudging admission of the truth..."" - this is more of the Jamie Dimon story...but this time the featured bank is Wells Fargo (WFC)....and they released this statement:""If oil prices remain low for a prolonged period of time, there could be addition performance deterioration in our oil and gas portfolio resulting in higher criticized assets, nonperforming loans, allowance levels and ultimately credit losses...""Translation of that very sophisticated statement: ""We are .....(insert word that begins with ?).And so - what do the smart logic algo's think about that? Do they even have the definition of that word programmed into their memory banks? I mean that word has so many meanings.....based on how it is used, so..... I'm just sayin....
"
558,WFC,"Now this morning we are seeing European mkts in rally mode......after we saw that strong demand for gasoline yesterday....Reuters puts it this way:""Markets have taken comfort from the fact that US crude oil futures held steady in early trading on Thursday as strong demand for gasoline was offset by a new record in crude stockpiles...""How crazy is that? European investors are jumping in on stocks because Americans used more gas than expected. You can't make this up...who would really believe it? Never mind that Eurozone inflation was just revised lower - which only forces Uncle Mario's to consider MORE stimulus.....FTSE + 2.38%, CAC 40 + 2.41%, DAX + 1.47%, EUROSTOXX +2%, SPAIN +2.7% and ITALY +2.7%.US futures are now up 4 pts - teasing 1934.....resistance (1946) is now only 12 pts away....This will be the third time that we challenge it....(we challenged it on the 22nd and the 23rd) ...I would not be surprised to see us pierce it today.....It just feels like it wants to.....(it's a gut thing, nothing more).Today we will hear from Dennis Lockhart (Atlanta FED) at 8:15 am and San Francisco's John Williams at noon.Take Good Care

560,WFC,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

561,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Santander (SAN) are all returning more capital to shareholders ahead of the next round of stress tests that could determine if more generous capital plans on the way.Bank of America will repurchase $800 million of its common stock, coming in addition to the $4 billion in buybacks the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender authorized a year earlier.The Federal Reserve didn't object to BofA's proposed repurchases, the bank said Friday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“The move today is some additional confidence that the buybacks are going to continue,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA.Bank of America shares closed up 2.9% on the stock market today.The news came one day after JPMorgan said it could boost its share buyback program by $1.9 billion through June after getting the OK from the Fed. Capital One Financial (COF) likewise added an authorization for $300 million in additional buybacks last month.The buybacks come as the annual stress tests for banks approach. Banks must submit their capital plans and stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5. The Fed will announce the stress test results before June 30.With the Federal Reserve stress tests coming, up the fact big banks are feeling confident enough to buy back their own stock is a good sign. The Fed’s decision not to object to BofA and JPMorgan’s buybacks also should be viewed positively, Mayo added.“This is certainly a step in the right direction,” he said. “The Fed is not a rubber stamp.”Mayo added, “This is the first time in 20 years that we’ve recommended all four of the biggest banks.”Meanwhile, Santander said it plans to boost its dividend 5% this year after having slashed it by more than 60% last year.Big banks' stocks reacted positively as part of the upsurge for shares in early trading, as the S&P 500 turned positive for the year after January and February's horrible slump.JPMorgan rose 2.9%, Citigroup (C) added 1.6% and Wells Fargo (WFC) also rose 1.6%. Capital One shares rose 1.5%, while Santander edged up 0.4%.

Meanwhile, Baker Hughes and Halliburton (HAL) keep hitting roadblocks from European and U.S. antitrust regulators in getting their merger approved.Schlumberger shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes lost 1.8%, and Halliburton dipped 0.4%.UBS started Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares with a buy rating and a $244,500 price target. Shares rose 0.8%. Meanwhile, the more widely traded B class shares of Berkshire (BRKB) have risen nearly 14% since a Jan. 25 low and also rose 0.8% Monday.Dollar General's (DG) price target was raised to 110 from 90 by Stifel. Last week, Dollar General announced plans to expand its test of its smaller-format stores this year. Shares rallied 2.5%.Finish Line (FINL) was upgraded to buy by Monness Crespi Hardt and BB&T Capital. On Thursday, Finish Line reported strong Q4 results, but guided fiscal 2017 low.

563,WFC,"The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, but policymakers may signal fresh monetary action in the next few months, perhaps in June.The Fed will issue its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET, along with new economic forecasts. Fed Chairwoman will hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m.The central bank raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December. But financial market turmoil, perhaps partially fueled by that December move, along with weaker economic data spurred policymakers to hold off on further tightening at its Jan. 26-27 meeting, noting in the post-meeting statement that they were ""closely monitoring global economic and financial developments.""But global stock markets and oil prices have steadied, while U.S. economic data generally have been more favorable, though retail sales data Tuesday were weak.Investors will be looking for signs that the central bank is leaning toward hikes once again, in either the policy statement, Fed forecasts or Yellen's presser. The Fed may indicate that it's no longer forecasting four tightening moves this year, though market forecasts have consistently been less aggressive -- and more accurate -- than the Fed itself.The European Central Bank last week pushed its key rate further into negative territory and expanded its asset buying program. Such action could boost global growth. Also, the euro unexpectedly rallied on the ECB's action, which should make U.S. exports more competitive, at the margin. (A similar pattern happened earlier this year, when the yen rallied on the Bank of Japan's decision to push its own rate into negative territory.Higher rates could help ease pressure on net interest margins for Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others. Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo shares have all risen slightly above their 50-day moving averages in recent sessions.

564,WFC,"When Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) discusses fourth quarter earnings on Saturday, the company's recent major investments will likely be high on the agenda.A company spokesperson said the company will discuss Q4 results when it releases its annual report that day.Buffett has been loading up on shares of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX). As of mid-February, Berkshire owned about 14% of that company's equity. The sometimes nearly daily purchases of millions of shares of Phillips 66 has fueled speculation that he might acquire the company outright, which would be one of Berkshire's largest ever purchases.Phillips 66's market value of roughly $42.16 billion would likely push the price above the $37.2 billion Berkshire paid in January for forged components and aerospace castings maker Precision Castparts.Buffett continues to like top U.S. home mortgage lender Wells Fargo (WFC) too, and last quarter bought another 9 million shares, according to the company's end of quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wells Fargo on Wednesday set aside $1.2 billion for energy-related loan losses.Analyst consensus is for Berkshire to report an 8.7% increase in Q4 earnings per share to $1.75. Anything above that could spur a stock rise after the company just met estimates the prior quarter and missed the quarter before that.Berkshire avoided a Standard & Poor's rating downgrade last week, when S&P left its ""AA"" credit rating for the Warren Buffett-led company alone, saying its diversification and ""modest"" financial risks indicated that a downgrade wasn't necessary despite red flags.S&P put Berkshire on review last August, citing the company's huge cash outlay for the Precision Castparts deal. But S&P in its latest report cited Berkshire's ""consistently strong"" profitability and liquidity, in addition to its cash flow from subsidiaries.Berkshire ""B"" type shares took a hit during the recent market correction, amid concerns about its cash outlays. But it's rebounded about 6% from a Jan. 15 low of 124.12 to close up 0.3% in Wednesday stock market trading to close at 131.03.Phillips 66 rose 0.5% to 79.09 and Wells Fargo slid 1% to 47.61.

565,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) on Wednesdsay set aside $1.2 billion in reserves for oil and gas loans gone bad, becoming the second big bank in two days to make such an announcement.Energy-related loans comprise 2% of Wells Fargo's overall loan portfolio, but make up about 10% of its total loan loss reserves, the San Francisco-based bank announced in a regulatory filing. If oil prices remain low for an extended period of time, there could be additional deterioration in its energy portfolio, resulting in nonperforming loans and credit losses, Wells Fargo warned.The filing came one day after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) boosted its energy-related loan loss reserves by 60% to $1.3 billion. JPMorgan  also warned of a ""very tough"" Q1 for investment banking.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley (MS) late Tuesday disclosed that it has $15.9 billion in energy-related loans, with only 60% investment grade.Wells Fargo shares fell 1% to 47.61 on the stock market today after sinking to 46.56 intraday. JPMorgan stock rose 2 cents to 56.14 tumbling 4.2% on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley was flat after losing 3.2% Tuesday.Many regional banks such as Comerica (CMA) are believed to be much-more heavily exposed to energy sector woes. Comerica stock fell 0.2% Wednesday after tumbling 4.5% Tuesday.The crumbling energy sector has adversely impacted banks, hurt by loans to energy companies that have gone bad as oversupply and soft demand have gutted prices by more than 70% since June 2014.Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley said it doesn't expect oil to hit $70 per barrel until 2018. On Wednesday, U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $32.15 a barrel on Wednesday after falling more than 4% intraday.Image provided by Shutterstock.

567,WFC,"HSBC (HSBC) swung to a $1.3 billion net loss in Q4 from a year-ago profit of $511 million, as it faces slower economic growth in Asia and a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into its Asian hiring practices.Before taxes, HSBC reported a net loss of $858 million during the fourth quarter. The bank's net profit for 2015 fell 1.2% to $13.5 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets fell 8.5% to $2.4 trillion.It boosted its Q4 dividend to 20 cents a share and its full-year dividend to 50 cents a share. Both dividends were raised a penny.HSBC shares were down 1.8% on the stock market today, and have tumbled 20% so far this year, pushing them to their lowest level since the Great Recession. HSBC currently has and IBD Composite Rating of 31 out of 99, meaning it is being outperformed by 69% of other companies.The performance of Europe's largest bank was ""broadly satisfactory,"" said Chairman Douglas Flint, in a statement. But Flint noted that last year was marked by ""seismic shifts in global economic conditions, most notably the continuation of a sharp decline in commodity and oil prices, in part attributable to growing concerns over China’s slowing economic growth.""HSBC has axed jobs and trimmed operations as it pivots to the Asia-Pacific region and is selling off businesses in Brazil. The bank recently announced it is keeping its headquarters in London instead of moving it to Hong Kong, where it has maintained a big presence since its founding in the then-British colony 150 years ago. HSBC has been based in the United Kingdom since 1993.The bank also disclosed it is the subject of an SEC investigation into its employment practices of people connected to government officials in Asia-Pacific nations. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) already is facing a similar federal probe.HSBC also reported setbacks in its efforts to comply with a five-year deferred prosecution agreement reached in 2012 over charges that it ignored possible money laundering by drug traffickers. If HSBC doesn't fully comply with the agreement, it could face criminal prosecution and lose its U.S. banking license.Most bank stocks performed well Monday as markets turned upward. JPMorgan rose 1.3%, Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 2.3%, Bank of America (BAC) rose 3.4% and Citigroup (C) climbed 1.4%.European banks' U.S. shares performed well too. Barclays (BCS) rose 1%, while Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) climbed 2.9% and 4.15%, respectively.Overall, 2016 has been a poor year for bank stocks, as global growth worries and the decision of some central banks to go further into negative rates has hurt them.

568,WFC,"Financing for cars and trucks is setting records, and big banks such as Bank of America (BAC) want in on the action, even as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and others blow the warning whistle.The average amount financed for a new car or truck in the fourth quarter rose 4.1% year over year to a record $29,551, Experian Automotive said. The average monthly payment rose 2.3% to $493, also a record, even as loan terms get longer.Average loan terms for new and used cars held firm in Q4, at an elevated 67 months and 63 months, respectively. Longer-term loans (with terms of 73-84 months) for new vehicles reached 29%, while longer-term loans for used vehicles climbed to 16.4%.New-car loans for subprime lenders rose to 10.7% in Q4 compared to 10.1% a year earlier, while new-car loans for deep subprime lenders rose to 0.78% in Q4 from 0.68% in the year-earlier period. For used car loans, the number of subprime and deep subprime lenders fell year over year in the fourth quarter, down 0.54 point for the former, and down 0.19 point for the latter.Other data show that subprime defaults and delinquency rates are the highest in several years.Nearly 86% of all new vehicles and 55% of all used vehicles sold during Q4 were financed.Boosted by cheap fuel, easy credit and increased financing, U.S. auto sales climbed to their best February performance in 15 years, with Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) each reporting double-digit gains, as did Nissan (NSANY) and Honda (HMC). General Motors (GM) reported a 1.5% sales decline last month as it cut lower-margin shipments to rental fleets.But there are concerns that the auto industry's growth, based on subprime and longer loans, is not sustainable, pushing out the buying cycle.Still, Bank of America is making a big move into auto loans, an area where Wells Fargo (WFC) has been a strong performer in recent years.But there are concerns that there are problems in the auto lending market. Banks categorized $1.1 billion worth of auto loans as uncollectible in Q4, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., up 15% from Q4 2014 and a 39% increase since Q4 2011.In January, Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase, called the auto lending market ""stretched.""

The company routinely generates single-digit sales gains and low-double-digit earnings growth, aided by share buybacks.Following the Fed’s rate hike last year and forecasts for fatter industry tech budgets, more of the same could be in store despite worries over a downturn and consolidation, the company and analysts say. That's due primarily to a steady income base.“When you have 85% of revenue recurring, it gives them a very good visibility into their numbers,” helping enable more accurate guidance and minimizing surprises when earnings season rolls around, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Alexander Veytsman told Investor's Business Daily.“They do increase pricing, but given the longevity of those contracts and given the fact that these clients have been with them for a number of years, I would say they’re growing it slowly and steadily,” Veytsman said.The nature of the company’s contracts with clients helps Fiserv maintain its firm footing. Many deals are longer-term and retention is high, Morningstar notes in its research on the company. In addition, it’s costly and potentially hugely disruptive for financial companies to switch from one core-processing service to another, helping Fiserv keep customers in the fold.And even amid Wall Street’s hand-wringing over a possible recession, Chief Executive Jeffery Yabuki told IBD that he sees the trends in tech spending among Fiserv’s own clients continuing.""Most of our revenue is based on non-discretionary, mission-critical technologies under longer term contracts and is not subject to dramatic fluctuation,” he said via email. “We are seeing stable and growing demand for newer technologies that enhance experiences in the increasingly digital world.”Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv serves 13,000 banks, credit unions, retailers and other clients around the world. If you’ve withdrawn money from an automated teller or transferred a balance from one account to another, there’s a good chance it went smoothly in part because of Fiserv.Created in 1984 through a merger, Fiserv handles everything from transaction processing to data analysis to person-to-person payment systems. With this year’s technology spending seen growing 4%-5% among banks and credit-union customers -- Fiserv’s bread and butter -- the company is set to follow, Argus Research says.“We believe that Fiserv remains well positioned to benefit from technology infrastructure spending among its primary customers (banks and credit unions), many of whom are working to improve processing efficiency for online bill payment and debit card transactions,” Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said in a research note last month.“This should help revenue to keep rising at a modest mid-single-digit pace,” Biggar said, adding that Argus sees 5.5% in sales growth this year.Shares are up 25% over the past 12 months. The company has a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, boosted most recently by its strong fourth-quarter results that were marked by better-than-expected operating margins.The company also has tried to stay relevant through acquisitions. In 2011, Fiserv snapped up mobile banking company M-Com and digital payments outfit CashEdge, which gave it Popmoney, a bank-based person-to-person payments system for participating institutions that has helped drive sales growth. The company in 2013 announced that it acquired Open Solutions, giving it real-time account-processing technology.“You don’t need a new product every day,” Biggar said, “but you need something fairly significant every 2-3 years that would have its own sort of life cycle.”Last month, Fiserv said the United Nations Federal Credit Union for U.N. employees, among the largest in the U.S. by assets, will begin using Fiserv’s core account-processing technology. Analysts say the Federal Reserve’s rate hike in December could help strengthen banks’ finances, potentially freeing up cash for their technology budgets.“We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend, as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape,” CEO Yabuki said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last month.Some concern persists that Fiserv could make less money if consolidation continues within the banking industry, either due to tightening regulations or an event like the 2008 financial crisis. Mergers and acquisitions could reduce client count and give those bigger, combined companies more muscle in negotiating cheaper contract prices with companies like Fiserv.However, the reduction in clients hasn't materialized, Veytsman said, and the prospect of more banks bringing tech operations in-house seems unlikely. Fiserv counts Wells Fargo (WFC) among its big clients, potentially signaling a stronger shift to outsourcing among larger banks.Monness Crespi's Veytsman said consolidation could actually accelerate the trend of tech outsourcing.“When they consolidate they also look to see what’s happening with the bottom line and what they’re doing around the costs,” he said. “And if someone was not considering using Fiserv as a client, maybe together, they will.”Yabuki sees consolidation continuing, but stressed that the number of accounts and transactions has kept rising for the company.Foreign exchange amid a stronger dollar could also hurt the company, although its international exposure is limited, Veytsman said. Jack Henry & Associates and FIS are among the company’s primary competitors. Concern also lingers about Fiserv’s debt, although Yabuki cites the company’s $1-billion-plus free cash flow last year.Still, both Biggar and Veytsman say the company’s acquisitions have been relatively focused and restrained.And one might be forgiven for wondering whether a person-to-person service like Popmoney can compete with PayPal’s (PYPL) Venmo, or payment-tech offerings from Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and, potentially, Apple (AAPL).However, Yabuki said P2P was in the early innings. And Veytsman said Popmoney is intended more as a side dish in its offerings to midcap banks than a main course.""It’s very hard to challenge PayPal,” he said.

570,WFC,"The head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve on Tuesday urged lawmakers to go beyond Dodd-Frank's regulations and consider breaking up large banks to end the ""too big to fail"" phenomenon.Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari urged lawmakers to break up large banks such  into smaller, less connected, less important entities. Kashkari also proposed turning big banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually cannot fail. He likewise proposed reducing systemic risks by taxing leverage throughout the financial system.""The economy is stronger now, and the time has come to move past parochial interests and solve this problem,"" Kashkari said. ""The risks of not doing so are just too great.""Last year, analysts at Goldman Sachs called for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), currently the nation's largest bank and the world's sixth-largest lender, to be broken up into smaller units to provide more shareholder value. Analysts at UBS also have called for London-based HSBC (HSBC), Europe's largest bank, to break itself up in order to better serve investors.Under Dodd-Frank and other national and global regulations since the financial crisis, the largest banks such as JPMorgan have to hold extra capital, reducing some of the incentive to be bigger.Kashkari is a former executive at Goldman Sachs (GS) and Pacific Investment Management Co. who worked at the Treasury Department during the financial crisis of 2008. He oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a $700 billion bank bailout initiative. In 2014, he was the Republican candidate for California governor, losing to the Democratic incumbent, Jerry Brown.Bank stocks rose Tuesday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase improved by 1.5% on the stock market today, while Wells Fargo (WFC) advanced 2%, Bank of America (BAC) added 2.5%, and Citigroup (C) was higher by 3.6%. Bank shares have had a terrible start to the year, with major lenders hitting 52-week lows amid global headwinds such as negative interest rates in much of the world. BofA is down 28% so far in 2016, while Citigroup shares have declined 24%.Kashkari expressed skepticism that the current regulatory scheme would be useful to regulators in the event of another crisis, which he added, ""we won't see ... coming.""Kashkari's comments Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. come amid increased rancor on the left from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate who has vowed to break up big banks within one year after taking office.But banks and other financial institutions have been slimming down in recent years, in part to avoid regulatory burdens, reduce expenses and cut headcount. General Electric (GE) has sold off much of its GE Capital unit, which in 2014 provided more than 40% of its profit. General Electric shares rose 2.1% Tuesday.MetLife (MET) says it will sell or spin off much of its U.S. life insurance unit to avoid higher capital charges assessed on entities declared to be ""systemically important financial institutions."" MetLife stock climbed 1.6%.

573,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has added $500 million to its loan loss reserves for the first quarter, an increase of more than 60%, to guard against continuing losses in the energy sector.The New York-based lender's move brings its total energy-related loan loss reserves to $1.3 billion. It reported more than $800 million in energy loan loss reserves at the end of last year. At JPMorgan's investor day, the bank said if crude oil falls to $25 per barrel and stays there for 18 months, it could add an additional $1.5 billion to its reserve balance.Meanwhile, JPMorgan investment bank chief Daniel Pinto sees a ""very tough quarter"" so far, predicting investment bank fees will fall 25% vs. a year earlier. M&A activity is holding up, but debt and equity capital markets are struggling.JPMorgan shares fell 4.2% to 56.12 on the stock market today.Investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) said late Tuesday in an SEC filing that it has $15.9 billion in energy-related loans, saying 60% are investment grade. That implies that 40% are junk-rated. Morgan Stanley shares were little changed late Tuesday after closing down 3.4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) is the largest pure-play U.S. investment bank. Goldman shares fell 2.6%.Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are among the big U.S. banks bracing for more energy loan losses. Wells Fargo stock lost 2.2%, Citigroup 3.3% and Bank of America 3%.A slew of oil and natural gas companies have come under pressure as energy prices have plunged.Banks themselves are being hurt by low interest rates (which limit their ability to make profits off loans), regulatory pressures, global economic weakness and a battered energy sector.

574,WFC,"Financial ETF investors are an irked lot. They piled into this asset class in late 2015, hoping for a turbo-charged ride on the coattails of Fed rate hikes. Instead, they've been stuck in the slow lane.Even much-maligned energy stocks have fared far better.The financial rout is cause for concern. The sector accounts for 16% of the S&P 500 index, second only to technology. It underpins business growth, so its troubles tend to trickle down the economy.""My biggest worry would be related to oil-related loans,"" says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research.Big banks and regional banks lent aggressively at the height of the fracking boom. They dished out loans to oil and gas companies, as well to the hotels, homebuilders and related industries that sprang up to service them, from Alaska to North Dakota to Virginia.Now oil's fallen far, far more than anyone expected. And businesses tied to energy are a bagful of hurt.The issue isn't just that banks are going to make losses on those loans, Mishra said. It's that they haven't been entirely upfront about their vulnerability to the oil patch.One of the nation's largest banks recently gave a revised figure for its energy exposure that far exceeded its previous one, according to Mishra. It had previously left out approved lines of credit from its calculations.""We don't have clear visibility on how much those losses are going to be,"" she added. ""We need to know more about their exposure to the oil industry, directly as well as indirectly.""The flagship Financial Select Sector SDPR (XLF) has given up 12% year to date. Its new sibling Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) is down 14%. They're at the bottom of the heap of 11 peers tracking S&P 500 sectors.By comparison, SDPR S&P 500 (SPY), tracking the broad stock market, is down 5% so far in 2016.XLF sliced below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages Dec. 30 and has made two feeble attempts at a rally after hitting fresh 52-week lows this year. It's trading at roughly half its pre-financial crisis high of 38.15.Year to date, it's leaked $1.59 billion in investor outflow -- almost the entire amount it absorbed in Q4 last year.It's not just oil that's weighing on financial stocks. More than one or two rate hikes in 2016 seem a long shot as global growth falters. Higher interest rates boost banks' profit margins.In Europe and Japan, policymakers have toyed with zero and negative interest rates to stimulate growth. European banks face problems of their own making too. Deutsche Bank, mired in debt, saw its stock fall as much as 35% this year. Credit Suisse is caught in a money-laundering scandal.""For the first time since 2008, there is a little bit of angst about the financial health of banks,"" says Marc Pfeffer, a senior portfolio manager at CLS Investments. ""Domestic banks have been guilty by association.""He finds the financial sell-off a little overdone. The likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are ""well capitalized, totally fine,"" he says.Post-financial crisis, the financial services sector has been subject to tighter control. That's been a mixed bag for them. The bottom line for investors, however, is that many U.S. financial companies have the strongest balance sheets they have had in years.The risk-off tone to the market has unduly impacted banks, says Dave Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs.He believes investors extrapolating the worst-case scenario from the headlines may be missing out on opportunities.""Financials and energy are really trading in lock-step,"" Mazza said. ""That's made financials become further undervalued compared to the broader market.""Some pockets of financial services are faring better than others. Insurance is proving more resilient in a two-speed economy, where the services sector is holding up better than manufacturing. Capital markets have been harder hit. Their business is tied more to GDP growth and industrial strength.Pfeffer also likes the outlook for regional banks.One of the funds he manages has a big holding in XLF. He also has a smaller position in SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE).Domestic banks should benefit from a steepening yield curve in the second half of the year.""As the dust settles, I would look to increase exposure to financials,"" Pfeffer said. He is, however, braced for a bumpy ride.

575,WFC,"Standard & Poor's cut the ratings of four regional banks, including Comerica (CMA) and Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI), because of their exposure to the battered energy sector and low crude oil prices.Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR) and BOK Financial (BOKF) were the other two lenders whose ratings suffered a cut late Tuesday.""We are in the early innings of the downturn, in our view, and we expect loan losses to rise over the next two years, even if energy prices rebound modestly from current levels,"" S&P said in a statement.Comerica and BOK Financial Corp were lowered to BBB+ from A-, while Cullen/Frost Bankers was cut to A- from A. Texas Capital Bancshares was lowered to BB+ from BBB-.In addition, S&P revised its ratings outlook to negative for the four banks, suggesting another downgrade is possible in the future.Shares of Comerica closed down 1.2% Wednesday but climbed 4% after hours, Texas Capital fell 2%, Cullen/Frost rallied 0.3%, and BOK gained 0.8%.Last week, Fitch Ratings said most U.S. banks can weather the cheap oil storm for now, but it warned that a prolonged slump in crude oil prices could cause problems for lenders, particularly mid-sized banks with exposure to the energy market.Last month, Wells Fargo (WFC) raised provisions against bad assets by 70%, nearly half of it for loans in the oil and gas sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said its expenses related to credit losses rose 49% during the fourth quarter, mostly driven by bad energy loans.Citigroup (C) has set aside $250 million to cover energy portfolio losses, but it warned it would have to double the overall provisions if oil fell below $25 per barrel.Thanks to oversupply and weak global demand, oil prices have plunged more than 70% from their level in June 2014.
"
576,WFC,"Direct exposure to plummeting oil prices is modest for U.S. banks, according to a study by Fitch Ratings, but it could intensify going further.Most U.S. banks are in a good position to withstand volatile energy markets despite several of them, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), announcing energy-related loan provisioning in Q4, Fitch said.""Losses to date have been minimal,"" said Doriana Gamboa, senior director at Fitch, in a statement.But if oil prices remain low for longer than expected, lenders -- particularly midsized banks  with outsized exposure -- could have problems with additional provisioning. Fitch said that it expects oil prices to increase to $45 per barrel on average this year and $55 in 2017. Crude oil currently trades around $30 per barrel.""Larger U.S. banks should be able to weather loan provisions without rating pressures, but negative rating actions are possible for some midtier banks if oil prices remain depressed near or under the $30 per barrel range for an extended period,"" said Julie Solar, senior director at Fitch.Last month, Wells Fargo raised provisions against bad assets by 70%, nearly half of them for loans in the oil and gas sector. JPMorgan said that its expenses related to credit losses surged 49% in Q4, mostly driven by bad energy loans. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of some ""stress"" in energy loans as the bank reported its Q4 earnings last month.Citigroup (C) has set aside $250 million to cover energy portfolio losses but warned that it would have to double the overall provisions if oil were to fall to $25 per barrel for a sustained period. Comerica (CMA) increased its provisions for credit losses to $35 million in Q4, up 35% from the third quarter's total.JPMorgan Chase closed down 1.1%, Wells Fargo dipped 0.8%, Citigroup lost 2.3% and Comerica eased 1.1% in the stock market today.

that's a loaded question......and if you believe in the conspiracy theory - 'They' could be any one of the big investment banks that have put their walnuts and reputation on the line with calls of $25, $20 and even $10 a barrel oil in 2016.    Or 'they' can be anyone like — your next door neighbor, your brother or sister in law, it could be your dad or your son & daughter… 'They' cold be anyone who is a commodities trader, with access to sophisticated trading systems and algorithms….men/women who consistently test the bounds for weakness or strength.… (now ‘they’ also exist in other asset classes as well….stocks, derivatives, other commodities, sectors….anywhere where ‘they’ can cause trouble…).     ’Now conveniently — the EIA (Energy Information Administration) came out and CUT their global 2016 oil demand forecast to 95.19 million barrels/day  (down from 95.22 million in December’s outlook) while INCREASING their forecast for global production to 95.93 million barrels a day,  and this gave those clowns what they needed — an excuse to test the psychological $30/barrel number and this is when the mkt went from being up strongly to giving it all back - it immediately felt heavy, lethargic and the whisper was - ""Will they test it today?""……  Recall the thinking……. $30 was the last bastion of support - but this was not NEW news......….once it breaks $30 then ‘it’s over’…….it would plummet into the high $20’s on its way to $10 — taking stocks (around the world) with it!  And for some other reason - it seemed that yesterday predictions of doom and gloom for stocks permeated the airwaves....calls for 'Sell EVERYTHING' were all over the web......Predictions of down 25%, 30% and even 50% for stocks were flying around the globe via social media outlets that allow for instantaneous publication....  This only added to the negative mood.......And so what happened?  'They' went to work........and started to sell oil with abandon......the commodity  went from $30.60 to $30.03 rather quickly (unlike how it usually trades)  and then stopped — but only for a min — stock traders prepared for the sell algo’s to go into overdrive, while the buy algo’s retreated……then ‘they’ did it…….the commodities traders — pushed it…….and BANG — the quotron machines (now known as Bloomberg Terminals or Reuters terminals……) published the news……..”Oil had broken $30/barrel”  (GASP!)   The media was covering the story tick by tick as ‘they’ pushed it to $29.95……….it was like a funeral for the ‘Head of State’ with all the pomp and circumstance…..the somberness, the black limos, the open casket and the line of citizens waiting in the frigid winter air to say their good bye's —……or was it really a GOOD BUY?  (notice the play on words..)No folks — the world did not end…the mkt did not implode, the panic did not ensue……the algo’s got confused…..what should they do now?  No one panicked…..and then the BULLS took control and started to pick away…..the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all  rallied only to get hit again as the BEARS who were hiding in the trees pounced......the BULLS temporarily knocked off their feet managed to get up again and rally stocks into the closing bell…..ending the day nearer the highs…….and the mkt breathed………and day turned into night…..   Today - Wednesday January 13th - Overnight mkts around the world continue to advance -  Asian mkts mostly higher, Emerging mkts enjoying a bounce and this morning European mkts are all up broadly......and US futures are pointing higher again.....wanting to retest the 1950 level as the sun rises over the Atlantic and night turns into day...    The China and OIL story that has managed to wipe some $5 trillion off the face of the earth showing signs of calm......   Technically the mkts are in well oversold territory.....McClennan Oscillator suggest a deeply oversold mkt and when this happens - we can expect what is known as a 'counter cyclcal rally'  or  a 'Bear Mkt Rally' - a rally that runs counter to the longer term trend....  These rallies tend to be swift and sometimes violent  as shorts get squeezed causing them to throw in the towel and just cover rather than suffer the larger losses.....longer term bargain hunters also jump into the fray only adding to the demand.....so sellers disappear and buyers trip over each other to buy stocks......- but these usually end with badly........  We are now in the beginning of earnings season and the mood is mixed about what to expect... Tomorrow brings us JP Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) while the rest of the banks will follow in the days after....WSJ front page article about JPM yesterday....besides more layoffs - they continue to CUT COSTS to shore up their numbers.....and now are -re-considering their commitment to all of the Bloomberg Terminals that have.....these glorified data centers runs at a minimum of $24k/yr per user.....so do the math......(let's go easy...and just say they have10k terminals at the base rate of $24k/yr - that alone is $240,000,000.....but remember - JPM usually doesn't do the BASE rate......Bloomberg charges you for every bit of data so rates for terminals can be much higher..... and  Mikey (Bloomberg) makes no bones about it - laughing all the way to the bank).  So will earnings surprise us and be the catalyst to change the trend or will they disappoint and only add to the angst?   The bigger picture remains murky.....Eco data later on in the week may provide a bit of a distraction - but will do little to change the mindset..... US Futures are up 12 pts now suggesting another attempt at a sustained rally.......Are the bears laying in wait at 1950?  Will they pounce yet again drawing new blood from an already weakened bull?

The New York-based bank earned 39 cents a share once costs were included.

598,WFC,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw double-digit bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter, thanks to lower litigation expenses and a strong performance from its consumer bank division.The nation's largest bank earned $1.32 a share, up 10.9% from a year earlier and 7 cents ahead of estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Net income was $5.4 billion. Revenue rose 0.8% to $23.7 billion, topping views for $22.9 billion.Full-year earnings per share rose 13.4% to $6 a share. Full-year revenue declined 1.3% to $96.6 billion.JPMorgan is the first bank to report quarterly and full-year earnings after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point last month. Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) report Friday.JPMorgan's net interest margin, the difference between the interest it charges on loans vs. what it pays out to depositors, increased to 2.23% compared with 2.16% in the third quarter.The bank's shares rose 1.5% to 58.20 after sinking nearly 3% on Wednesday and 13% in 2016 to an 11-month closing low. Wells Fargo climbed 1.8% to 50.64, and Citigroup advanced less than 1% to 45.38.Energy 'Stress'In a prepared statement, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon saluted the bank's ""strong loan growth and credit quality"" but warned of ""some stress in energy.""Tumbling oil prices have been blamed in part for the year's awful start in the stock market, which hurt banks' trading revenue. Also, if the Fed doesn't raise interest rates as quickly as originally thought, that may hurt banks' profitability this year.The bank's provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, up 49%, reflecting an increase in reserves of $149 million, with $124 million in the oil and gas portfolio and $35 million in mining.The fact that its energy credit reserves are modest suggests that JPMorgan isn't hitting the panic button when it comes to commodities, said Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""The fact they're not building more reserves ... suggests they don't see the need to build more. The commentary on energy credit was pretty supportive.""As of Dec. 31, JPMorgan's total assets fell 9% to $2.4 trillion. Total loans grew 11% to $837.3 billion. Excluding credit card loans, consumer loans surged 17% to $344.8 billion. Wholesale loans rose 9% to $361 billion.

Lower debt underwriting fees were offset in part by higher advisory fees. Fixed-income trading revenue fell 3% to $2.6 billion due to reduced activity in commodities and credit markets.Rounding out the six largest U.S. banks, Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report earnings on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs (GS) reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs is mulling big cuts to its fixed-income staff, reports say.Bank of America rose 0.6% to 14.99.

"
619,WFC,"Exposure to energy in Wells Fargo (WFC) and an underwhelming global banking performance for Citigroup (C) factored in as they, along with U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Friday.
"
620,WFC,"Wells Fargo said it earned $1.03 a share for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier and beating by a penny the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.7% to $21.6 billion, missing estimates of $21.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $4.15 a share, up 1.2% from 2014's total and matched views. Full-year revenue rose 2% to $86.1 billion, missing views of $86.5 billion.
"
621,WFC,"As of Dec. 31, total assets rose 6% to $1.8 trillion compared with a year earlier. Total loans rose 6.3% to $916.6 billion. Total consumer loans grew 2.7% to $460 billion. Commercial loans grew 10% to $456.6 billion.
"
622,WFC,"Wells' net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn in loans vs. what they pay out to depositors, slipped to 2.92% from the third quarter's 2.96% and 3.04% a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's decision to boost interest rates by 0.25% last month — the first interest rate hike since 2006 — is seen as helping boost banks' profitability. But the brutal start to the year for stocks, weak global growth and underwhelming inflation numbers could mean that further hikes could be delayed.
"
623,WFC,"The sagging energy sector also weighed on Wells Fargo to some degree. The San Francisco-based bank reported $831 million in credit losses in the fourth quarter, up 18.2% from the quarter before, primarily due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses as well as seasonal increases in non-real estate consumer portfolios. Costs decreased 2% to $12.4 billion from $12.65 billion, reflecting savings on employee benefits and commissions.
"
624,WFC,"Shares tumbled 4.2% to 48.51 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo's IBD Composite Rating is 64 out of 99, meaning it is outperforming 64% of other publicly traded companies. It is trading well below its 50-day moving average, and that fell below its 200-day line back in September.
"
625,WFC,"Meanwhile, Citigroup reported quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share, also beating views by a penny. The New York-based bank earned 6 cents a share in the year-ago quarter because of legal expenses. Revenue rose 4% to $18.6 billion, beating estimates of $17.9 billion. Full-year EPS was $5.35 a share, missing views by 9 cents, but during the year the bank earned $17.2 billion, its biggest profit in nearly a decade. For all of 2014, Citigroup earned $2.20 a share. Full-year revenue fell 1.5% to $76.1 billion, but beat estimates of $75.6 billion.
"
626,WFC,"Allowance for loan losses was $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter, or 2.1% of total loans. A year earlier, that total was $16 billion, or $2.5% of total loans. Citi set aside $250 million to cover losses to its energy portfolio.
"
627,WFC,"Operating expenses fell 23% to $11.1 billion, driven by lower legal costs. Loans fell 4% to $618 billion while deposits rose 1% to $908 billion. Net interest margins slipped to 2.92% compared with 2.94% in the third quarter.
"
628,WFC,"Profit at Citi Holdings, Citigroup's ""bad bank"" that has housed the company's sour assets since the 2008-09 financial crisis, soared to $704 million from $87 million a year earlier, thanks in part to the sale of OneMain Financial Group, Citi's subprime lending unit. Net income at Citi's global banking unit fell 20% to $1.3 billion and income from its institutional clients group dropped 18% to $1.4 billion.
"
629,WFC,"Citi has sought to become leaner and meaner since the financial crisis. It has sold off a number of its overseas assets in order to slim down. Total assets as of Dec. 31 were $1.7 trillion, putting it behind Wells Fargo in that department.
"
630,WFC,"Citi's shares sank 6.5% to 42.43, well below its 50-day line, which fell below its 200-day moving average in October. Its IBD Composite Rating is 48.
"
631,WFC,"Elsewhere, U.S. Bancorp earned 80 cents a share for the quarter, up 1.3% and beating views by a penny. Revenue fell 0.2% to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $5.1 billion. Full-year EPS was $3.16, up 2.6% from the previous year, matching views. Full-year revenue rose 2.5% to $20.1 billion, missing views of $20.2 billion.
"
632,WFC,"The Minneapolis-based bank earned $294 million in fees from credit and debit cards, up 8.1% and helping to offset declines in mortgage banking and investment product revenue.
"
633,WFC,"Net interest margin rose to 3.06% compared with the third quarter's 3.04%, but fell from Q4 2014's 3.14%. Average total loans grew 4.2% from a year earlier to $256.7 billion while total deposits grew 6.9% to $294.5 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets were $421.9 billion, up 4.8%.

"
637,WFC,"The Pittsburgh-based bank's net interest margin was 2.7%, down from 2.89% a year earlier, but an improvement over the third quarter's 2.67%.

"
641,WFC,"Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.Exposure to energy in Wells Fargo (WFC) and an underwhelming global banking performance for Citigroup (C) factored in as they, along with U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Friday.Wells Fargo said it earned $1.03 a share for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier and beating by a penny the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.7% to $21.6 billion, missing estimates of $21.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $4.15 a share, up 1.2% from 2014's total and matched views. Full-year revenue rose 2% to $86.1 billion, missing views of $86.5 billion.As of Dec. 31, total assets rose 6% to $1.8 trillion compared with a year earlier. Total loans rose 6.3% to $916.6 billion. Total consumer loans grew 2.7% to $460 billion. Commercial loans grew 10% to $456.6 billion.Wells' net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn in loans vs. what they pay out to depositors, slipped to 2.92% from the third quarter's 2.96% and 3.04% a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's decision to boost interest rates by 0.25% last month — the first interest rate hike since 2006 — is seen as helping boost banks' profitability. But the brutal start to the year for stocks, weak global growth and underwhelming inflation numbers could mean that further hikes could be delayed.The sagging energy sector also weighed on Wells Fargo to some degree. The San Francisco-based bank reported $831 million in credit losses in the fourth quarter, up 18.2% from the quarter before, primarily due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses as well as seasonal increases in non-real estate consumer portfolios. Costs decreased 2% to $12.4 billion from $12.65 billion, reflecting savings on employee benefits and commissions.Shares tumbled 4.2% to 48.51 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo's IBD Composite Rating is 64 out of 99, meaning it is outperforming 64% of other publicly traded companies. It is trading well below its 50-day moving average, and that fell below its 200-day line back in September.Meanwhile, Citigroup reported quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share, also beating views by a penny. The New York-based bank earned 6 cents a share in the year-ago quarter because of legal expenses. Revenue rose 4% to $18.6 billion, beating estimates of $17.9 billion. Full-year EPS was $5.35 a share, missing views by 9 cents, but during the year the bank earned $17.2 billion, its biggest profit in nearly a decade. For all of 2014, Citigroup earned $2.20 a share. Full-year revenue fell 1.5% to $76.1 billion, but beat estimates of $75.6 billion.Allowance for loan losses was $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter, or 2.1% of total loans. A year earlier, that total was $16 billion, or $2.5% of total loans. Citi set aside $250 million to cover losses to its energy portfolio.Operating expenses fell 23% to $11.1 billion, driven by lower legal costs. Loans fell 4% to $618 billion while deposits rose 1% to $908 billion. Net interest margins slipped to 2.92% compared with 2.94% in the third quarter.Profit at Citi Holdings, Citigroup's ""bad bank"" that has housed the company's sour assets since the 2008-09 financial crisis, soared to $704 million from $87 million a year earlier, thanks in part to the sale of OneMain Financial Group, Citi's subprime lending unit. Net income at Citi's global banking unit fell 20% to $1.3 billion and income from its institutional clients group dropped 18% to $1.4 billion.Citi has sought to become leaner and meaner since the financial crisis. It has sold off a number of its overseas assets in order to slim down. Total assets as of Dec. 31 were $1.7 trillion, putting it behind Wells Fargo in that department.Citi's shares sank 6.5% to 42.43, well below its 50-day line, which fell below its 200-day moving average in October. Its IBD Composite Rating is 48.Elsewhere, U.S. Bancorp earned 80 cents a share for the quarter, up 1.3% and beating views by a penny. Revenue fell 0.2% to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $5.1 billion. Full-year EPS was $3.16, up 2.6% from the previous year, matching views. Full-year revenue rose 2.5% to $20.1 billion, missing views of $20.2 billion.The Minneapolis-based bank earned $294 million in fees from credit and debit cards, up 8.1% and helping to offset declines in mortgage banking and investment product revenue.Net interest margin rose to 3.06% compared with the third quarter's 3.04%, but fell from Q4 2014's 3.14%. Average total loans grew 4.2% from a year earlier to $256.7 billion while total deposits grew 6.9% to $294.5 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets were $421.9 billion, up 4.8%.U.S. Bancorp.'s provision for credit losses rose 5.9% to $305 million. The allowance for credit losses was $4.3 billion, down 1.6% from a year earlier.Shares fell 3% to 38.72, well below its 50-day average. U.S. Bancorp's IBD Composite Rating is 64.Finally, PNC Financial Services Group earned $1.87 a share, up 1.6% year over year and beating quarterly views by 7 cents. Revenue fell 2.4% to $3.9 billion, beating estimates of $3.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $7.39 a share, up 1.2% from 2014, and beat views by 9 cents. Full-year revenue was $15.2 billion, a 1% decline, but ahead of estimates of $15.1 billion.The Pittsburgh-based bank's net interest margin was 2.7%, down from 2.89% a year earlier, but an improvement over the third quarter's 2.67%. Total assets were $358.5 billion as of Dec. 31, up 3.9% from a year earlier. Total loans grew 1% to $206.7 billion. Total deposits grew 7% to $249 billion.Provisions for credit losses were $74 million compared to the third quarter's $81 million while PNC's allowance for loan and lease losses fell 18% to $2.7 billion.Shares fell 1.4% to 85.66, below both their 50- and 200-day moving averages.

663,WFC,"And the FLUSH continues......by now I am even wondering....who is the TAIL wagging the DOG?   Have we just allowed the roles to reverse?  Can the Chinese stock mkt really hold this much sway over global mkts?   I mean - it's the Chinese stock mkt..... it says nothing about the state of the Chinese economy.......their mkt is not connected to their economy the way Europe and the US is.....I mean our mkts are developed, liquid and thick......everything the China mkt is NOT.(Let me remind you....it is an EMERGING mkt, not very thick and not very liquid, difficult to trade and subject to rule set changes on the fly......)That being said - the Chinese economy IS important to the global economy - no doubt - but my argument is that the Chinese economy is NOT nearly as gloomy as the most recent performance of the Shanghei Index.The Shanghei Index shot up 40% from February 2015 to June 2015   (4 months),  the same move in the S&P at that time would have meant....we went from 2,020 to 2,828  - a bit ridiculous no and very unlikely...............and it was not like the concerns about a slowing China did not exist.....they  did - but no one seemed to care......Chinese RETAIL investors  and some global asset managers were tripping over each other to buy stocks as the search for yield continued..........So what happened?  Well - oil started to crack in June -  when it was trading at $60/barrel, global investment banks began to forecast a break in oil and concerns over weaker commodities, concerns over a slowing Europe (or so they told us), and the increasing likelihood of a change in US FED policy etc. all contributed to a change in mind set.........Aisle 1 - REALITY CHECK!So as the global weakness story builds - they start to run for exits - the Chinese authorities then impose new regulations on the fly....causing more anxiety and  concern.....so that 40% move higher in 4 months does a 180 and collapses under its own weight - taking that mkt right back to where it was almost 1 yr ago....but has the Chinese economy story really changed that much?  No - and that was made clear in the Alcoa  (AA) earnings on Monday......Klaus Kleinfeld is looking at China as an opportunity and not as a drag on his businesses....What will other earnings reports say?  We are about to find out......In spite of deeply oversold mkt, investors continue to be fearful..... The fear trade continues to be gain momentum  - 'selling begets more selling......and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy...... fear of the 'possible' of weak earnings, fear of an imploding China (unlikely), fear of the FED (overblown), fear of a slowing Europe (in fact not happening),  never mind fear over renewed geo-political issues - all coming together - to paint a picture of doom and gloom.....Remember - mkts tend to overshoot especially when the HERD mentality takes over.....Technically, the S&P is now testing the August lows and is in a deeply oversold  condition.  Note that on January 8th - the 50 dma crossed over the 200 dma - sending out that 'death cross' signal......an indicator that signals a bear mkt on the horizon.....but I have found that by the time the death cross happens - most of the move lower has already happened and in fact it tends to find support and begin the process of repair......I am still willing to bet that this will be the case here as well....That does not mean it rallies right back to S&P 2000. it just means that it churns as the mkt assesses the latest damage vs. the outlook........and the outlook  will become  clearer over the next couple of weeks as the qtrly confessional period heats up.......... Earnings will have to completely blow up for the mkt to implode....Speaking of -

666,WFC,"Now on the bright side - think  about all the benefits that will accrue to so many industries with lower commodity prices - and that is across the board....lower lumber, copper, steel, along with oil... Housing, construction, manufacturing, consumer retail - discretionary and non-discretionary.... at some point - all the weakness has to translate into a positive for so many industries -  and for the long term investor that has the vision and the iron stomach - this may very prove to be a silver lining.......Now - we need leaders - in DC on BOTH sides of the aisle -  that can institute solid fiscal policy initiatives that will take advantage of this opportunity.Tonight is another GOP debate - FOX is culling the field....Tonight will only feature the top 7 - Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Bush, Kasich, Christie and Carson and out of that group the focus will be on the expected fight between Trump and Cruz.....Get the popcorn....

671,WFC,"Special Report: Personal Finance Action Plan For 2016ETFs are investing sledgehammers, opening up wide swathes of global regions or asset classes in one fell blow. They're equally precision tools, allowing investors to make tactical sector bets, to equitize cash or to hedge against market declines.That malleable quality is a key reason why exchange traded funds continue to blast their way into investors' strategies.Perhaps you're hearing about ETFs for the first time. Or maybe you're fine-tuning your financial action plan for 2016. As you check on your investing progress last year or prime your portfolio for the new one, ETFs are certainly worth considering.The numbers speak for themselves.More than $201 billion in new money flowed into U.S. ETFs and exchange-traded products in the first 11 months of 2015, according to independent research firm ETFGI.com.That's up 5% from last year's record asset-gathering pace for the same period.Unsurprisingly, more and more money managers want to get in on the ETF game, says Matt Hougan, CEO of ETF.com.""That trend has absolutely accelerated this year,"" he told IBD. ""It's actually breathtaking in its scope.""Goldman Sachs and John Hancock in October launched their first ETF products that aim to beat traditional indexes. Oppenheimer Funds, New York Life Investment Management and Janus Capital Group (JNS) bought out small ETF shops. T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Legg Mason (LM) have filed for the regulatory nod to offer ETFs. A unit of Eaton Vance (EV) plans to introduce a newfangled, hybrid ETF-mutual fund product.Hougan describes the trend as a matter of simple math. From 2009 to 2015, investors poured roughly $1.1 trillion in net new money into ETFs, while mutual funds absorbed $200 billion.""If you're the director at any major mutual fund company, you have to wake up every day asking yourself why,"" he said.Best-Performing ETFs Of 2015Investors scored big wins last year from small ETFs tapping into niche market segments.Market Vectors China AMC (CNXT) and Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 (ASHS) rocketed 43% and 28%, respectively.Both hold small-cap China A shares, listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Until quite recently, these equities could only be bought by Chinese citizens.Many successful investors also tapped into the potential of narrowly focused technology ETFs.First Trust Dow Jones Internet (FDN) soared 22% in 2015.KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) jumped 18%.FDN has massive stakes in IBD Leaderboard stocks Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Online retailer Amazon was a standout stock of 2015, more than doubling in price as it reinvents itself as a powerhouse in cloud computing and on-demand video streaming.Meanwhile, KWEB holds Chinese giants Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD).The ETF also has smaller companies with stellar IBD ratings such as NetEase (NTES), Qihoo 360 (QIHU) and TAL Education (XRS).Investors did much better with large-cap ETFs last year than with small-cap peers.Several winners are ""smart beta"" ETFs, which aim to outperform traditional benchmarks.Among them, iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) and iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) withstood a choppy and challenging year for the stock market.The trio leaped 9%, 6% and 6%, respectively.By comparison, traditional, cap-weighted ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index advanced 1%.International ETFs got beat up in 2015.The iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), holding developed market stocks, shed 1%. The iShares Emerging Markets (EEM) sank 16%.Outlook And PositioningExpect smart beta products to continue to find their way into investors' ETF strategies in 2016.A recent BlackRock (BLK) iShares report on institutional investors' use of ETFs found 19% of respondents were likely to use smart beta ETFs this year.Only 10% reported allocating to the asset class in 2015.Volatility was the main concern for investors, the report found.Smart beta ETFs can be an effective way to manage volatility, says Heidi Richardson, head of U.S. investment strategy for iShares.These strategies rejigger the traditional rules of index investing to boost returns or reduce risk.Rather than weighting holdings by market capitalization, smart beta ETFs select and weight stocks using alternative methods.For example, iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF holds stocks with less downside risk.And iShares MSCI Quality Factor ETF aims to enhance returns — it holds U.S. stocks with high return on equity, stable earnings growth and low levels of debt.Investors could ""pair the two"" for better risk-adjusted returns, while getting broad exposure to the U.S. stock market, Richardson told IBD in a phone call.In contrast, an S&P 500-tracking ETF would match the returns of the broad market with the same amount of volatility.The iShares report also found investors are using ETFs in almost equal measure for tactical bets and strategic allocations.An ETF such as iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) could serve as the foundation of one's portfolio, Richardson said.IVV basically replicates the broad market for a razor-thin 0.07% expense ratio. That's $7 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested.Then investors could get more tactical with ETFs, Richardson added.With interest rates set to rise in steps in 2016, cyclical sectors such as financial services and technology may hold better opportunities.Many tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), are flush with cash. As a result, they are less vulnerable to increasing rates than, say, debt-loaded utilities.They can continue to roll out shareholder-friendly M&As, share buybacks and dividends.Unlike some peers, iShares U.S. Technology (IYW) is a pure-play technology ETF with almost no exposure to indebted telecom firms.Financial firms such as Wells Fargo (WFC) also benefit from rising rates. They're able to charge clients more on loans, boosting net interest margins.Investors could also consider overweighting positions in Japan and Europe as those countries stimulate their economies, Richardson said.""You can make an active decision about where the market is going to go to generate alpha,"" she added.Fixed-income investors may want to consider defined maturity bond ETFs, short duration ETFs and bond-laddering ETF investing strategies.""They hold attractive opportunities"" in a rising rate environment if you can live with some volatility, Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim Investments, said during a Dec. 18 media call.

692,WFC,"Nicole Bennett wanted to pull cash out of her house in Antioch, Calif., to reduce a growing mound of debt. When Bennett's mortgage lender, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), refused the social worker because her credit score was too low, she turned to a technology startup called Point Digital Finance.
"
693,WFC,"In October, Bennett got the almost $40,000 she needed to pay down debt that was costing her more than $1,900 a month in car, personal-loan and credit-card payments. In return, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Point — which is backed by investors including Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive officer of Citigroup Inc. (C) — wanted to own a piece of her property.
"
694,WFC,"""I have all this equity in my house, but I couldn't use it because of my credit score,"" said Bennett, whose FICO score was less than 600, on a scale of 300 to 850. ""I can breathe now because all my money isn't going out the door.""
"
695,WFC,"Financing to homeowners is loosening up after a 30% increase in property values nationally since the 2012 trough. While many lenders have been letting the most credit-worthy borrowers tap their homes' equity, Point is targeting customers who have been largely unable to trade accumulated wealth for cash or don't want to take on the additional monthly payments associated with traditional loan s.
"
696,WFC,"In the years leading up to the real estate crash, easy financing helped people buy homes they couldn't afford and then borrow against their equity as property prices rose. The collapse in home values ripped through banks that bought mortgage securities, helping trigger the U.S. recession. At Citigroup, CEO Charles O. ""Chuck"" Prince was ousted in 2007 in the face of mounting losses tied to subprime mortgages and replaced by Pandit, who himself left three years ago.
"
697,WFC,"Since home prices bottomed in 2012, banks have reduced the percentage of cash that borrowers can take out when refinancing and tightened credit standards for home-equity lines of credit, HELOCs — requiring higher FICO scores and full documentation.
"
698,WFC,"A typical HELOC is a second mortgage, repaid monthly with interest, that homeowners can use in full or draw on as needed. Point is making an investment in the form of equity, so customers have no obligation to pay the firm back until they sell or refinance their homes, for as long as a decade.

699,WFC,"That type of funding could ultimately cause financial issues for the homeowner, said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy at the Center for American Progress.

700,WFC,"The Risk For Consumers
"
701,WFC,"""While it may be appealing to get an upfront lump sum of cash, the risk here appears to be that a consumer could end up with a more expensive product with harsher repayment terms than they would with a more conventional loan,"" said Edelman, whose Washington-based policy institute promotes economic mobility.
"
702,WFC,"Many Americans with high debt-to-income ratios and low credit scores have limited financing options. For personal loans, both LendingClub (LC) and Prosper Marketplace customers have average credit scores of 700 or above. And the traditional home-equity lending market has been open primarily to borrowers with good credit.
"
703,WFC,"""The home-equity market is still very restrictive,"" said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for personal-finance data provider Bankrate (RATE), adding that FICO scores are a key factor in determining whether a person qualifies for financing. ""It starts getting tougher below 680. Below 620 it is both really hard and really expensive.""
"
704,WFC,"With Point, credit scores can be less than 620, but homeowners must have at least 25% to 30% equity in their houses. Point adjusts the cost of its investment based on the owner and the property, taking a larger percentage of price appreciation from riskier customers. Should the homeowner not pay Point, the firm has the right to sell the home to recoup its investment and take its portion of the gains.
"
705,WFC,"Those deciding not to sell their homes have to pay Point back at the end of the 10-year period, similar to a loan, with an annual effective interest rate that's capped at about 15%, comparable to rates on some credit cards or unsecured consumer debt. Annual rates at LendingClub range from 5.32% to almost 30% on three-year personal loans.

707,WFC,"Point is investing in properties it expects to appreciate in value, initially focusing on California, with plans to fund homeowners in other states next year, according to a company marketing document.

"
709,WFC,"For investors, the firm is trying to unlock some of the equity in residential real estate and make it a more liquid asset class that can be traded, Lim said. He's raised money from investors — separate from the company's venture-capital backers — to fund the equity products. The firm already is selling them to family offices and hedge funds that buy residential-mortgage bonds and has plans to securitize them as well.

710,WFC,"Seeking Financial Stability

711,WFC,"Part of Point's plan is to improve the financial stability of its customers because the firm transfers funds directly to pay off their debts, according to the marketing document. Other backers of the company, which Lim started in January, include Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and Bloomberg Beta, the venture-capital arm of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.

712,WFC,"Point's customers, aside from Bennett, include homeowners such as an Apple (AAPL) employee who makes $128,700 a year and owns a Mountain View, Calif., house appraised at $1.38 million, according to the firm's marketing document. The logistics program manager, who owes about $715,525 on the property and has a credit score of 644, wanted $85,000 from Point to pay off debt from home renovations, the document shows.

722,WFC,"On a recent afternoon in Prince George's County, Md., a bleak economic trend met a tantalizing investment thesis. Inside the community center at the Regency Pointe Apartments, a complex of 599 units set in low-slung buildings about 20 minutes from Washington, D.C., nurses from a nearby medical clinic were screening residents for cholesterol and high blood pressure.Just outside, a Zumba instructor was leading two dozen neighborhood children in an exercise class. A uniformed Sheriff's Department officer looked on, chatting with residents and tracking police radio reports that a suspect wielding an AR-15 assault rifle was wandering nearby streets.It's part of an effort by Turner Impact Capital, which acquired the property in June, to make money for investors while keeping rents stable for low-income residents. At Regency Pointe, the typical renter earns less than 80% of the area median income, and the average two-bedroom unit costs less than $1,200 a month.Since launching the Santa Monica, Calif., firm last year, Bobby Turner has used a two-pronged appeal as he seeks to raise $300 million to sink into affordable housing, from investors including the University of Michigan endowment and Citi Community Capital, which invests in community development for Citigroup.The pitch: The fund will help fill a pressing need to preserve affordable apartments in places like Prince George's County, where 4 out of 10 renters spend more than 35% of their income on rent. At the same time, it will target returns of 10% to 12%.That's a far more modest return than what investors look for in traditional real estate funds, which can shoot for 20% or so, but Turner says it can be a hedge against higher-yielding investments. Luxury construction projects typically need a rising economic tide to lift affluent renters or condo buyers into increasingly expensive apartments — and get hit hardest when the economy sours. Turner's model doesn't depend on that tide. Because there's a shortage of housing affordable to poor and working-class renters, the theory goes, landlords committed to keeping rents cheap won't have to lower them in a bad economy.""The vast majority of real estate investors are speculators, hoping someone will patronize stores or buy their condos,"" he said. ""Social impact is not speculating.""Turner, 52, said he began to see the social potential of real estate investing in the 1990s when he was part of a group of investors that bought a former wire factory in New York City's East Harlem neighborhood and transformed it into a shopping mall. Later, he raised $2 billion with basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson to invest in inner-city real estate projects. In 2013, he left Canyon Capital Realty Advisors, where he had overseen a $12 billion real estate portfolio, to focus on social impact investing, which he said offers a better way to create change than pure philanthropy.'Emerging Middle Ground'In addition to rental apartments, Turner Impact is set up to invest in health care facilities in underserved areas and is seeking to raise $400 million to invest in charter schools with retired tennis star Andre Agassi.That model places the firm among a group of 16 leading social impact real estate investors that have launched funds aiming to raise more than $3 billion. They have already acquired, rehabilitated or developed more than 60,000 apartments for poor and working-class tenants, according to a forthcoming report from the Urban Land Institute (ULI), a nonprofit research group. They include below-market debt funds, which offer low-cost loans to entice property owners to keep rents low, and real estate investment trusts seeded by charitable foundations, as well as private equity funds like Turner.""There is this emerging middle ground between traditional subsidized and market-rate housing,"" said Stockton Williams, the author of the ULI report. ""These are investors who see an economic rationale for keeping apartments affordable for blue- collar tenants.""One such equity fund, Irvine, Calif.-based Avanath Capital Management, specializes in rent-regulated apartments whose construction was funded by the U.S. government's Low Income Housing Tax Credit program.By contrast, Turner is aiming to preserve what the industry calls naturally occurring affordable housing — cheap rentals that are cheap because of where they're located or how they were built, not because of government subsidy programs. Which makes him sound like an environmental activist.Good Returns, Positive ChangeSixty thousand units is a drop in the bucket, with 11.8 million U.S. households currently spending more than half of their income on rent, according to a recent estimate by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. And the rent squeeze could get even worse, given projections for increased renter demand. The supply of affordable housing could take another hit, with 400,000 government-subsidized rental units eligible to be converted to market-rate rentals or condominiums by the end of 2017.A group of 146 investors surveyed by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) expects to allocate $12.2 billion to impact investment funds this year, up 16% from last year. Since the recession, banks have shown interest in funds dedicated to preserving affordable housing as a way of meeting their obligations under the federal Community Reinvestment Act.""These funds are producing good returns, doing it in a way that's having a positive impact,"" said Tim Rafalovich, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo (WFC), who manages about $60 million of investments in private equity vehicles that preserve affordable housing. ""We'd like to deploy more, but there's not as many funds as we'd like to see on the market.""As these funds seek to expand, here's one big challenge: The same rising rents driving them to keep units affordable are also attracting interest from more traditional real estate funds, which seek to buy, renovate, and jack up rents.""How do we continue to compete with the conventional acquirer?"" asked Chris Herrmann, who manages a $35 million fund for Enterprise Community Investment, which seeks 7% returns for its investors in properties that are affordable to renters earning less than 80% of the area median income.Increasing The AppealThat's where the health screenings and fitness classes come in. To goose returns, Turner is making small investments to make the complex a more appealing place to live, sponsoring community activities and offering free and reduced rents to teachers, nurses and police officers — who are in turn expected to organize services like a neighborhood watch or tutoring sessions.""If you do that, you dissuade gangbangers, prostitutes and drug dealers from doing business on your property,"" he said. By offering free or reduced rent on 3% of units, he thinks that he can increase profit margins by 15% to 20%.Like everything about the model, it's easier said than done. Raymond Appling, 47, said he's been through six ownerships during two decades living at Regency Pointe.""The new owners always come in making promises,"" he said, as his son and daughter talked with friends at a recent community fair. ""If they can build on this, that will be a good start.""

723,WFC,"The prospect of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike does have a bright side in some circles of the economy, as it has helped propel regional banks to rank among the stock market's best performers in recent weeks.Of the 197 industries tracked by Investor's Business Daily, 4 of the 13 highest-rated are regional banking groups from the Southeast, Midwest, West/Southwest and Northeast. Along with the prospect of a rate hike, these banks have also benefited from a strong commercial loan environment in many parts of the country.Among stocks, leaders include Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Home Bancshares (HOMB), First Citizens Bancshares (FCNCA), PrivateBancorp (PVTB), Signature Bank (SBNY) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW).With rising share prices and strong financial growth in recent quarters, these firms thrived even before chatter arose that the Fed will raise interest rates this month after years of keeping rates near zero to bolster the economy. If the Fed does raise rates, regional banks should get an additional lift.Feeling The Fed MoreSmaller banks tend to benefit more from higher rates than industry giants like Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan (JPM), analysts say. The reason is regional banks rely more on spread income — the difference between assets such as loans and securities and the cost of deposits and other funds — than big banks, which have a bigger focus on trading and investment banking.""Depending on how their balance sheets are structured, they could see more of a benefit from changes in margins and changes in interest rates,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Zabora told IBD.D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner agrees regional banking groups have moved higher on expectations of an interest rate hike.""There's an expectation that it could occur in December, and that it will be a gradual and moderate pace of increase,"" Tenner told IBD. ""It's not a huge tailwind, but the current market psychology around banks has certainly been a positive.""Economy TiesAnother positive is that regional banks are more tied to the U.S. economy than large international players like BofA and Citigroup, which have much more exposure to the global economy. The relative strength of the U.S. economy vs. other countries partly explains why regional banks are doing better financially than large banks.Most of the big players have struggled to produce consistent revenue and earnings growth. In contrast, top regional banks have strung together at least a couple years' worth of double-digit revenue and earnings growth.Financial results have been particularly robust in regions of the country where commercial lending and housing are strong. Tenner's coverage universe stretches mainly from Texas to California, where he says net loan growth has been strong for a couple of years.""The growth has predominately been in commercial real estate,"" Tenner said. ""Multifamily lending has been a particularly strong driver in California.""Single-family home loans have been another growth catalyst for regional banks in certain areas of the country, Zabora says.""It really depends on the region,"" he said. ""In Southern California, regional banks have shown good loan growth. Bank of the Ozarks has a national lending platform, and that's been a nice source of strong loan growth for them. (Arkansas-based) Home BancShares did a lot of acquisitions in Florida, where there's some construction going on and commercial activity is better than it was a couple years ago.""Acquisitions have been a big part of the growth story for many regional banks. Home BancShares, parent of Centennial Bank, now has 56 branches in Florida, thanks to an aggressive buyout program there.Bank of the Ozarks has made more than a dozen acquisitions over the past five years to extend its reach, particularly in the Southeast. Its latest buyout came in October, when it announced plans to acquire Atlanta-based Community & Southern Holdings and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Community & Southern Bank, for around $800 million.Also in October, PacWest finalized its $850 million buyout of Square 1 Financial, a North Carolina-based banking company with a heavy focus on venture capital loans used to finance tech startups.Even with those and other deals, 2015 hasn't been an especially busy year for mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry, Tenner says.""M&A activity has been fairly steady the last few years,"" he said. ""You generally see anywhere from 230 to 250 M&A transactions per year within the bank space, and I don't know that it's deviated much from that year to date.""He doesn't see a big change in 2016 either, in terms of the number of deals. But there is one thing that's different about the current round of deals.""M&A valuations have picked up from what they were a couple years ago, so that might play a part in some of the rising stock valuations we've seen,"" Tenner said.

725,WFC,"With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.
"
726,WFC,"A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.
"
727,WFC,"They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).
"
728,WFC,"Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.
"
729,WFC,"Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.
"
730,WFC,"Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.
"
731,WFC,"Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.
"
732,WFC,"But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.
"
733,WFC,"In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.
"
734,WFC,"""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""
"
735,WFC,"Record Buyback Pace
"
736,WFC,"What's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.
"
737,WFC,"The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.
"
738,WFC,"The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.
"
739,WFC,"""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""
"
740,WFC,"A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.
"
741,WFC,"In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.
"
742,WFC,"FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.
"
743,WFC,"The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
744,WFC,"Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.
"
745,WFC,"Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?
"
746,WFC,"The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.
"
747,WFC,"""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""
"
748,WFC,"In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say. In others, executives are simply gun-shy about investing in products and services that might not pay off over the long term.
"
749,WFC,"Another reason some companies are buying back outstanding shares is that doing so fattens up per-share earnings.
"
750,WFC,"Innovation Shortchanged?
"
751,WFC,"The worry in some quarters is that buybacks come at the expense of product development, innovation and long-term growth.
"
752,WFC,"""The U.S. is behind on production of everything from flat-panel TVs to semiconductors and solar photovoltaic cells,"" Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School, told Reuters. He's also the author of ""Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance.""
"
753,WFC,"Reuters reported that among the 1,000 or so firms it tracked that buy back shares and report R&D spending, the share of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50% since 2009. That com pares to over 60% during the 1990s.
"
754,WFC,"But not all data show such a grim view, Arone said. ""There's a bunch of data showing R&D growing at its fastest level in 50 years. There's this misperception that companies are not reinvesting or spending on business growth. But many companies do continue to reinvest in their businesses.""
"
755,WFC,"He also says that while buybacks can boost a company's EPS, research from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that on a weighted basis, recent S&P 500 EPS gains ""are built on profits — not buybacks.""
"
756,WFC,"A recent report from Deutsche Bank found that S&P 500 per-share profits since 2012 have risen by 6.2% annually on average, of which just 1.6 percentage points are from buybacks. That fell to 1.2 points in Q3.
"
757,WFC,"Misperceptions about buybacks are due to a couple of factors, Arone says.
"
758,WFC,"""Global economic growth has been sluggish, and therefore folks equate that sluggishness with a lack of business investment,"" he said. ""There's also been a lack of any meaningful wage growth. There's this view that we would be accelerating much more quickly had businesses been investing more, but I'm not convinced that's accurate.""
"
759,WFC,"If economic growth is sluggish, the return on capital may be low, so returning cash to shareholders may be a sound decision.
"
760,WFC,"That's not to say there aren't cases where companies issue buybacks and dividends at their detriment.
"
761,WFC,"""If a company is borrowing aggressively or levering its balance sheet to buy back stock, that is not necessarily a good strategy,"" Arone said. ""Or if a company buys back its stock to offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation of employees, that's not a good strategy, either.""
"
762,WFC,"But those are the exceptions rather than the rule, he said.

763,WFC,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains.

Nominal wage gains have picked up, but low inflation is the biggest reason for the solid real pay gain. That should support consumer spending. On the downside, as inflation picks up, real pay increases likely will moderate unless nominal wage gains accelerate.Core inflation held just below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, while core services inflation crept up to the highest since 2008, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. As energy stops being a drag on consumer prices, overall inflation likely will ramp up quickly, giving Fed policymakers reason to act soon.Consumer prices rose 0.2% in October after two months of declines, as energy prices edged up 0.3%. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, climbed 0.2% for a second straight month.Higher interest rates should be good news for profits at Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and more.The overall consumer price index rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier after being flat in September. Core inflation remained at 1.9% for the second straight month, though it edged up fractionally for a fifth straight month.Goods prices fell 3.4% vs. a year earlier, largely reflecting a 17.1% plunge in energy prices. But the over the next few months, that energy decline will likely moderate substantially, reflecting plunging crude oil costs in late 2014 to early 2015.Meanwhile, services prices rose 2.4% vs. a year earlier, the most this year. Services inflation excluding energy crept up to 2.8%, the highest since November 2008.With underlying inflation edging higher and energy deflation about to wind down, the Fed likely will see today's CPI report as another reason to begin raising interest rates at the December meeting.As New York Fed President William Dudley said last week, ""I don't favor waiting until I see the whites of inflation's eyes.""Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have generally outperformed the overall market since the Fed's relatively hawkish statement on Oct. 28, followed by other Fed hints of a looming rate ""liftoff.""

775,WFC,"A few years makes a big difference. That's the key lesson — and the key benefit — in the latest annual retirement study by Wells Fargo (WFC).
"
776,WFC,"The earlier you start, the easier it is to build a big retirement account.
"
777,WFC,"But wait — you already knew that, you say? OK, but did you know how big of a benefit to your retirement planning it is to start as soon as possible?
"
778,WFC,"Seeing how big the benefit is might give you the added motivation that you need to take advantage of key steps.
"
779,WFC,"Wells Fargo found that the median savings of working Americans age 55 to 59 is $150,000.
"
780,WFC,"That's three times greater than the median of $50,000 for workers who are age 60 or older.
"
781,WFC,"How have the younger workers managed to save more even though they've been in the work force a shorter time?
"
782,WFC,"They actually started to save earlier.
"
783,WFC,"The younger workers started saving at age 31 on average. That's six years earlier than the older workers, who began at age 37 on average.
"
784,WFC,"So the younger workers' savings have had six more years to mushroom, thanks to compound earnings growth. Compound growth is the key to their dramatically greater success as investors.
"
785,WFC,"The bulk of assets in retirement accounts is in mutual funds.
"
786,WFC,"The Wells Fargo study also casts a spotlight on another way to turbocharge your retirement nest egg: Sock away dough in your 401(k).
"
787,WFC,"The benefit is clear in the dollars and cents.
"
788,WFC,"People who have been saving for retirement since they started working and who have access to a 401(k) plan:
"
789,WFC,"Have saved four times as much for retirement — a median nest egg of $200,000 — as workers who also started early, but have not had access to a 401(k).
"
790,WFC,"Of those ""consistent"" savers with 401(k) access:
"
791,WFC,"A big majority — 84% — feel more secure about their retirement.
"
792,WFC,"More than 6 in 10, or 61%, say that they will be able to save enough through their 401(k) to live comfortably in retirement.
"
793,WFC,"Among the reasons that 401(k) plans are helpful is because they automate workers' savings, many provide a company match, and workers tend to save a higher percentage of their pay when they use a 401(k) account than when they do not.
"
794,WFC,"Wells Fargo is in the 401(k) business. It operates 3,598 defined contribution plans, which include 401(k) plans, with 3.3 million participants and a combined total of $213.3 billion in assets.

834,WFC,"The Federal Reserve Board proposed long-awaited rules for reining in losses from institutions deemed ""too big to fail."" It requires the eight largest banks to raise a total of $120 billion in debt that could be converted into equity in a crisis.New guidelines, known as ""total loss-absorbing capacity,"" or TLAC, will increase the amount of capital, defined as a combination of shareholder equity and debt, that large banks will need to have. Regulators believe that banks need bigger cushions in case of crises like the one in 2008 that required taxpayer bailouts.The Fed set the TLAC at a minimum 18% of risk-weighted assets. Banks affected by the rules will have until January 2022 to comply, although a months-long comment period will occur before the Fed issues a final rule.Some of the largest banks will need to have more capacity. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest by assets, will see its ratio rise to 23.5%. Citigroup (C) will have a 21.5% minimum.

Industrial segment operating margins jumped 100 basis points to 17.3%.Revenue fell 22.7% to $27.9 billion, missing views of $28.6 billion, as revenue from the oil and gas unit tumbled 16% to $3.9 billion. But GE's power and water revenue rose 1% to $6.5 billion. Aviation revenue climbed 5% to $6 billion, transportation grew 3% to $1.6 billion, and appliances rose 8% to $2.3 billion.Industrial backlog rose 5% to $270 billion, while orders tumbled 26% to $23.2 billion.GE shares closed up 3.4% to 28.98 in the stock market today.Earlier this month, Trian disclosed a $2.5 billion stake in GE, after acquiring 98.5 million shares. The fund, which is headed by Nelson Peltz, is largely onboard with GE's industrial focused strategy, but said it wants management ""to deliver on its commitments.""Trian also wants GE to expand its margins, explore more share buybacks, be disciplined in its acquisitions and mull additional ways to consider scaling back GE Capital.GE CFO Jeff Bornstein told the Financial Times Friday that the company is open to borrowing money to buy back shares.Meanwhile, Bornstein told Bloomberg that GE is exploring up to $10 billion in dealmaking in order to boost its newly created digital unit. Whether that fits into Peltz's vision of more disciplined M&A remains to be seen.The company has heeded the urging of investors as well as its own desire to avoid tougher federal financial regulations. This month, it sold $32 billion worth of assets in commercial lending and leasing to Wells Fargo (WFC). It has $126 billion in total signed deals to date, GE CEO Jeff Immelt said in a statement.GE also is launching a share exchange to spin off Synchrony Financial (SYF), its consumer finance subsidiary, next week. The company plans to return $30 billion to shareholders next year via share buybacks and dividend payouts.Synchrony shares finished down 3.7% to 30.15 Friday after reporting quarterly results. Wells Fargo shares edged up 0.4% to 52.88.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.

849,WFC,"New highs can tell an individual investor a lot about the market, a sector and a stock. IBD's list doesn't include stocks trading under 10 a share or trailing more than 40% of the market in earnings performance. This is appropriate because there's little to gain by buying low-priced junk.Or as a comedian said about the junk-bond fiasco of the late 1980s: Shouldn't the word ""junk"" have been a clue?Here are four ways to gain quality market clues from IBD's new highs list. The overall tally: Intraday Tuesday, new highs had an edge over new lows. In a healthy market, combined new highs (Nasdaq + NYSE) lead new lows by a wide margin.From July through September, total new lows dominated new highs. This was a bad sign. Beginning in October, the balance shifted. In the first 14 sessions of October, new highs led in 11 sessions.However, the new-highs tally — which recently has been barely scoring triple digits — could use a boost. Sector representation: Early Tuesday, real estate investment trusts and insurance were scoring the most new highs. The medical sector had the most new lows.This is a good way, though not a conclusive way, to look for signs of sector rotation. Reversals: April 2014 initial public offering Paycom Software (PAYC) posted a new high early Tuesday and then reversed to close off 2.27 at 38.57 in triple its usual volume. Facebook (FB) also reversed, closing down 1.47 to 97 after being up 1% in early trade. Volume, though, was average.If a stock notches a new high and then reverses in fast trade, that's a bad sign. In many cases, though, it's a reflection of the overall market. The Nasdaq early Tuesday also made a gain and then reversed lower.Note that the list doesn't show reversals, so the individual investor might want to punch in some tickers to see how the stocks closed after hitting the new high. Volume: A new high made in low volume is a different story from one made in strong volume. The key, though, is not to make too much out of one day's action. Look for patterns. Is the stock making a batch of new highs in low volume, or is it just pausing? Has the stock scored several new highs in strong volume, or is this a one-shot deal?Click here to view the full list of 52-Week New Highs & Lows

"
854,WFC,"Revenue — and how to grow it — were the name of the game for Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) in Q3, and one bank succeeded where the other didn't.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo earned $1.05 a share, up 2.9% from a year earlier, on a profit of $5.8 billion. Earnings per share beat analysts' estimates by a penny. Revenue rose 2.6% to $21.9 billion, topping estimates of $21.8 billion.The bank's net interest margin fell 1 basis point from Q2 to 2.96%. A year earlier, that number was 3.06%. The net interest margin measures banks' profitability from interest charged on loans vs. interest paid out in deposits. Banks' margins have been squeezed as the Federal Reserve has kept benchmark rates near zero since December 2008.Loans rose 7.7% year-over-year to $903.2 billion, with commercial and industrial lending up 15%, commercial real-estate mortgages up 8.2%, total consumer loans up 3%, and auto loans up 7.1%.Wells Fargo's mortgage business generated $1.6 billion in fees, down 2.7%. Total assets expanded by 7% to $1.8 trillion as of Sept. 30. Expenses grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion.Shares were down 0.7% to 51.50 in the stock market today.Wells Fargo has been buying some General Electric (GE) assets and recently announced the purchase of GE Capital's $30 billion commercial leasing and lending unit.

Residential mortgage and home-equity loan originations rose 13% to $17 billion. Excluding an accounting adjustment, trading revenue fell 3.8% to $3.2 billion — better than the predicted fall of 5% to 6%. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities sales and trading revenue dropped 11%, hurt by declines in credit-related businesses.Expenses sank 31% to $13.8 billion. Legal expenses plunged to $231 million from $6 billion a year earlier, primarily because of the $17 billion settlement Bank of America paid to regulators last year.BofA is seeking to boost its revenue while waiting for the Fed to raise rates. Cost-cutting has been among the methods applied.The bank's core net interest margin fell to 2.10% from 2.37% in Q2 and from 2.29% in Q3 2014.It was an eventful quarter for BofA, which saw its CEO Brian Moynihan successfully fight off an effort by some shareholders to strip him of his chairmanship. The bank also had to resubmit a stress test to the Federal Reserve.Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) will report third-quarter earnings Thursday.

895,WFC,"Like they say at the Opera - ""It ain't over till the fat lady sings"" Well - can you hear her singing? Greece and the EU strike an 11th hour deal! The Opera is over….or is it?
"
896,WFC,"(Who is kidding who? It's never over.)
"
897,WFC,"This morning global investors are waking up to the headlines:
"
898,WFC,"""Tsipras Capitulates to Creditor's Demands to Keep Greece in the Euro""
"
899,WFC,"""Greece and Eurozone Thrash out Rescue Deal""
"
900,WFC,"""Agreekment! Overnight Talks Result in Aid-for-Reform Deal""
"
901,WFC,"This is like a sequel to the 1994 comedy - ""Dumb and Dumber"" Only this one stars Alexis Tsipras and the whole Greek Parliament...I mean have you ever seen anything so breathtakingly stupid? Alexis Tsipras was elected on the platform of ""Screw the European Union"" - Remember - he was the one that claimed that he would not accept one more ounce of austerity, or cuts, or tax increases (not that anyone in Greece pays taxes - so what difference does that make?)
"
902,WFC,"Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down! We now have a new word that is sure to light up the Twitter sphere - ""Gridiot"".
"
903,WFC,"Paul Krugman - an American Economist and Professor of Economic and Int'l Affairs at Princeton University - summed it up this way:
"
904,WFC,"""This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can't accept; but even so, it's a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.""
"
905,WFC,"Global markets, now all relieved (at least for today), have moved into positive territory. Beginning in Asia - markets there sensing relief on the Greek front caused investors and traders to review recent market action. Add in some positive economic data across the region and it was Risk On. China - which has been the focus of late - reported trade figures showing that exports rose 2.8%, substantially beating the expectation of +0.2%.....on a side note - Gov't officials tried to temper the mood saying that 'exports are likely to face relatively big pressure in the coming months'. (Because - How long can they keep up this façade?)
"
906,WFC,"China ended the day up 2.4% extending Friday's gain of better than 6%. Clearly the market has been boosted by the recent 'reforms' instituted by Beijing….Brokerages were told in 'no uncertain terms' on Sunday to use real names and national identification numbers on all trades - Imagine that - no more imaginary brokerage accounts! Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices. Like I said last week - China is not a free market and while the measures recently imposed have caused the markets to rally - what happens once they are removed? Are foreign investors really feeling any better? Not so much….
"
907,WFC,"In Japan - money poured into the Yen - as the safe haven trade. Equities also moved higher as investors got the 'all clear' sign on a Greek deal while the GPIF (Gov't Pension Investment Fund) released performance figures showing a 12% return in the 12 months ended March 31st. Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?
"
908,WFC,"In Europe this morning - as you can imagine - markets there are on a tear….FTSE + 0.61%, CAC 40 + 1.78%, DAX +1.32%, EUROSTOXX +1.64%, SPAIN +1.25% and ITALY +1.26%. Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.
"
909,WFC,"German Chancellor Merkel had this to say: ""Trust has to be rebuilt, the Greek authorities have to take on responsibility for what they agreed to, It now hinges on step-by-step implementation of what we agreed.""
"
910,WFC,"And that agreement is for more spending cuts, pension cuts, and tax increases - everything that the country voted against.....Are you beginning to see the Dumb and Dumber reference?
"
911,WFC,"U.S. futures are soaring - currently up 14 points - at this rate we will be banging our heads on S&P 500 2100 before lunch. There are no economic reports for today but later in the week we get a slew of data points - Retail Sales, PPI, Empire State Manufacturing, Industrial Prod, and Capacity Utilization......
"
912,WFC,"We are now well into earnings season...Tomorrow starts the beauty pageant....JPMorgan (JPM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wells Fargo (WFC) - later in the week - we get US Bancorp (USB), Bank of America (BAC), CSX (CSX), Yum Brands (YUM) to name just a few.....The focus now will turn to the earnings and future guidance.....The Greek-think is a bit exhausting....but will remain simmering on the back burner.
"
913,WFC,"Look for the S&P 500 to test both the 100 and 50 DMA's (2095 & 2099). Those will be tough resistance points for the market to breach....that is where the economic data and earnings will play their part....Investors want to know if we are finally really making headway - Any perceived failure will cause markets to find support once again at 2056....
"
914,WFC,"This week also features an annual event - Semicon West (July 14-15th) - a 'must see' event - a two-day innovation conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco - featuring startups/investor and research forums.... Look for presentations from some of the big boys - IntelINTC, OracleORCL, IBMIBM, Texas InstrumentsTXN, San DiskSNDK along with some new and exciting startups - The market is sure to be getting all kinds of positive data and presentations coming out of this conference so expect positive market action in the publicly-traded names.

1001,WFC,"Four financial stocks are making a case that they've hit a bottom, but how convincing a case is it? U.S. Bancorp (USB), PNC Financial (PNC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Northern Trust (NTRS) haven't rallied much after the market's mini flash crash in the week that ended Aug. 28. But they haven't gone down much, either. Despite weak Accumulation/Distribution Ratings, all four are trading tightly, moving sideways and holding above their Aug. 24 lows, leaving some to believe that the selling has run its course.IBD tracks three of them in its Banks-Super Regional industry group. Wells Fargo is a member of the Banks-Money Center group.Interest rates will start heading higher at some point, which should help profitability at banks, thanks to higher net interest margin — the difference between interest income and the amount of interest paid out to lenders.U.S. Bancorp pays a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents a share, giving it an annualized dividend yield of around 2.5%. At an investor conference in mid-September, the company said that it would have to resort to cost-cutting initiatives if rates don't start rising soon.PNC Financial pays a quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share, giving it a yield of around 2.3%. As more and more consumers embrace mobile and the Internet for banking, PNC is redesigning many of its branches with financial consultants rather than tellers, who typically help with more mundane tasks.Wells Fargo's quarterly dividend of 37.5 cents a share gives it a yield of 2.9%. At the end of the second quarter, it was one of Warren Buffett's largest holdings.Northern Trust's dividend of 36 cents a share results in a yield of 2.1%. In terms of overall fundamentals, Northern Trust is the standout among the four. The company shows five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth.

Revenue fell 18.3% to $6.9 billion, missing views of $7.1 billion. That's the third time in four quarters that Goldman's revenue has declined.The volatile markets, fueled by concerns of slowdowns in China and other emerging markets, hurt a number of Goldman Sachs units during the quarter.

Total assets under supervision rose 3% to $1.2 trillion as of Sept. 30.Goldman shares rose 3% to close at 184.96 in the stock market today.

1014,WFC,"""It's reassuring to see JP Morgan make progress in getting smaller and simpler,"" emphasizing the fact that 'shrinking' could help increase their dividend and/or share buyback program by billions of dollars
"
1015,WFC,"On first blush the reported number was $1.32/sh vs. exp of $1.37....But if you add back in the tax benefit (some $2.2 bil) of shrinking their business then the reported number goes to $1.68 share. Revenues in the fixed income part of the business took a hit, but revenues from equity trading were up - given all the volatility of late. Return on equity ROSE to 12% vs. the 10% last year (this is a big positive).
"
1016,WFC,"""Client activity remained subdued across the credit markets particularly due to the uncertainty around interest rates,"" wrote Daniel Pinto, head of J.P. Morgan's corporate and investment bank, ""But volatility in the equity markets led to more client activity and another strong quarter for equities.""
"
1017,WFC,"And then CFO Marianne Lake chimes in that 'So far in October, markets are reasonably quiet suggesting that some analysts 4th q estimates may be too optimistic' And that was the line that sent the stock just a bit lower in post mkt trading...this morning the stock is trading at $60.75 down 0.80 cts from last night's close. All in all - this report was not bad and not unexpected....Based on the chart - I would expect to see JPM stabilize right here at the $60.50 level - but I suppose we will have to see how the others report.....
"
1018,WFC,"So far this morning BLK reported $5.02/sh vs. est of $4.53, BAC just reported $0.37/sh vs $0.35/sh - it is more of an expense cut story vs. a revenue growth story....but that is a direct result of zero interest rate policy..... and the devil will be in the details....early pre-mkt trading is sending that stock up just a bit..... WFC due out at 8 am.
"
1019,WFC,"DAL just reported $1.74 and they BEAT the est of $1.71...stock trading up .80 cts or 1.6%
"
1020,WFC,"INTC (reported last night) they beat on both earnings and revenues....$0.65 vs. $0.59 and $14.5 bil vs $14.2 bil....but they did talk down forward guidance a bit causing that stock to fall in premkt trading....currently trading down 0.60 cents at $31.40 as it tries to hold onto support at the 200 dma.
"
1021,WFC,"Now US futures had been down all morning in pre-mkt trading - but have now taken it all back and are about to turn up as these reports hit the tape. Eco data today includes RETAIL SALES and that will go right to the heart of the consumer. Exp are for +0.2%, ex autos and gas of +0.3%. PPI of -0.2% and ex food and energy of +0.1%......As long as these reports are what we expect then the mkts should not react negatively....if anything - it only supports 'looser for longer'...... I suspect that if we continue to get better earnings reports then the mkt will hold in....We may test support at 1990 and that's okay....in fact - we want to test to see if it holds.
"
1022,WFC,"(Look I know it's early...but of all the companies to report so far.....70% of them have 'beaten the earnings expectation' while 50% of them have beaten on revenues. It's like a broken record.......)
"
1023,WFC,"Yesterday stocks chopped around but managed to move a bit lower - as global mkts set the tone and investors/traders awaited the launch of earnings season. It is not uncommon to see the mkt rally as we go into earnings but then stumble when earnings are released, especially in a volatile, uncertain economic environment, hence will we get a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trading environment? Will we realize that the S&P is a bit 'overvalued' given the possible deterioration in earnings that we could see?
"
1024,WFC,"Look - China continues to be a pimple of the world's backside.....and last night - China did it again....reporting that 'factory - gate' prices slumped again (factory -gate prices?) .....CPI rose 'less than expected', and their PPI fell 5.9% - marking its 43rd month of decline....all this just adding to concerns that China is in trouble.......(not buying it....half the data we get from them is suspect to begin with and most of the data from years prior was inflated.)....and if it was really 'that bad' then equity mkts around the world would be acting very differently - I mean it's not like we haven't beaten this horse enough...........I'm just saying.....And if you think that China is a problem - then design your portfolio to eliminate or minimize that risk.
"
1025,WFC,"Is the US on the verge of a recession? Well that assumes that we never got out of it to begin with.......we tend to have recessions every 7 years, or at least that has been the cycle since World War II. So, some will say that it is time....while others will say - WHAT? We never really got out of it - have the past 7 yrs been bountiful? Has economic activity been strong on its own or has it been manufactured by the central bank intent on keeping up the illusion of a strong US economy?
"
1026,WFC,"We have competing commentary out of the FED, both Brainard and Tarullo reiterate their 'dovish stance' causing more inconsistency in 'the message'...all this while Fischer continues to tell the mkts that there is still a chance that rates 'rise' in 2015.......Can you say - 'dementia'?
"
1027,WFC,"OK...so next up? GS, C, NFLX, CSX, The day is young, you can feel the energy building...... As Marvin Gaye tells us: ""Let's get it on.....""
"
1028,WFC,"European mkts are a bit lower (nothing dramatic) on the back of the China data.....blah, blah, blah.......FTSE -0.60%, CAC 40 -0.40%, DAX 0.61%, EUROSTOXX -0.41%, SPAIN -0.54% AND ITALY -0.53%

"
1030,WFC,"Stocks finished the week with small gains, and while volume was lighter and interest felt like it was waning - the mkt did end the week at the best closing levels in over a month.
"
1031,WFC,"The strength that we saw last week is most likely attributable to traders/investors continued celebration of the latest release of the FOMC mins.....Those mins - released last week showed that Fed members remain concerned about global growth and the risk it poses to our economy...... (Never mind all the talk about how ready the US economy is for the normalization process to begin.) In the end - the bottom line is that there does not appear to be any rate hike on the calendar anytime soon. Over the weekend - Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, had this to say -
"
1032,WFC,"""Admittedly, there are still two employment reports scheduled for release before the FOMC meets in December......But at this stage we think it would take a major turnaround in payroll growth, to well above 200,000 per month, to persuade officials to support a December rate hike.""
"
1033,WFC,"And then on Sunday - While 'vacationing' at the IMF Policy meeting in Lima, Peru - Stanley Fischer had this to say to Reuters - who then ran with the following headline story.....
"
1034,WFC,"""Fed's Fischer says 2015 US rate rise is 'an expectation, not a commitment"" (Oh BOY!)...
"
1035,WFC,"In it he says that: ""US Federal Reserve policymakers are still likely to raise interest rates this year, BUT that is 'an expectation, not a commitment"" and could change if the global economy pushes the US economy further off course.....Both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to the federal funds rate target will depend critical on future developments in the economy....""
"
1036,WFC,"He went onto say that 'he felt the economy was still generating enough jobs to continue making progress towards the FED's goal of maximum employment and that inflation would eventually rise' - keeping the US central bank on track to raise rates this year.... and then he quickly protected himself by saying that ""the US is now more exposed than ever to international events and that developments in China and elsewhere had already influenced the FED to delay a widely expected rate increase in September"".
"
1037,WFC,"And this morning's WSJ has many of the IMF officials urging the FED to 'get on with it'....FED FATIGUE is now taking hold....all of the talk back and forth does nothing but cause more instability and anxiety in global mkts.....and so they all got together and said -Stop the madness - suggesting that they would prefer some sense of certainty vs. the 'agony of waiting'.....
"
1038,WFC,"""delaying the increase would not solve the situation....if it is a case that the emerging mkts have taken on too much debt, then there will a day of reckoning, Delaying an interest rate hike does not necessarily address that issue""
"
1039,WFC,"Now fatigue with the FED is like the fatigue that we all felt during the 2009 Presidential race, when Hillary announced 20 months prior to the election.....trying to work the crowd only to find that the crowd tired of all the back and forth....and what happened? She lost credibility, people grew exhausted of the Hillary show and started to re-focus their energies etc....and the world moved on.....so - is the world now tiring of the FED playing both sides of the fence? Feels like it is....
"
1040,WFC,"Now look - the rally seen over the last 9 sessions, has lifted the S&P (and all the major indexes) back above their 50 dma-, removing near term resistance. Does this mean that this rally will continue to take prices up? Sure, But not so fast.....There are daily calls for the 'coming recession'....analysts and strategists screaming about how the world is coming to an end (which could be just what we need to break out!) ......but could we be in the early stages of a bear market. - sure. Remember that part of the reality of bear markets is that they have strong 'short-covering' rallies the mkt tries to find fair value.....Take a look at the S&P......is a new and lower sideways channel building?
"
1041,WFC,"Notice the 8 month sideways channel that the S&P traded in before this summer. (2040/2130).....Now notice the break in August - taking us well outside of the lower band....only to bounce back to test the down trending 50 dma in mid-September. Then in late September, the S&P fell back down to test the August lows only to once again move up and test the down trending 50 dma - but this time - it moved up and thru it - seemingly breaking out.... - Well the next resistance is at 2045 (100 dma) and then 2060 (200 dma) - but if you look at the action - you can clearly see what looks like a new sideways channel developing right below the old sideways channel. (1850/2000). Now if this is true, then just maybe the mkt is in a short term overbought condition.....which means that we could see another down leg at anytime....Is that down leg now during earnings season? We are about to find out....
"
1042,WFC,"This week brings us a slew of macro data - Retail Sales - exp of 0.2%, ex autos and gas at 0.3%, PPI of -0.2%, ex food and energy of 0.1%.......In addition we get Empire state manufacturing of -8 and CPI of -0.2%,. ex food and energy of 0.1%. On the earnings front it is a BIG week.....JPM due out tomorrow after the bell, followed by BAC, WFC, C and GS later in the week. Throw in JNJ, INTC, BLK, CSX, and NFLX and it is sure to be an interesting week. Remember it is NOT so much about the actual earnings - they are history - it is about profit margins and future outlook. What role will China play in that outlook? Will China be the black swan?
"
1043,WFC,"This morning US futures are flat - It is Columbus Day here in the states, banks and the bond mkts are closed.....do not expect much action today as the investors await data later in the week.
"
1044,WFC,"That being said - look for more action in EMC.......This morning we did learn that all the chatter about DELL and EMC is true......Dell announces a plan to acquire EMC for $67 bil......The deal is worth about $33/sh ($24 in cash and $9 in VMWare) - which is 28% above Oct 7th closing price - when the rumors started......but clearly some people knew about this possibility at the end of September when the stock was trading at $23/share and started to break out for no reason..... Just sayin.......HELLO????

1048,WFC,"Stocks started out flat, but sold off throughout the session, ahead of earnings reports from Intel (INTC) and JPMorgan (JPM).The Nasdaq fell 0.9%, giving up its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 sagged 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.4%. Volume swelled across the board, according to preliminary data vs. Monday's light Columbus Day trade.Airlines, truckers and chipmakers led the downside in the stock market today, as JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and Skywest (SKYW) sank more than 7% each amid analyst downgrades. Managed care providers, automakers and alcoholic beverage stocks were among the biggest gainers.Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) rose 2% in big volume to move well above its 50-day moving average. The Belgian beer giant's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller is the biggest deal since 2013, when Verizon Communications (VZ) bought the rest of Verizon Wireless for $130 billion.Molson Coors (TAP) gapped up and surged 10% to a new high. The Coors Light brewer rose amid speculation it will buy the remaining stake in its MillerCoors joint venture with SABMiller, whose deal to buy SABMiller will likely face antitrust concerns.Tesla Motors (TSLA) ended a six-session skid as it staged an upward reversal to close up 2% in slightly faster trade after falling as much as 2% intraday. A major Southern California landlord plans to install energy systems powered by Tesla batteries at over a dozen office buildings to provide electricity during peak demand times, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times.After the close, Intel (INTC) was slightly higher after reporting Q3 earnings of 64 cents a share on $14.47 billion in revenue, topping views.In the IBD 50, 39 stocks fell and 11 rose.

"
1049,WFC,"The weak September jobs report had a silver lining for most stocks: The Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise interest rates this year. But for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C), it's just another storm cloud.Bank of America and other major banks have been counting on higher interest rates to widen the spread between their short-term borrowing costs and their long-term lending rates. Net interest margins have been squeezed in recent years, hurting core profitability.Citigroup analysts estimated that continued low interest rates would cut their 2016 earnings per share estimate for JPMorgan Chase by 5% in 2016 and 8% in 2017.The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.99% Friday after tumbling to 1.91% intraday. That's down from 2.3% on Sept. 16 — just before the Fed voted to leave rates near zero.Bank of America stock fell 1.1% on the stock market today, after dropping nearly 6% intraday. JPMorgan lost 1%. Citigroup was off just 1 cent while Wells Fargo 0.3%.Goldman Sachs (GS), which relies more on investment banking, rallied to close up 0.6%. But big regional lenders, like US Bancorp (USB) and Regions Financial (RF), lost 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rallied for 1.4% — 1.7% excluding financials.JPMorgan reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 13, with Wells Fargo the following day and other banks soon after that.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

"
1290,WFC,"The second round of the exams — the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — is more stringent than round one, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), because it examines banks' abilities to pay dividends, buy back shares and still serve borrowers during times of severe economic distress.
"
1291,WFC,"This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.

Last year's failure resulted in Citi's selling overseas branches as well as selling its consumer finance unit, OneMain Financial, for $4.25 billion.
"
1294,WFC,"This is the first year Citigroup will be able to boost its dividend since the financial crisis. Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach's jobs reportedly were on the line during this year's stress tests. Citi's passage comes as a big win for them.

"
1302,WFC,"Perhaps most under the microscope is Citigroup (C), which failed last year's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, an annual exam performed each year since 2009 to evaluate how banks would endure another financial crisis. The tests were written into the Dodd-Frank Act the following year.
"
1303,WFC,"The New York-based lender's chief executive officer, Michael Corbat, and two other senior executives are expected to face increasing pressure to resign if Citigroup fails the stress test for a second consecutive year.
"
1304,WFC,"Corbat, John Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer, and Brian Leach, Citigroup's head of financial risk and strategy, would face increasing calls from investors to resign and little sympathy from the Citigroup board of directors, according to a report from the Financial Times, citing two unnamed executives.
"
1305,WFC,"The first part of the test determines whether the company being tested has enough capital to endure nine quarters of difficult economic conditions. Part two of the test analyzes the companies' ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or make acquisitions during economic difficulties.

"
1314,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS) resubmitted its capital plan last year after failing to meet a minimum leverage ratio. As a result, the New York-based bank scaled back lines of business with low returns, reducing total assets as of June 30, 2014, by $56 billion to $860 billion.

"
1319,WFC,"Of the foreign banks to fall under the Fed's stress test, the U.S. units of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) and Spain's Banco Santander (SAN) are expected to fail as a result of weaknesses in their methods of predicting and measuring potential losses and risks, the Wall Street Journal reports.
"
1320,WFC,"If these banks fail the tests, their failure would mark the second consecutive year that large foreign banks stressed out on risk management grounds. Big foreign banks were drawn into the Fed's stress tests beginning last year.

KBW analysts remain optimistic that Wells Fargo — along with Morgan Stanley (MS) — will pass the stress test.Of the foreign banks to fall under the Fed's stress test, the U.S. units of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) and Spain's Banco Santander (SAN) are expected to fail as a result of weaknesses in their methods of predicting and measuring potential losses and risks, the Wall Street Journal reports.If these banks fail the tests, their failure would mark the second consecutive year that large foreign banks stressed out on risk management grounds. Big foreign banks were drawn into the Fed's stress tests beginning last year.Last week, the European Union's financial services commissioner, Jonathan Hill, said that U.S. capital requirements on foreign banks may be too onerous.

1371,WFC,"The boundary is down between work and home. How executives and businesses make the most of flex, virtual and temporary job approaches: Hustle. ""Technology has expanded the 9-to-5 workday into the 24/7 workday, which has made it extremely difficult for employees to have personal time.""So says Dan Schawbel, founder of WorkplaceTrends.com, a research and advisory service for HR professionals. In fact, 65% of employees report that managers expect them to be reachable outside the office by phone and/or email. That's according to a survey conducted by WorkplaceTrends.com and outplacement firm Career Arc. Bend. With work demands stretching into home time, almost half (45%) of employees feel they don't have enough hours to complete personal tasks. Some firms address that by offering flex programs that let staffers periodically work from home. Three-quarters of workers responding to the survey rank it as a top benefit vs. half of employers. ""In the future, every company will have a flexibility program, and those that don't will lose the battle for the top talent,"" Schawbel told IBD.The survey found almost 70% of employers tout work-from-home programs during recruitment, and 54% say those programs positively affect their ability to hire talent. Manage it. Telecommuters know shifting to home has its static. Nearly 70% of America's virtual employees say managers need to communicate more. That's according to a national Harris survey commissioned by leadership communication consultancy Interact. ""Leaders must be intentional and strategic about building a sense of connectedness with virtual workers to keep them engaged and ensure productivity and growth,"" said Lou Solomon, founder of Interact, which boosts communication skills. Speak up. More than half of respondents — 55% — say bosses keep in touch exclusively by email.That less personal route can lead to a disconnected feeling. ""People are wasting hours managing email that does nothing to build connections, much less trust,"" Solomon said. She suggests chatting via Skype and the phone. ""Consider 'No Email Fridays' and 'No Email Weekends' for virtual teams."" Think small. Avoid large, far-flung work groups.""Pare down the number of people on project teams to allow for intimacy and trust,"" Solomon said.Bring teams together twice a year for face-to-face meetings. ""Use this time to decide how the team wants to work and communicate with one another,"" she said. Go there. To keep in touch, Wells Fargo (WFC) Capital Finance CEO Henry Jordan sends a daily thought via video to his employees.Solomon recommends similar face time on a regular basis.""Hold in-person town hall meetings, allow people to ask questions and telecast them to the entire organization,"" she said. Break molds. Imtiaz Patel, managing partner of IQ Strategy Associates, tells professionals to think outside of organizational norms.His on-demand talent firm takes an Uber-esque approach to connecting companies with experienced, temporary professionals, including former CEOs. ""One of my friends works nine months a year. The rest of the time, he travels,"" Patel said. ""Another friend says he will never go back to the rigors of a rigid corporate lifestyle."" Make matches. Patel's short-term pros pitch-in at established and young firms. ""A large number of people who had permanent executive positions are telling us that they like their new lifestyles and want to keep them,"" Patel said.

1418,WFC,"""This is a great country and a greater people,"" exclaimed Henry Wells upon visiting California during the Gold Rush era.Wells (1805-78) believed passionately in America. Where others saw pitfalls in the expanding country, he saw limitless opportunity.Wells, who played a critical role in launching American Express (AXP) on the East Coast and Wells Fargo (WFC) on the West, was the classic American entrepreneur.He combined foresight with hard work as he helped pioneer America's first wide-scale delivery and banking services, then shared his wealth through innovative philanthropy.New EnglanderBorn in Vermont, Wells, after a spell as a farmer and shoemaker, became acquainted with the transportation industry on the East Coast through his work as a freight agent on the Erie Canal.That proved formative in opening his eyes to the lucrative opportunities for delivering mail, money, valuables and goods to Americans.Blessed with a relentless work ethic, Wells became indispensable during the infancy of the delivery service industry in the 1840s.He was famous for making tricky and improbable deliveries, such as bringing fresh oysters to Buffalo restaurants.Thanks to his familiarity with the railroads and shipping, he also had a knack for identifying the quickest route to deliver a package, often reducing shipment time by weeks.In 1850, he spearheaded the formation of American Express.He impressed upon his employees the importance of speed and loyal service. Knowing that his customers depended on his reliability, Wells didn't let anything stop him, not even dangerous weather.He would risk storms on the Great Lakes to make sure that his customers received their packages.As he explained to his team, ""It was the duty of the express to go,"" and ""You are expected to get there, that is all.""The sluggish federal government had trouble competing with an efficient businessman like Wells.The public prized his express delivery, which was cheaper and faster than the U.S. postal system's. Such was the success of Wells that the post office, reeling from public disfavor, had to reduce its rates.Wells endured government harassment via regulations, which he shook off easily, calling himself the ""people's postmaster."" He considered his express delivery a ""peaceful revolution."" His philosophy was that the ""government should do as little as possible"" in those areas of life where the private sector could supply service.Solid ExecutionAs head of American Express for almost 20 years, Wells enjoyed the respect of America's executive class. Businessmen marveled at the steadiness of his firm's delivery.As means of shipment went, said one businessman, ""none equaled Wells' trunk!""Wells was also renowned for his eye for innovation, appreciating long before other businessmen the value of inventions such as the telegraph. He is credited with starting some of the first telegraph lines on the East Coast.Wells became a business star despite suffering from a stutter.""He worked around it,"" Robert Chandler, author of ""Wells Fargo,"" told IBD. ""He did not let it define him, and he could use it for emphasis and advantage when he wished. He took a liability and turned it into a positive.""Walk The TalkWells set up a string of speech therapy centers. Friends would often note, said Chandler, that ""he cured everyone but himself.""Other people, suffering from such a problem, might have withdrawn from life. Wells plunged into it. He was a gregarious risk-taker who saw in the expansion of the country and the discovery of gold in California in the mid-1800s a chance to do on the West Coast what he had done on the East.Staid colleagues at American Express pooh-poohed his plans for expansion across the country, but he disregarded the carping. ""Westward, ever westward,"" he said.Teaming up with railroad freight agent William Fargo, Wells founded Wells, Fargo & Co. in 1852. They established its headquarters in San Francisco.Wells saw that the gold miners and the businesses that served them would need banking and mail-delivery services.As California and the other Western states grew, the demand for Wells' offerings expanded too.The miners came to rely on his fabled stagecoach network, which spanned thousands of miles, for the delivery of everything from their gold to their wives and children.Do It RightAlong the way, Wells popularized the philosophy that the customer comes first. That legacy of sound conduct is still prized at his firm, according to Wells Fargo spokesman Matthew Wadley.Wells told his associates: ""There was one very powerful business rule. It was concentrated in the word 'courtesy.'""Take advantage of no one, he told his employees.""He didn't stand for any foolishness from his employees,"" said Chandler. ""The slime balls failed.""Indeed, Wells made sure everyone in the firm from the lowliest clerk to members of the board of directors adhered to high standards.""Because of Wells, the company had ethical directors, observant directors,"" according to Chandler.Wells Fargo instructed its employees: ""The most polite and gentlemanly treatment of all customers, however insignificant in their business, is insisted upon. Proper respect must be shown to all — let them be men, women or children, rich or poor, white or black — it must not be forgotten that the company is dependent on these same people for its business.""Wells approached his business with unusual care for an executive of that era, as was evident in his willingness to take the dangerous, months-long trip from New York to California to inspect his offices and employees personally in 1852.He found the frenetic economic activity of Gold Rush California invigorating and wasn't above laughing at himself. ""I am an old fogy here,"" he said, though he was only in his 40s.Wells' insistence on sound business practices and refusal to cut corners served the company well in times of panic, of which that wild frontier period had many.During a banking collapse in the 1850s, people sought refuge in Wells Fargo, as it was the only bank that made sure to keep enough funds on hand for such occasions.Almost anybody could open a bank at that time, but Wells Fargo, owing to its dependability, cleared the field easily.In the 1860s, Wells turned his attention increasingly to philanthropy. He had no intention of dying rich. He was eager to give his money away to worthy causes.Chief among them was education. Wells called the founding of a college the ""dream of my life.""In 1868, the dream came true when he opened the doors for Wells College in Aurora, N.Y.It was one of America's first colleges for women. Some of his peers considered an institution of higher learning for women a frivolous act of charity. Wells didn't care.""Give her the opportunity,"" he told his critics.Sharing The WealthBy the time of his death just shy of age 73, Wells had given much of his money away. Even so, he left an estate of $400,000 — worth almost $10 million today.Due to his stammer, he couldn't give the Founder's Day address at Wells College in 1875, but he could write it. He used it to sum up his life:""Our lives are not measured by the number of years and days we exist, but by what we accomplish while we live, and the good we may render to our fellow men.""

1432,WFC,"Stocks on Monday failed to hold onto the early gains — as worries over the macro data, dollar strength and earnings once again weighed on traders' minds. All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?

1433,WFC,"Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials. Rising legal and regulatory expenses, slowing mortgage lending, a decrease in trading revenues, a collapsing energy space all will play into the mix… YTD - though, financials have underperformed the broader mkt.....down about 2% for the group....followed only by energy and utilities.......
"
1434,WFC,"But like we said — earnings represent history — what is important is what the future looks like….and recently the Credit Managers Index (CMI) has reported an increase in rejected credit applications — this spike coming only in the last month — too late for any real impact on 1st qtr earnings but a clear indicator of what may be in store. With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.

1436,WFC,"Last night after the bell - we heard from Norfolk Southern (NSC) - in pre-release commentary - they prepared investors for a disappointment - not because of the dollar ..Oh No....it was because of 'lower fuel SURCHARGE revenue'.....(and lower coal shipments).....but isn't this just a kick in the pants? Oil declines in price bringing untold benefits to transportation companies along with a host of others and now Norfolk Southern tells us that earnings could be down 15% because they CAN'T charge higher fuel surcharges?

1437,WFC,"(A surcharge is an ADD'L charge or payment on top of a regular cost.....so if investors are buying Norfolk - because they are able to increase revenues by increasing surcharges - then someone should think about a new portfolio manager......Surcharges do not represent organic growth, or an improved outlook - they only represent the ability of companies to fleece their clients with add'l fees etc......

1476,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC) agreed to sell $8.5 billion of its federally guaranteed student loans to Sallie Mae spinoff Navient (NAVI), extricating itself from that type of lending as it focuses on private lending to students, which is significant.

1485,WFC,"Rising interest rates and better market and lending conditions bode well for the U.S. banking sector in 2015, though regulatory and legal headwinds will persist, said financial services specialist Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a banking outlook report on Thursday.Along with higher short-term interest rates, KBW expects market volatility to boost trading activity at large U.S. ""universal banks,"" those viewed as globally important.But KBW rates only two names of eight as outperformers for 2015 in the universal-bank group: Goldman Sachs (GS) and State Street (STT).KBW thinks benefits are already reflected in earnings and valuations in most of the universal-bank group, which includes some of the largest banks, such as JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC). It sees upward earnings revisions as the main drivers of stock performance next year.As for large regional banks, KBW likes names that can grow net interest income regardless of the Fed's action on interest rates. It cites two in particular — Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), based in Columbus, Ohio; and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI).In the small to midcap group, it'll come down to the ""direction of estimates,"" KBW said. Despite its so-so view on the group itself, KBW has several ""favorite plays"" for 2015.They include Signature Bank (SBNY), Private Bancorp (PVTB), Eagle Bancorp (EGBN), Talmer Bancorp (TLMR), First Merchants Corp. (FRME) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL). Those stocks are also rated highly by IBD, with Composite Ratings of 90 or above out of a possible 99. Composite Ratings factor in earnings growth, stock price gains and other metrics.KBW, a subsidiary of Stifel Financial (SF), is a boutique investment bank and broker-dealer.

1566,WFC,"""I think they're going to be fine because they've had a full year to go back and address the things the Fed was concerned with,"" said Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""Getting approved for $7 billion (in investor paybacks) would be good news.""
"
1567,WFC,"Bank of America (BAC) passed Round 1, but memories remain of its bungled CCAR submission last year that led the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender to abandon a 5-cent dividend payout. As a result, the Fed could be tougher on it in terms of analyzing its payouts.

"
1569,WFC,"Goldman Sachs (GS) underwhelmed at the DFAST level by posting a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.1%, compared to the 8% minimum, but its 6.3% Tier 1 common capital ratio, which gauges high-quality capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, bested the 5% minimum.
"
1570,WFC,"After last year's exams, the New York-based bank responded by cutting its total assets by $55 billion from a year earlier to $856 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.

"
1572,WFC,"Morgan Stanley (MS) reached a $2.6 billion residential mortgage-backed securities settlement with the Department of Justice last month and the deal wiped out about half a year's worth of earnings. That could result in the Fed demanding more conservative capital plans, Harte noted.

1575,WFC,"""Over the next couple of years, we're going to be looking at massively overcapitalized banks under any scenario unless they're allowed to return more capital to shareholders,"" Harte said.Now the real stress begins. Round 2 results of the Federal Reserve's stress tests for banks are scheduled for release Wednesday, and some big banks that passed last week could find themselves getting the stink eye from regulators this week.The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) tests the nation's 31 largest banks, including seven foreign-owned lenders, on their plans to return capital to investors via dividend payouts, share buybacks and major acquisitions or sales in the event of a severe recession.It's regulators' most high-profile method of keeping banks in check after the financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts that ensued.Overall, Barclays analysts wrote in a research note that they expect payout ratios to increase to 79% this year compared with 65% in last year's CCAR. Dividend payouts should be below historical averages (28% vs. 41%) while share repurchases should be above the historic norms (53% vs. 39%), Barclays analysts said.""We ... look for most (banks) to continue or increase their share repurchase activity (this year),"" Barclays noted.Last week, all 31 banks passed the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST), which showed they all met minimum capital ratio requirements in the hypothetical situation that the unemployment rate hits 10%, stocks plunge and the housing market declines 25%.But passing Round 1 — even with flying colors — does not mean getting through Round 2 is assured. Last year, Citigroup (C) passed the first round, only to stumble when the Fed rejected its investor payout plan, citing its concern with the New York-based bank's ability to foresee losses in ""material parts of its global operations.""Since that time, Citi has sold off its OneMain Financial unit for personal loans to Springleaf Holdings (LEAF) for $4.25 billion in cash. It also said it will pull its retail banking business out of 11 markets — mostly in Central and South America — as well as leave the consumer banking markets of Japan, Egypt, the Czech Republic and elsewhere.With CEO Michael Corbat and CFO John Gerspach's jobs reportedly on the line, at least one analyst thinks Citi's senior management will lean on the side of conservatism when it comes to putting forth its capital return plan.""I think they're going to be fine because they've had a full year to go back and address the things the Fed was concerned with,"" said Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.

1576,WFC,"The law of large numbers doesn't seem to apply to global card processing giant Visa — the principle being that big companies that have been around a long time can't maintain growth and stock price appreciation forever.
"
1577,WFC,"Visa (V) stock has gained 21% since the end of 2013, the best performer on the Dow. (On Thursday, Visa began trading on a 4-for-1 stock split-adjusted basis.) Earnings have consistently climbed by double-digit percentages.
"
1578,WFC,"""In network land, being big is a huge asset,"" said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Credit Suisse. ""Being everywhere is part of what makes a network successful. You're talking about a very large market, and Visa has the dominant market share.""

1580,WFC,"Mid-Century Modernizer
"
1581,WFC,"Visa traces its roots to 1958, when Bank of America (BAC) launched the first consumer credit card program to middle-class consumers and small-to-midsize merchants in the U.S. Visa-branded cards appeared in the 1970s, around when the VisaNet electronic payments system launched worldwide.
"
1582,WFC,"After a restructuring in 2007, Visa went public in March 2008, one of the largest and most successful IPOs at the time. Visa's Western European operation wasn't part of it. Visa Europe is a separate company owned by member banks. If Visa ever reaches a deal with the banks to acquire Visa Europe, as it would like, it ""could be a kicker down the road,"" Orenbuch said.
"
1583,WFC,"Scale has big advantages as Visa keeps adding new customers to its network in the worldwide shift from cash and checks to electronic payments. Top rival MasterCard (MA) benefits from that secular trend too.
"
1584,WFC,"""Both have good margins,"" said Orenbuch, ""but Visa's is even larger than MasterCard's because of its large size — its scale.""
"
1585,WFC,"In its fiscal 2015 first quarter, ended in December, VisaNet processed 17.6 billion transactions, up 10% year over year. Payment volume hit $1.2 trillion, up 11%.
"
1586,WFC,"Earnings per share rose 15% to $2.53. Despite a Q2 that will come up against an unusual tax benefit from the same quarter a year ago, full-year earnings are seen growing 14%, according to Thomson Reuters' poll of analysts. The biggest gains are expected in Q3 and Q4.
"
1587,WFC,"Visa has no debt and has been active in share buybacks, 3.1 million shares in the December quarter, plus 2.5 million through Jan. 27.
"
1588,WFC,"In the U.S., Visa also has benefited from its ""better partnerships"" with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC), especially during bank consolidations that occurred several years ago, Orenbuch says.
"
1589,WFC,"For example, Visa snagged Washington Mutual's card business after the bank's assets were acquired by JPMorgan Chase in 2008. JPMorgan has since formed a more exclusive relationship with Visa.

"
1600,WFC,"""Secular growth of electronic payments is powering through relatively soft global economic conditions,"" he told IBD. ""Eighty-five percent of global transactions are still cash and checks, so there is still this massive opportunity to convert cash to electronic payments.""

1603,WFC,"Not to be left behind by the tech revolution, Visa has invested heavily in digital payments, such as Visa Checkout (formerly V.Me).

1604,WFC,"Visa Checkout makes it easier for consumers to pay with cards online on any device and continues to expand to new markets. Visa says that will be in 16 markets this year.
"
1605,WFC,"Visa will also likely get a boost from price hikes. With October's Q4 fiscal 2014 earnings, Visa said it would raise prices on certain fees to U.S. card acquirers starting this April, the first such pricing action in four years. Shares shot up 10%.
"
1606,WFC,"MasterCard hiked fees in 2013, but Visa didn't follow. William Blair analysts estimate that Visa's new pricing action will add 2-3 percentage points to revenue growth. Visa has said the price hike would contribute to stepped-up revenue growth in this year's second half.

1623,WFC,"How do you follow a legend?
"
1624,WFC,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
1625,WFC,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
1626,WFC,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
1627,WFC,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
1628,WFC,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
1629,WFC,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
1630,WFC,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
1631,WFC,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
1632,WFC,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
1633,WFC,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
1634,WFC,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
1635,WFC,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
1636,WFC,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
1637,WFC,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
1638,WFC,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
1639,WFC,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
1640,WFC,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
1641,WFC,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
1642,WFC,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
1643,WFC,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
1644,WFC,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
1645,WFC,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
1646,WFC,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
1647,WFC,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
1648,WFC,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
1649,WFC,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
1650,WFC,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
1651,WFC,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
1652,WFC,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
1653,WFC,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
1654,WFC,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
1655,WFC,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
1656,WFC,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
1657,WFC,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.

1658,WFC,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
1659,WFC,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
1660,WFC,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
1661,WFC,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
1662,WFC,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
1663,WFC,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
1664,WFC,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
1665,WFC,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
1666,WFC,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
1667,WFC,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
1668,WFC,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
1669,WFC,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
1670,WFC,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1671,WFC,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
1672,WFC,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
1673,WFC,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
1674,WFC,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
1675,WFC,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
1676,WFC,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
1677,WFC,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
1678,WFC,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
1679,WFC,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
1680,WFC,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
1681,WFC,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
1682,WFC,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
1683,WFC,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
1684,WFC,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
1685,WFC,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
1686,WFC,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
1687,WFC,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.IBD: What's your biggest bet?Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner.

1705,WFC,"The U.S. economy is officially growing at a relatively fast clip, but the country's biggest banks are not. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C)and Bank of America (BAC) reported dismal quarterly results on Wednesday and Thursday, and all four took it hard on the chin in the stock market. Citigroup has fallen more than 9% in five sessions.…
"
1706,WFC,"Higher legal costs, ballooning credit-loss provisions and sagging trading revenue tarnished JPMorgan Chase 's (JPM) disappointing fourth quarter results as the nation's biggest bank kicked off the annual corporate performance reporting season.The New York-based lender's Q4 earnings fell 8.5% from a year earlier to $1.19 a share, missing by 12 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 2.3% to $21.4 billion, missing views of $21.2 billion.No stranger to the courts, JPMorgan has been targeted by government regulators and plaintiffs' lawyers alike. In Q4, it posted a $1.1 billion charge before taxes for legal expenses. It was one of several big banks that paid a total of $4.3 billion to regulators in the U.S., Switzerland and the United Kingdom for allegedly rigging foreign exchange currency markets.Provisions for credit losses — money set aside to cover bad loans — swelled to $804 million from $104 million in Q4 2013.The bank's total assets rose 7% for the year to $2.6 trillion at Dec. 31.Of those assets, total loans grew 3% to $757.3 billion. Credit card loans rose 3% to $131 billion. Core loans rose 8% year over year, while the bank's net interest margin slipped five basis points to 2.14%. Net income for consumer and community banking fell 11% to $2.2 billion.Fixed-income markets revenue dropped 23% from the prior year to $2.5 billion, driven by JPMorgan's sale of its commodities unit as well as lower revenue in its securitized product and credit-related products.Return on equity dropped to 9% in Q4 from 10% in Q4 2013, while return on assets slid to 0.78% from 0.87% a year earlier.Shares fell 4.4% in morning tradng and remained depressed by early afternoon at about 56.15 in the stock market today (Wednesday). JPMorgan, whose stock gained 7% last year, has seen its shares drop 10% this year and fall below the company's 200-day moving average. JPMorgan currently has an IBD Composite Rating of 44, which means that 56% of other publicly traded companies' stock outperform it.Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported Q4 earnings today, largely meeting Wall Street expectations.

Volume was mixed, dipping about 1% on the NYSE and rising 4% on the Nasdaq compared to Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Makers of consumer telecommunications stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today. Motorola Solutions (MSI), which makes two-way radios and other communications products, plunged more than 8% despite better-than-expected Q3 profit and sales results. The stock, which had been working on a flat base, crashed through its 50-day moving average before finally steadying just above its 200-day line.Tesla Motors (TSLA) led shares of automakers higher, soaring 11% as the electric vehicle maker's Q4 delivery outlook trumped a weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The stock is testing resistance at its 200-day line but remains 19% off its 52-week higher.HomeAway (AWAY) rocketed in post-session trading after Expedia (EXPE) agreed to buy the online marketplace for vacation rentals for $3.9 billion. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year pending regulatory approval, is expected to help Expedia compete against home-rental businesses such as Airbnb.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) rose in after-hours trading following its Q3 earnings report. Profit for the period rose 33% to 57 cents a share on a 41% gain in revenue to $4.5 billion. Both topped Wall Street estimates.The company said the number of daily active users rose 17% from a year ago to 1.01 billion on average for September. Mobile daily active users jumped 27% to 894 million on average during the month.Facebook rose 1% during the regular session. It's out of buying range from a 96.59 buy point.Qualcomm (QCOM) was down sharply after hours after its outlook for the fiscal first quarter that ends in December trailed analysts' estimates. That outweighed better-than-expected results in the latest period.Disney (DIS), Celgene (CELG), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Nvidia (NVDA) are among companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings Thursday.Economic reports due Thursday include initial jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 31 and Q3 productivity data.

1731,WFC,"SolarCity (SCTY) announced on Wednesday a $350 million deal with investment bank JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to finance more rooftop solar projects, sending the No. 1 U.S. residential installer's stock up.The San Mateo, Calif.-based SolarCity had previously signed a deal with JPMorgan Chase to finance about $170 million in residential solar projects in 2013.SolarCity stock was near 50, up 2% in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock is down 44% from its all-time high of 88.35, set on Feb. 26. Solar stocks have fallen lately in tandem with plummeting crude oil prices.For the current quarter, SolarCity expects an adjusted loss of $1.25 to $1.35 a share, compared with an adjusted loss of 46 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The company guided revenue of $67 million to $76 million, up 42% to 61%.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a loss minus items of $1.27 per share on revenue of $71.75 million.In December, SolarCity announced a partnership with Bank of America (BAC) to finance $400 million in solar power projects in 2015.SolarCity has rolled out several other initiatives in recent months, including a deal with Wal-Mart (WMT) in November to build solar facilities and an effort to sell solar bonds online to investors. SolarCity will install solar projects at Wal-Mart facilities in up to 36 states over the next four years, and it will test energy-storage projects at nearly two dozen facilities.SolarCity in October began selling ""solar bonds"" online to investors through its online investment site solarbonds.solarcity.com. The various bonds mature at one year, two years, three years and seven years, and carry interest rates from 2% to 4%.SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive told IBD at the time that the bonds are aimed at all U.S. investors at least 18 years old who want to invest as little as $1,000. There are no fees to purchase the bonds, and potential buyers can open accounts on the SolarCity site. Wells Fargo (WFC) is partnering on the banking side.SolarCity, which went public in 2012, has also expanded through a series of acquisitions, including solar-cell manufacturer Silevo.SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Lyndon Rive and his brother, Peter Rive (currently chief technology officer). Their cousin, Elon Musk, is chairman. Musk also is CEO of Tesla Motors (TSLA).Rival Vivint Solar (VSLR), the No. 2 U.S. residential installer, plans to open 20 sales and operations offices in January.

1732,WFC,"A few years ago, you'd have been hard pressed to think of a more vulnerable business than a Phoenix-based holding company for banks in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California.
"
1733,WFC,"All of those markets got pounded by the triple whammy of the housing bubble, financial crisis and Great Recession. Banks were particularly vulnerable. Those that weren't overwhelmed by bad debt were hit by dwindling loan opportunities from business clients that were too spooked to finance expansion.
"
1734,WFC,"Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) was on the front lines of all this misery.
"
1735,WFC,"The company provides business banking and other financial services through its primary subsidiary, Western Alliance Bank. It is also the holding company for numerous other banks, including the Alliance Bank of Arizona, the Las Vegas-based Bank of Nevada and the San Diego-based Torrey Pines Bank.
"
1736,WFC,"Much of Western Alliance's business comes from commercial real estate, land development and industrial loans.
"
1737,WFC,"Bubble Trouble
"
1738,WFC,"Although residential loans make up only a small part of its portfolio, the company still got hit hard after the housing bubble burst.
"
1739,WFC,"It logged a big drop in profits in 2008 and then lost money in both 2009 and 2010. Its share price, which peaked at 39.10 in July 2006, bottomed out at 2.99 three and a half years later.
"
1740,WFC,"Unlike some banks, however, Western Alliance quickly righted its ship. It moved back into the black in 2011 and now enjoys robust earnings growth and a share price that has been trading near multiyear highs this month.
"
1741,WFC,"The company's rebound has been driven by a decline in its bad debt and a rise in loans amid an economic recovery in key markets.
"
1742,WFC,"""Helped by the strengthening recovery in the local Arizona and Nevada economies, Western Alliance is through the worst on credit and should continue to show steady improvement in its portfolio trends,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joe Morford noted in a recent report.
"
1743,WFC,"Those trends include an ongoing improvement in the quality of Western Alliance's loans. At the end of 2013, it had $77.2 million in total nonperforming loans. That was down from $106.1 million the previous year and $159.2 million in 2009. Nonperforming loans are those where the debtor has not made a scheduled payment for at least 90 days.
"
1744,WFC,"Net charge-offs — debt that is unlikely to be repaid — totaled $8.6 million at the end of 2013, down from $50.6 million in 2012 and $115.3 million in 2009.
"
1745,WFC,"Those numbers continue to improve this year. Morford estimates that Western Alliance's nonperforming loans will fall to $73.2 million at the end of 2014. He sees net charge-offs reversing into net recoveries of $5.1 million at the end of the year — a sign that Western Alliance has been able to recover some of the debt it previously thought would never be paid.
"
1746,WFC,"Meanwhile, Western Alliance's top line has gotten a boost from a much better lending environment, driven by economic growth in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California.
"
1747,WFC,"During its third quarter, the company reported total loans of $7.93 billion, up from $6.52 billion a year earlier. Net interest income rose 16% year-over-year to $98.1 million. Total deposits climbed 19% to $8.70 billion.
"
1748,WFC,"Western Alliance officials did not return phone calls seeking comment for this article. In a statement following the company's third-quarter report, CEO Robert Sarver said, ""(Our) balance-sheet momentum continued with double-digit growth rates in loans and deposits.""
"
1749,WFC,"In addition, he said, the company maintained ""a tight focus on expense control as operating costs were flat from the second quarter. Asset quality remains strong as we have experienced net recoveries in four of the last five quarters.""
"
1750,WFC,"Western Alliance reported Q3 earnings of 46 cents a share, up 44% from the prior year and 6 cents above consensus analyst views. Its stock price touched a more than seven-year high of 27.97 on Dec. 9.
"
1751,WFC,"The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 and ranks No. 1 in IBD's Banks-West/Southwest group. Other leading stocks in the group include Preferred Bank (PFBC) and Bank of Marin Bancorp (BMRC).
"
1752,WFC,"Western Alliance operates five different operating segments: Arizona, Nevada, California, Central Business Lines (CBL) and Corporate & Other.
"
1753,WFC,"Its CBL segment, which provides banking services to niche markets, has shown particular strength of late. Gary Tenner, analyst at D.A. Davidson, notes that Western Alliance's average annualized loan growth was 26% during the third quarter. In contrast, the CBL segment recorded 72% growth.
"
1754,WFC,"Robust loan growth gives Western Alliance an ability ""to be judicious on pricing and credit risk while diversifying geographic exposure,"" Tenner said. ""Management suggested a strong focus on deposit gathering to fund loan growth in 2015.""
"
1755,WFC,"Rising Confidence
"
1756,WFC,"Part of that growth will be driven by improving macro conditions.
"
1757,WFC,"""Not only are the local economies in Phoenix and Southern California still relatively healthy, but business owner confidence is improving as well,"" RBC's Morford noted.
"
1758,WFC,"Western Alliance also has room to pick up market share from competitors, he said. In Arizona, three megabanks dominate the banking market: Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).
"
1759,WFC,"""Even just in its home state of Arizona, Western Alliance still has a significant opportunity to grow, particularly when its three big bank competitors control over 70% of the market and it still has only a 3% share,"" Morford noted.
"
1760,WFC,"Buyouts might play a role in Western Alliance's market share grab. On a Q3 conference call with analysts on October 17, CEO Sarver said that the company ""has been involved in discussions with over 20 companies over the last 12 months."" At the time, he said that a deal was likely within six months.

1771,WFC,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

Citibank (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) were both up fractionally, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) eased less than 1%.The UBS upgrade of BofA was the second one for the Charlotte, N.C., lender in one month. On Sept. 8, Goldman Sachs also raised BofA to buy from neutral.Goldman noted in a report that BofA has shifted out of businesses such as mortgages and trading, and into more profitable ones such as wealth and asset management.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .

1918,WFC,"Earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with a slew of high-profile quarterly results from some of the biggest and brightest companies. Many are the first to report for their given industry, giving investors a particular interest in analyzing the financials and outlooks.Here are six of the most important earnings reports on tap.TuesdayCharles Schwab (SCHW) was a pioneering discount brokerage, but it's still blazing new trails. Schwab shares hit a 13-year high on March 21. The stock consolidated and attempted a breakout on July 3. It fell back as the market sold off, though in light volume. Schwab rose 0.7% to 27.10 on the stock market Friday.Wall Street expects Schwab to report a 28% earnings per share gain to 23 cents. That would snap 3 quarters of accelerating growth.J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) has had a tough time of late. Once deemed the best-run Wall Street bank, JPMorgan Chase has paid billions of dollars in various settlements. Mortgage activity has slowed — affecting many lenders — while fixed-income trading seems permanently depressed. JPMorgan said in a SEC filing that it expected Q2 market revenues down 20% vs. a year earlier. Finally, the company reported on July 1 that CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer, though that should be ""curable.""Shares have retreated since hitting a 14-year high in late March.JPMorgan earnings likely fell 19% to $1.29 a share, matching Q1's 19% year-over-year decline. JPMorgan is just one of several major bank earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported earnings Friday. Citigroup (C) reports Monday, with Goldman Sachs (GS) joining JPMorgan on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC) results are due Wednesday.Intel (INTC) has seen a rebirth in recent months, with shares recently hitting a 10-year high, in the wake of solid Q1 results in early April and then upwardly revised revenue guidance on June 12. Intel is benefitting from the recent revival in corporate PC sales after Microsoft (MSFT) stopped supporting the venerable Windows operating system.Intel earnings should show a 33% gain to 52 cents a share, following yearly changes of -5%, 6%, 0%, -28% in the prior four quarters. Investors will want to have some indication if PC sales will remain strong in the second half of the year, or if Intel will find some other way to expand.Yahoo (YHOO) earnings will rise 9% to 38 cents a share, following Q1's flat reading. Q1 revenue edged higher, as display ad sales climbed 2%, offering some hope that CEO Marissa Mayer can generate top-line growth. Still, Yahoo's most important news may be about Alibaba. Yahoo owns a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant, and it gives some headline figures on Alibaba's results.Alibaba's planned U.S. IPO is widely expected to take place in August. Yahoo will sell a significant share of its existing holdings as part of the offering.Yahoo shares have been in a downtrend since hitting a decade-best in early January.WednesdayLas Vegas Sands (LVS) is the world's largest casino operator. Despite its name, Sands — like Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) — gets the bulk of its revenue and profit from Macau, China's gaming enclave and the world's largest gambling site. Macau growth has slowed in recent months amid a crackdown on moneylenders in the area. But there are some signs that the worst is over for Macau. Meanwhile, Las Vegas casino revenue has been solid.Las Vegas Sands earnings should show a 40% gain to 91 cents a share, analysts predicted. That would the second straight quarter of moderate acceleration.But Sands stock has been in a modest downtrend for the past four months, falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages last week.ThursdayGoogle (GOOGL) is involved in many ventures, from self-driving cars to alternative-energy investments to Android mobile software. The open-source Android has become the global leader over Apple (AAPL) iOS. It's a direct money-maker, though it likely does help boost mobile ad revenue. Search-based ads remain the bulk of Google's business. But it's a good business: Earnings likely rose 31% to $6.26 a share. That would follow decelerating growth for the past two quarters to just 8% in Q1.Google shares hit a record high of 615.05 in late February. The stock consolidated and has been building a handle on its cup base. Google (GOOG) Class C shares, which started trading on April 3, are near a new highFollow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.RELATED:Wells Fargo Q2 Earnings Growth Slows As Banks Report

2052,WFC,"It's finally spring, but wintry weather is likely to dominate the upcoming earnings season.
"
2053,WFC,"S&P 500 earnings will grow just 1.2% vs. a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That would be the 10th straight quarter of single-digit growth and the slowest pace since Q3 2012. Revenue is expected to grow a slothlike 2.7% for the first three months of 2014.About two-thirds of companies typically top forecasts, so the final figures will likely be less grim — but still well below Q4's 9.9%.""Nobody is expecting any fireworks,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research.Companies have been quick to blame bad weather in lowering expectations. There have been about six negative preannouncements for every positive one, Thomson Reuters said.Consumer discretionary firms are expected to deliver 6.1% earnings growth, down from 14.5% projected at the start of 2014.""That's one of the sectors that is really talking about the weather a lot,"" said Gregory Harrison, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters. ""People are staying home, not going out shopping.""FedEx (FDX) missed estimates last month when it reported its fiscal Q3 ended Feb. 28, saying that unusually severe winter weather ""disrupted operations, decreased shipping volume and impacted year-over-year operating income by an estimated $125 million.""Not surprisingly, utilities are expected to benefit from the bad weather, with earnings seen up 7.7% and revenue 3.9%. It is the sole S&P 500 sector that wasn't revised downward for Q1, Harrison said.Telecom is the sector expected to show the best growth at 12.8%.Technology should report a tepid 2.5% gain. Apple (AAPL) should eke out EPS growth of less than 1%, while Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) show declines. But Facebook (FB), added to the S&P 500 in December, should double EPS.Energy and materials sectors should report earnings declines, reflecting sluggish global demand, particularly in China and emerging markets.Financial earnings should drop 2.6% with revenue off 0.8%. Banks are about finished with profit-flattering loan-loss reserve releases. Many are laying off mortgage staff and selling off their commodities units.Multibillion-dollar legal settlements involving big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) haven't helped their bottom lines either. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (WFC) will report Q1 results on April 11.Bank Of America (BAC) EPS likely fell 75% in Q1. The Charlotte, N.C.-based giant reports April 16.""The biggest industry within the finance sector — banks — they don't really have much growth avenues right now,"" said Mian of Zacks Investment Research.Property and casual insurers are expected to take a beating — a 12% decline — likely due to inclement weather.Struggles in emerging markets such as Turkey and the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine certainly have weighed on investors, but haven't made a big impact on earnings, Mian said.""If Russia had gotten out of hand or gets out of hand going forward and comes in the way of the emerging recovery in Europe, then it's potentially a problem for earnings,"" he said.Investors will be particularly interested in companies' guidance for evidence that earnings growth will heat up in the spring.Wall Street sees 8.5% earnings growth in Q2. Revenue should rise 3.7%, just so-so, but it would be the best in two years.

2055,WFC,"The Blackstone Group, the largest U.S. landlord of single-family homes, is working with Deutsche Bank to sell $1 billion of securities tied to its properties — about twice the size of previous offerings, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.
"
2056,WFC,"Deutsche Bank (DB) may start marketing the debt to investors within a month, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the transaction is private. The offering would be the fourth of rental-home bonds, following American Homes 4 Rent's (AMH) $482.7 million bond deal this month, Colony American Homes' (CAHS) sale of $513.6 million of the debt in April and Blackstone 's (BX) $479 million issue in October.Blackstone has spent $8.5 billion on almost 44,000 houses around the country through its Invitation Homes division, leading hedge funds, private-equity firms and real estate investment trusts seeking to profit from rising demand for rentals. The largest investors have raised about $20 billion to purchase as many as 200,000 properties in the past two years after prices nationally plunged as much as 35% from the 2006 peak.Securitization is an attractive source of financing because it gives landlords the opportunity to free up capital and provides borrowed money that's more stable than credit lines, according to Jade Rahmani, a New York-based analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.'Additional Acquisitions'""The proceeds for some of the issuers will be used to fund additional acquisitions as those companies continue to scale their platforms and grow in a targeted way,"" he said. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment on the transaction, as did Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams.Corporate landlords are looking to the debt market for capital to buy more houses and increase returns by adding leverage to the properties they purchased with cash. An affiliate of Agoura Hills, California-based American Homes 4 Rent, the second-largest rental-home owner, with 26,000 properties, plans to sell bonds backed by 3,871 of its rental properties in states including Florida and Texas, with an offering beginning this week. Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are underwriting the deal.""One differentiating thing about that deal is that it's in unique regions,"" said Brian Grow, a managing director of residential mortgage-backed securities at Morningstar. ""The American Homes 4 Rent properties are in regions that were less volatile during the crisis than the other two deals.""Securities SoldColony American Homes, the third-largest single-family landlord in the U.S., with 15,600 homes, last month sold securities linked to 3,399 properties in 20 metropolitan areas and seven states, deal documents show. JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group (CS) led the offering.Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust (SWAY), managed by an affiliate of Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group, has also announced plans to sell bonds backed by properties. The Oakland, Calif.-based company has $1 billion invested in 7,400 rental homes and nonperforming loans.American Residential Properties (ARPI), a landlord with more than 4,000 homes, and Silver Bay Realty Trust (SBY), which owned 5,642 residences as of Dec. 31, also plans to sell the debt.Morningstar is expecting as many as 10 deals to come to market this year, according to Grow and Becky Cao, another managing director at Morningstar.'More Transparency'""More securitizations will bring more transparency and make more data available on the single-family rental market,"" Grow said.Wall Street may sell $5 billion in bonds backed by rental homes this year, a market that may grow to as much as $20 billion annually as debt from smaller operators is aggregated into securities, according to Ryan Stark, the head of U.S. mortgage finance at Deutsche Bank who led the structure and underwriting of the Blackstone transaction last year.Institutional investors have already tapped multiple financing sources for purchasing homes. American Homes 4 Rent, which went public last July, obtained a credit facility for as much as $1 billion from Wells Fargo. Silver Bay Realty Trust got a loan in May from Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan after selling shares to the public last year.Rising PricesWith home prices up 23% since a post-bubble low in March 2012 and bargains harder to find, some of the largest buyers have been scaling back purchases. Blackstone has reduced its pace of buying by 70% since last year, focusing its acquisitions on five markets — Seattle, Atlanta and the Florida cities of Tampa, Orlando and Miami, Jonathan Gray, the firm's global head of real estate, said in March.While their acquisitions slow, Blackstone and Colony are extending their reach into the rental business by offering financing to smaller landlords. Both companies, along with Cerberus Capital Management's First Key Lending, plan to package the loans as mortgage-backed securities.A portion of Blackstone's first securitization and the bond issues by Colony and American Homes 4 Rent got the highest rating from Moody's Investors Service, Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Morningstar.

2067,WFC,"With the S&P 500 pressing on to all-time highs, is the stock market too good to be true? Are we — shudder — approaching a bubble?
"
2068,WFC,"One way to gauge the risk is to look at the number of S&P 500 industries with nosebleed price-earnings ratios when the market bubble burst in March 2000. A P-E ratio of 30 or higher is often looked at as unsustainably high for most companies.
"
2069,WFC,"""Many investors think the market is overly expensive because they hear about it hitting a new high,"" said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, the nation's fourth largest broker-dealer and largest independent broker-dealer. ""And there are some (recent) highflying names like Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla Motors (TSLA). Biotech was hot too. But there just aren't that many bubbly industries.""
"
2070,WFC,"As the bubble was bursting 14 years ago, 16 of the S&P 500's 62 industries had P-E ratios topping 30. That accounted for 70% of S&P 500 companies' total market value.
"
2071,WFC,"Of course, the market doesn't need to be in a bubble the size of 2000's to portend a big sell-off, but the absence of a bubble reduces the risk of a market blowoff.

"
2075,WFC,"""Those are companies that create capital goods used by other businesses,"" he said. ""I like the segment because business spending is rising."" Many names in that space — and other nonfrothy industries — are badly beaten down due to anemic spending last year.
"
2076,WFC,"General Electric (GE) is one likely beneficiary, Kleintop says. ""Transportation and railroad equipment has been in high demand,"" he said.
"
2077,WFC,"Illinois Tool Works (ITW) should benefit from the manufacturing renaissance, he says. They make goods used to expand or revamp factories.
"
2078,WFC,"Tech hardware is a second segment that should gain from increased capital goods spending. Business hiring in general is climbing. That should boost hardware and services revenues for IBM (IBM), Kleintop says.

2079,WFC,"Regional banks are a third segment Kleintop likes. PNC (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) stand to gain from more borrowing as the economy warms. Also, rising rates make lending more profitable. PNC has IBD's Composite Rating of 91.

"
2117,WFC,"The health of the real estate market improved markedly in 2013, yet mortgage lending and the securitization of loans are still on government life support.
"
2118,WFC,"Experts have been taking residential lending's vital signs, but their prognoses are mixed. Some believe nonagency securitization will rise this year, albeit modestly. Others say new government lending rules and continued dominance of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) will limit any small rebound in nonagency securitization.
"
2119,WFC,"With securitization, investment banks pool contractual debt, such as residential or commercial mortgages, credit card debt or auto loans, and sell this pooled debt to investors as bonds or other investment instruments. Residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities are two typical pool types.
"
2120,WFC,"At the end of December, credit-rating service Standard & Poor's issued its 2014 outlook, ""U.S. Housing and Residential Mortgage Finance,"" stating: ""We expect nonagency securitization volume in 2014 to reach almost $40 billion. This is approximately 30% higher than the 2013 expectation of $29 billion.""
"
2121,WFC,"Lending experts take issue with the report. ""We have really yet to see of any recurrence of any private securitization market,"" said David Stevens, CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"
2122,WFC,"He says the total lending market in 2013 was $1.7 trillion and will be $1.12 trillion in 2014, nearly all of it backed by the GSEs — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So, he added, ""we are a long ways away from relieving ourselves from our overdependence on the government.""
"
2123,WFC,"""The securitization markets are still not ready to operate at scale and likely won't be in 2014,"" said Brad Blackwell, executive vice president at Wells Fargo (WFC).
"
2124,WFC,"Rules And Ratings
"
2125,WFC,"What's limiting private securitization? Again, answers are mixed. But the new qualified mortgage (QM) rules, which took effect Jan. 10, aren't helping, say experts. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules are a strict set of lending guidelines, intended to ensure a borrower's ability to repay the loan.
"
2126,WFC,"Learning the new rules is making lenders skittish enough, but not adhering to these standards has a specific legal bite. Under the QM rules, banks are legally liable when they issue loans to clients deemed unable to make repayments.
"
2127,WFC,"So non-QM lending is riskier. ""There's a lot of uncertainty over that (legal obligation) and a lot of risk for nonqualified loans,"" said Mary Ann McGarry, CEO of Guild Mortgage in San Diego.
"
2128,WFC,"Furthermore, experts say if loans get packaged for investors, into nongovernment-backed securities, those need to be rated.
"
2129,WFC,"But the real estate bust and the crash of the mortgage bonds market brought criticism of the ratings agencies for inadequately scrutinizing mortgage securities.
"
2130,WFC,"There is an ""extraordinary lack of confidence in the ratings agencies,"" said Stevens.
"
2131,WFC,"Sharif Mahdavian, analytical manager for S&P's residential mortgage-backed securities ratings, says several steps are needed to attract more private money back into securitizing loans.
"
2132,WFC,"If the private market securitizes mortgages again, lending would ease as banks would have another outlet for selling debt off their books. But investment banks need to grasp what they're securitizing, and investors in these financial instruments must have confidence they know what they're buying.
"
2133,WFC,"Mahdavian said there needs to be ""more transparency in the marketing of nonagency securities ... more robust reporting on a loan level basis and more confidence in the due diligence done on the loans.""
"
2134,WFC,"Some banks are doing non-QM loans and buying QM loans from smaller lenders. Wells Fargo is one. Others include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).
"
2135,WFC,"Wells is making QM- and non-QM jumbo loans to ""strong borrowers with a strong ability to repay,"" said Blackwell, adding, ""We are not securitizing any of our nonagency business and don't intend to do so in 2014. We like the returns and quality we're getting with nonconforming mortgages.""
"
2136,WFC,"Blackwell says his operation at Wells Fargo also will continue to buy and hold in its portfolio loans from ""correspondent lenders that meet the QM rules"" in 2014.
"
2137,WFC,"Blackwell said that ""nonconforming interest rates today are lower than conforming ... and that's a barrier to private securitization coming in."" He notes that nonconforming rates stand a quarter of a percent lower for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages and ""as much as 3/4% lower"" for adjustable rate mortgages that are fixed for five years and adjust annually.
"
2138,WFC,"He says these lower rates are less attractive to entities that might want to securitize loans, since returns are lower and risk higher.
"
2139,WFC,"So who is securitizing non-GSE mortgages, according to S&P? Real estate investment trusts such as Redwood Trust (RWT) and Two Harbors Investment (TWO).
"
2140,WFC,"S&P officials admit it's a small part of the overall lending market, but it's finally showing growth. ""When we wrote this report, we were talking about a nonagency market that has been virtually dead for the past few years,"" said S&P's Mahdavian. ""Forty billion . .. it's still extremely small ... but it's a positive pattern.""
"
2141,WFC,"Mahdavian also says lending will continue to be tight for real estate investors in 2014. ""It's very hard for investors in this environment,"" he said. ""The default expectations for investor loans are higher"" than for owner-occupied loans.
"
2142,WFC,"Also, investors are facing much more competition for properties with investment potential from REITs and hedge funds.
"
2143,WFC,"Carrie Nikols, principal and chief lending officer at Nikols Co. in Newport Beach, Calif., says her company used to provide funding to investors rehabbing and selling foreclosures. With those investments becoming scarcer, and financing for homebuyers tighter, her company is doing 12-month bridge lending to commercial real estate investors. These are borrowers who are ""restructuring or acquiring a distressed asset for repositioning,"" she said.
"
2144,WFC,"Risk Sharing
"
2145,WFC,"A small boost for the private securitization market is coming from government-sponsored enterprises themselves. The GSEs have committed to doing more risk-sharing bonds in 2014, securities created by the GSEs and sold into the private market. The GSEs have made three such offerings, two by Fannie Mae and one by Freddie Mac.
"
2146,WFC,"""The GSE risk-sharing transactions have had huge popularity,"" said Mahdavian.
"
2147,WFC,"The Mortgage Bankers Association has been actively pushing a proposal to enable even more risk sharing with GSEs at loan origination, by a borrower ""getting private mortgage insurance, covering the first 50% or 60% of the loan (or potential loss),"" said Stevens. ""This would shift the risk away from the taxpayer and more to the private insurance business"" and private sector.
"
2148,WFC,"Stevens says loans, under this proposed program, likely would be competitive or potentially cheaper than today's mortgages.
"
2149,WFC,"That's because although borrowers would buy more mortgage insurance, the GSEs could lower their guarantee fees because they'd be exposed to less risk.The health of the real estate market improved markedly in 2013, yet mortgage lending and the securitization of loans are still on government life support.Experts have been taking residential lending's vital signs, but their prognoses are mixed.

""There's a lot of uncertainty over that (legal obligation) and a lot of risk for nonqualified loans,"" said Mary Ann McGarry, CEO of Guild Mortgage in San Diego.Furthermore, experts say if loans get packaged for investors, into nongovernment-backed securities, those need to be rated.But the real estate bust and the crash of the mortgage bonds market brought criticism of the ratings agencies for inadequately scrutinizing mortgage securities.There is an ""extraordinary lack of confidence in the ratings agencies,"" said Stevens.Sharif Mahdavian, analytical manager for S&P's residential mortgage-backed securities ratings, says several steps are needed to attract more private money back into securitizing loans.If the private market securitizes mortgages again, lending would ease as banks would have another outlet for selling debt off their books. But investment banks need to grasp what they're securitizing, and investors in these financial instruments must have confidence they know what they're buying.Mahdavian said there needs to be ""more transparency in the marketing of nonagency securities ... more robust reporting on a loan level basis and more confidence in the due diligence done on the loans.""Some banks are doing non-QM loans and buying QM loans from smaller lenders. Wells Fargo is one. Others include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).Wells is making QM- and non-QM jumbo loans to ""strong borrowers with a strong ability to repay,"" said Blackwell, adding, ""We are not securitizing any of our nonagency business and don't intend to do so in 2014. We like the returns and quality we're getting with nonconforming mortgages.""Blackwell says his operation at Wells Fargo also will continue to buy and hold in its portfolio loans from ""correspondent lenders that meet the QM rules"" in 2014.Blackwell said that ""nonconforming interest rates today are lower than conforming ... and that's a barrier to private securitization coming in."" He notes that nonconforming rates stand a quarter of a percent lower for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages and ""as much as 3/4% lower"" for adjustable rate mortgages that are fixed for five years and adjust annually.He says these lower rates are less attractive to entities that might want to securitize loans, since returns are lower and risk higher.So who is securitizing non-GSE mortgages, according to S&P? Real estate investment trusts such as Redwood Trust (RWT) and Two Harbors Investment (TWO).S&P officials admit it's a small part of the overall lending market, but it's finally showing growth. ""When we wrote this report, we were talking about a nonagency market that has been virtually dead for the past few years,"" said S&P's Mahdavian. ""Forty billion . .. it's still extremely small ... but it's a positive pattern.""Mahdavian also says lending will continue to be tight for real estate investors in 2014. ""It's very hard for investors in this environment,"" he said. ""The default expectations for investor loans are higher"" than for owner-occupied loans.Also, investors are facing much more competition for properties with investment potential from REITs and hedge funds.Carrie Nikols, principal and chief lending officer at Nikols Co. in Newport Beach, Calif., says her company used to provide funding to investors rehabbing and selling foreclosures. With those investments becoming scarcer, and financing for homebuyers tighter, her company is doing 12-month bridge lending to commercial real estate investors. These are borrowers who are ""restructuring or acquiring a distressed asset for repositioning,"" she said.Risk SharingA small boost for the private securitization market is coming from government-sponsored enterprises themselves. The GSEs have committed to doing more risk-sharing bonds in 2014, securities created by the GSEs and sold into the private market. The GSEs have made three such offerings, two by Fannie Mae and one by Freddie Mac.""The GSE risk-sharing transactions have had huge popularity,"" said Mahdavian.The Mortgage Bankers Association has been actively pushing a proposal to enable even more risk sharing with GSEs at loan origination, by a borrower ""getting private mortgage insurance, covering the first 50% or 60% of the loan (or potential loss),"" said Stevens. ""This would shift the risk away from the taxpayer and more to the private insurance business"" and private sector.Stevens says loans, under this proposed program, likely would be competitive or potentially cheaper than today's mortgages.That's because although borrowers would buy more mortgage insurance, the GSEs could lower their guarantee fees because they'd be exposed to less risk.

2185,WFC,"As mortgage rates rise, subprime loan products are expected to creep back into the lending mix in a more meaningful way.And that could be a catalyst for homebuilders with high exposure to entry-level buyers, said Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless in a research note this week.He says KB Home (KBH) may be the ""best positioned"" of homebuilders to benefit from the returning product, which all but vanished after the housing market crashed.Not only does KB Home cater to first-time buyers, it already has a relationship with mortgage servicer Nationstar Mortgage (NSM), which is one of the companies seen growing subprime product. Another emerging player: Wells Fargo (WFC).Other builders that should benefit from greater availability of subprime credit are D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes (BZH), and MDC Holdings (MDC), McCanless said, noting that entry-level homes account for 40% or more of their sales mix.Los Angeles-based KB Home has long targeted first-time buyers. But as tight credit shut many would-be first-timers out of the market in the last few years, the company has been shifting into the move-up market more. Builders' shift to higher-priced product has left holes in the entry market.""We have many first-time buyers who are trying to find a foothold in the market,"" said Geoff McIntosh, co-owner of Main Street Realtors in Long Beach, Calif., which is south of Los Angeles. But supply is tight and new construction in the entry-level market on the coast is ""insignificant,"" he added.Entry-level buyers made up just 26% of existing home sales nationwide in January, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's down from the 40% to 45% historic norm.""We anticipate a return of subprime lending could close the gap between the 26% and the historical 40%-to-45% range and potentially lift the gross amount of home sales higher in a given month,"" McCanless wrote.KB Home, for one, might finally be in the right place at the right time with its original focus on first-time buyers. Shares have moved up roughly 10% in three days.

""We have concluded that Ocwen made troubled borrowers even more vulnerable to foreclosure.""Under the agreement, Ocwen also will refund a combined $125 million to about 185,000 borrowers who had been foreclosed upon from 2009 through 2012.The company agreed as well to change the way it manages mortgages. Ocwen must stop ""robo-signing"" of documents, which is the practice of automatically signing off on foreclosures without a proper review.The agreement still must be approved by a federal court in Washington.Ocwen said in a statement it was pleased to have reached the settlement.The agreement ""is in alignment with the same ultimate goals that we share with the regulators — to prevent foreclosures and help struggling families keep their homes,"" the company said.Ocwen is the fourth-largest mortgage servicer in the country and the biggest one that isn't a bank. It specializes in servicing high-risk mortgages.Servicing companies collect payments from borrowers and handle customer services, loan modifications and foreclosures.Federal and state regulators have signed agreements with a number of large banks and mortgage processing companies over foreclosure abuses.Ocwen's compliance with the settlement will be overseen by Joseph A. Smith Jr., the monitor for the $25 billion settlement reached in February 2012 between the federal government and the states and five major banks — Ally Financial, Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Roots Of Robo-SigningThe housing crisis struck starting in 2007, as American home values sank and millions of borrowers defaulted on their mortgages.

Oklahoma is the only state that decided not to participate.The largest share of the mortgage relief, an estimated $342 million, is expected to go to Florida.

Let’s quickly scan through the key facts from this San Francisco-based money center bank’s earnings release this morning:An Earnings MissWells Fargo came out with adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12. Lower revenues and higher expenses were primarily responsible for the miss. Results were in line with the prior-year quarter earnings.How Was the Estimate Revision Trend?You should note that the earnings estimate for Wells Fargo depicted neutral stance prior to the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the last seven days.    Wells Fargo has a decent earnings surprise history. Before posting earnings miss in Q2, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the prior four quarters. Overall, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 0.71% in the trailing four quarters. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteRevenue Came In Higher Than Expected    Wells Fargo posted revenues of $21.6 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.5 billion.

"
2223,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) slipped marginally during regular trading hours Thursday, just one day before the embattled baking giant releases its latest quarterly financial results. Investors seemed just a little hesitant ahead of the report, but WFC is still a stock to pay close attention to once the results are in.In theory, rising short-term interest rates should be lifting big banking stocks. However, with the yield curve flattening as investors worry about the current long-term macroeconomic growth outlook, there is a general sense of uncertainty around the industry. This could mean that big-name banks like Wells Fargo will need to blow away investors in order to regain some momentum.Now let’s take a look at what investors should expect from Wells Fargo’s Q2 earnings report. Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for the company to report revenue of $21.57 billion, which would mark a roughly 2.7% dip from the year-ago period. At the other end of the income statement, Wells Fargo is expected to see its adjusted earnings climb by 4.7% to hit $1.12 per share.Meanwhile, investors should also note that WFC’s quarterly earnings revisions activity has been mixed recently. The company has earned one upward earnings estimate revision within the last seven days, against two downward changes. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen by three cents within the last 90 days. Wells Fargo’s mixed revision activity has helped contribute to its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Moving onto WFC’s stock price performance, investors might be pleased to note that shares of Wells Fargo have surged roughly 9.9% over the last three months, which tops the S&P 500’s 4.8% climb. More recently, shares of WFC have cooled off a bit, up around 1.4% over the last four weeks.With all that said, a solid earnings beat might be exactly the jolt Wells Fargo needs. And to gauge how likely the bank is to outperform estimates tomorrow morning, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Wells Fargo currently sports an Earnings ESP of -0.12% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which means our model is inconclusive about if Wells Fargo might top estimates when it reports its Q2 results before the opening bell on Friday. Investors should note that the bank has topped or matched earnings estimates in five out of the last six quarters.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis once Wells Fargo reports!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2224,WFC,"Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) added about 0.4% during regular hours Thursday, the last day of trading before it releases its latest quarterly earnings report. Investors displayed some apathy ahead of the report, but this is certainly still a stock to watch once the full results are in.Our rising rate environment should be acting as a catalyst for big bank stocks, but instead, a flattening yield curve has led to a sense of malaise in the industry. This could mean that giants like JPMorgan will need to report exceptionable quarterly results in order to reinvigorate investors.According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts expect JPMorgan to report earnings of $2.22 per share on $27.60 billion in revenue. These results would mark year-over-year growth rates of 22% and 8%, respectively.Investors should also note the JPM’s consensus earnings projection has fluctuated over the course of the quarter. A few positive revisions have helped the Zacks Consensus Estimate tick two cents higher in the past 90 days, but this estimate is now two cents lower than the peak it reached about 60 days ago. This mixed revision activity has contributed to the stock’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at share price performance, JPM has added about 15% over the past year. However, the stock has been sluggish as of late and remains essentially flat on a year-to-date basis. More recently, shares have dropped about 2.5% over the trailing 12 weeks.A strong earnings beat might be what JPM needs in order to start generating positive momentum. To gauge how likely the company is to outperform estimates tomorrow morning, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.JPM currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.06%. This, combined with its Zacks Rank, make us feel comfortable about its chances at beating earnings estimates on Friday. JPMorgan has notched 10 quarters of earnings outperformance in a row.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis once JPMorgan reports! Industry rivals Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) will also be reporting on Friday morning. Want more market analysis from this author?

2225,WFC,"On today’s episode of Free Lunch, Associate Stock Strategist Ryan McQueeney touches on the latest analyst sentiment and investor reactions to news affecting trending stocks like Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Later, he is joined by Dave Bartosiak to preview Friday morning’s big bank earnings reports.Want more video content from Zacks? Subscribe to Zacks Investment News now!Free Lunch is the newest show from Zacks Investment Research. It is streamed live, four times per week, and features breaking news and analysis from Zacks strategists. Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Facebook Live, Twitter, Ustream, and more.Up first, Ryan discusses Broadcom’s rough morning of trading after the chip behemoth announced it is purchasing CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. CA is a giant in the mainframe software industry, but that business is falling out of favor as customers continue to shift toward cloud computing.So why would Broadcom shell out so much cash for a dated brand? Some have said desperation after its Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) merger fell through, while others have suggested it might be another moment of brilliance from CEO Hock Tan.Ryan digs into these reactions and gives his own perspective on the story. Next, the host analyst notes related to Netflix and Amazon which have hogged headlines this morning.Netflix shares dipped in early trading after analysts from UBS lowered their rating to neutral from buy, citing the video streaming giant’s stretched valuation. Eric Sheridan, the leading analyst on UBS’ note, credited Netflix’s work in content and technology, but ultimately described the goods news as “priced in” to the stock.On the opposite end of the spectrum was Canaccord Genuity’s note on Amazon, which included a new $2,000 price target for the e-commerce stock. Ryan discusses both notes and shares his thoughts on Netflix, Amazon, and other “FAANG” stocks on the first half of today’s show.On the second half of the episode, Ryan is joined by Zacks Strategist Dave Bartosiak to preview Friday morning’s top bank earnings reports from the likes of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Rising rates should be a catalyst for these big financials, but a flattening yield curve has led to apathy from analysts—a feeling that both Dave and Ryan mirror. Nevertheless, make sure to check out the episode to hear exactly what they have to say about the big banks!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2226,WFC,"The second-quarter 2018 earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names — JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) — all reporting financial numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.After an impressive first-quarter performance driven by significant volatility, major banks lost momentum on the flattening of the yield curve. Therefore, net interest margin (the backbone for banks’ top-line growth) is expected to have remained subdued in the second quarter.Further, volatility-driven growth in trading revenues, which supported the top line during the January-March quarter, is likely to be muted in the second quarter. Though uncertainty mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions induced volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels. Therefore, not much support is expected from this source of revenues, primarily for big banks.In addition to benefits from rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), and consumer loans, to some extent.Mortgage business is anticipated to have continued to witness a slowdown in the April-June quarter. With interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this source.Further, investment banking performance is anticipated to have been flat. Strong equity issuances globally might have been boosted by IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to have escalated. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely have helped banks garner advisory fees. These are, however, expected to have been more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will have limited corporates’ involvement in these activities.Additionally, credit quality is likely to have remained strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might have escalated costs moderately.In addition, passage of the new law to lessen banks’ regulatory burden and lower tax rates will have supported bottom-line growth.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in second-quarter 2018 are projected to rise 8.5% year over year.Let’s take a look at the four major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow.JPMorgan will report the second-quarter earnings before the opening bell. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +0.06%, the chances of a likely earnings beat in the quarter to be reported are bright. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Client activity returned to normalized levels in the to-be-reported quarter. So, this will likely have led to relatively stable trading revenues in the quarter. Nonetheless, similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to have supported total trading revenues in the second quarter. A modest improvement in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — will likely have led to an increase in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support to the stock, despite flattening of the yield curve (Read more: Trading & Loan Growth to Drive JPMorgan's Q2 Earnings).Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteOn Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo, is also slated to announce results. Wells Fargo is likely to have benefited from easing margin and high interest income, though marginally, in Q2. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent. Nonetheless, mounting expenses resulting from legal costs and low mortgage business are expected to dent this banking giant’s results. (Read more: Will Legal Hassles Impact Wells Fargo's Q2 Earnings?).Wells Fargo posted an average beat of 0.71% over the preceding four quarters, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of them, as demonstrated in the chart below:Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteFor another big bank, Citigroup, we cannot conclusively predict earnings beat in the quarter, as higher credit costs are expected to have hurt its financials. Moreover, volatility-driven trading revenues are expected to have remained flat year over year in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the company is anticipated to witness improvement in consumer banking revenues, while pressure on margins is likely to somewhat ease. Notably, the equities business is expected to have remained strong in the quarter to be reported, whereas the fixed income business might have experienced a disappointing performance. (Read more: Will Flattish Trading Dampen Citigroup's Q2 Earnings?).Further, this Zacks #3 Ranked stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citigroup Inc. QuoteLikewise, we cannot conclusively predict earnings beat for PNC Financial in the second quarter, with an Earnings ESP of -0.23% and a Zacks Rank #3. Given the improvement in the lending scenario, net interest income (NII) is expected to improve, while flattening of yield curve will likely somewhat hurt. Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, consumer services revenues are expected to have improved. Additionally, despite a slowdown in refinancing activities during the quarter under review, due to the persistent rise in rates, mortgage originations were decent. Thus, residential mortgage revenues are also expected to have witnessed a modest improvement.However, though management expects non-interest expenses to be up in low-single digits on a sequential basis, the company’s continued efforts toward its cost-saving program are likely to keep overall expenses under control. (Read more: What's in Store for PNC Financial in Q2 Earnings?)Having beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters, PNC Financial posted an average beat of 2.6%.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Check later our full write-up on earnings releases of these stocks.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2227,WFC,"Big banks will start reporting their Q2 earnings results this week. Let’s take a closer look at the possible earnings picture of the six big banking companies that could drive the performance of the sector. This is especially true as the Major Banks industry accounts for about half of the sector’s earnings.According to our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Inside Our Surprise PredictionAmong the big six, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) are likely to report on Jul 13.JPM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +1.19%. This enhances the chances of an earnings beat this quarter. Wells Fargo, with a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of +0.33%, also has higher chances of an earnings beat.The case is different for Citigroup. A Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -2.56% lower the predictive power of ESP because a favorable Zacks Rank when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is expected to report on Jul 16 before the market opens. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -6.10%. Needless to say, surprise prediction is tough here.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Jul 18. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -3.12%. Here as well, an earnings beat is difficult to predict.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -0.54%, which dims chances of a beat.What Does ESP Tell About Bank ETFs?As discussed above, chances of a broad-based earnings beat are low as only two out of the six have a positive ESP. Total Q2 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry are expected to rise 8.2% from the same period last year. This would follow the industry’s 25.4% earnings growth in the preceding quarter, per the Earnings Trendsissued on Jul 5.The segment should pick up pace starting Q3 with the final two quarters of the year expected to see 11% and 15.3% growth, respectively. Fed’s policy tightening and the consequent higher bond yields as well as Trump’s deregulation and fiscal reflation should benefit the space.Market ImpactDespite the not-so-encouraging earnings prospects, investors might want to keep an eye on financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF IYF, Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) owing to upbeat factors like deregulation in the banking sector and faster Fed policy tightening. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (read: How Financial ETFs Look After Fed Stress Test).Goldman has moderate exposure to the aforementioned ETFs and is rather heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report). These ETFs have added 0.73% to 1.86% in the past five days (as of Jul 10). However, the returns in the space were lower than 2.53% offered by the S&P 500-based ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) (see all Financial ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2228,WFC,"We’re still pretty quiet here on the Western front, awaiting the deluge of Q2 earnings results that begins with the spigot opening for big banks — JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) among them Friday — before opening up to the publicly traded industries at large, starting next week. Though we do have a new economic read worth looking at.June Producer Price Index (PPI) numbers have hit the tape this morning, posting gains of 0.3% on the headline — 10 basis points hotter than expected, though still down from the +0.5% reported in May. Interestingly, subtracting the often-volatile food and energy costs we still see a tally of 0.3%. Year over year, this ex-food & energy number is 2.8%, higher than the 2.6% expected and the 2.4% in the previous read.This indicates that producer pricing is experiencing inflation — though still relatively slow, especially in light of historically low unemployment (which usually leads to spiking wage increases) and a Q2 GDP number some analysts expect to reach 4% or higher. If the PPI continues to ramp up at sub-3% levels considering everything else going on in the economy, we can still behave as if we’re Goldilocks — enjoying that which is not too hot, not too cold.Also this morning, although not a marquee name nor a fixture on the S&P 500 (let alone the Dow 30), Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report) — a $14 billion market-cap manufacturing company which develops and markets fasteners for all sorts of Construction and Manufacturing goods — outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines ahead of the opening bell. Earnings of 74 cents per share on $1.27 billion topped estimates of 66 cents and $1.26 billion, respectively. For more on FAST's Q2 earnings, click here.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rose initially 7.5% upon the release of its Q2 report, settling back to gains of roughly 6.6% a half hour ahead of the market open. Tomorrow, we anticipate quarterly earnings from airline major Delta (DAL  -  Free Report), which is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock.Market futures are in the red this morning, however, as an apparent resurgence of trade war fears appear to be resurfacing. Either that or President Trump’s harsh words for Germany ahead of the NATO summit today in Brussels may have awoken market bears in our otherwise idyllic trading scenario.

2230,WFC,"The long-awaited (unofficial) start to Q2 earnings season is finally upon us with this morning’s influx of major Wall Street banks reporting results, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). These arrive as roughly 5% of the S&P 500 have already reported quarterly results, mostly those with fiscal quarters ending in May, not June.Before we splash into that pool, however, we also see a new read on Import Prices for June: the Import Price Index slipped 0.4% last month, following a 0.9% jump in May and well off the +0.6% analysts were expecting. This is the largest monthly drop since February of this year. These month-by-month figures do have a bent toward more volatility that smooths out year over year, however. To wit, we still see Import Prices up 4.3% from June 2017.U.S. Exports rose 0.3% in June, halving the 0.6% gains from the previous month. We are not prepared, at this hour, to make any speculation regarding Import/Export numbers in the months ahead, especially with the day-to-day static of trade tariff turmoil potentially making analysts weary of future results in these metrics. What we do know is that, despite somewhat of a disappointment in the June numbers, U.S. import and export business has proven strong over the past year.Speaking of strong, JPMorgan once again outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines for its Q2 earnings report this morning: earnings of $2.29 per share topped estimates of $2.22, while revenues reaching $28.39 billion surpassed both the $27.66 billion in the Zacks consensus and the year-ago figure of $26.7 billion.Investment banking, fixed income and equity market revenues all posted notable gains year over year — the latter which posted an impressive 24% gain. For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.Citigroup also outpaced Zacks consensus estimates for both earnings and revenues in its Q2 report — $1.62 versus $1.54 per share on the bottom line, and $18.5 billion versus $18.4 billion on the top. This marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat, and is especially impressive compared to year-ago earnings of $1.28 per share.Revenues and net income rose year over year, whereas fixed income fell 6% from the June 2017 quarter. For more on C’s earnings, click here.The only real disappointment in big bank earnings this morning has come from Wells Fargo & Co., which posted mixed results in its June quarter: $1.08 per share versus the $1.12 earnings estimate, on $21.6 billion in revenues that eked out the $21.5 billion expected.While revenues remained generally in-line, average deposits fell 2% year over year, as the company continues to dig out from its reputational issues, costing the bank more money in targeted sales and marketing objectives. For more on WFC’s earnings, click here.Often overlooked due to the long shadows cast by its larger-cap brethren, PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) also posted easy beats on its headline earnings and revenues for Q2 2018. The Pittsburgh-based bank reached $2.72 per share on $4.35 billion in quarterly revenues, besting the $2.58 per share and $4.25 billion, respectively.This is a larger beat that the trailing 4-quarter average of +2.6%, with net margins up year over year. For more on PNC’s earnings click here.

2232,WFC,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total earnings for the 22 S&P 500 members that have reported fiscal May-quarter results (part of our Q2 tally) are up +29% on +12.5% higher revenues. The proportion of these early reporters beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods.  •    For the S&P 500 index as a whole, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19.1% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, in contrast to the very strong positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the start of the Q1 earnings season.•    Q2 estimates for the Energy, Construction, Basic Materials and Tech sectors went up since the quarter got underway, while estimates for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, Finance, and Conglomerate sectors have gone down.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +23.8% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.5% from the same period last year on +3.6% higher revenues.•    Other major sectors with strong expected growth in Q2 include Energy (+139.7% earnings growth), Basic Materials (+53.6%), Industrial Products (+24.5%) and Retail (+18.4%). The Autos and Conglomerates sectors are the only ones expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +27% on +8.2% higher revenues, which would follow +24.2% earnings growth on +8.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +20.3% on +6.2% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.7% in 2019, and +4.5% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of July 10th, is $156.51. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.78 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.34 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season Gets UnderwayThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 13th releases from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). But the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway, with results from 22 S&P 500 members already out. All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total earnings for these 22 index members are up +29% on +12.5% higher revenues, with 90.9% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% beating revenue estimates.It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results, but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 22 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods.These two standout trends pertain to revenue growth momentum and more numerous EPS surprises, as the comparison charts below show.Q2 Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.1% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology.

2233,WFC,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total earnings for the 22 S&P 500 members that have reported fiscal May-quarter results (part of our Q2 tally) are up +29% on +12.5% higher revenues. The proportion of these early reporters beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods.  •    For the S&P 500 index as a whole, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19.1% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, in contrast to the very strong positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the start of the Q1 earnings season.•    Q2 estimates for the Energy, Construction, Basic Materials and Tech sectors went up since the quarter got underway, while estimates for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, Finance, and Conglomerate sectors have gone down.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +23.8% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.5% from the same period last year on +3.6% higher revenues.•    Other major sectors with strong expected growth in Q2 include Energy (+139.7% earnings growth), Basic Materials (+53.6%), Industrial Products (+24.5%) and Retail (+18.4%). The Autos and Conglomerates sectors are the only ones expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +27% on +8.2% higher revenues, which would follow +24.2% earnings growth on +8.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +20.3% on +6.2% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.7% in 2019, and +4.5% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of July 10th, is $156.51. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.78 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.34 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season Gets UnderwayThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 13th releases from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). But the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway, with results from 22 S&P 500 members already out. All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total earnings for these 22 index members are up +29% on +12.5% higher revenues, with 90.9% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% beating revenue estimates.It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results, but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 22 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods.These two standout trends pertain to revenue growth momentum and more numerous EPS surprises, as the comparison charts below show.Q2 Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.1% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +139.7%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15.7%.  The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The chart below shows the same data on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which tends to smooth out the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations to a large extent.The smoother growth trend of the above chart shows that the growth rate will continue to gain pace through the end of this year and start decelerating from that point onwards.But more important than the growth rate is the trend on revisions front, which turned out to be underwhelming ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings, particularly relative to what we experienced in the comparable period in the Q1 earnings season. We will see if this trend will continue with Q3 estimates as companies report Q2 results and share trends in their businesses.Given the ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar, questions about the global economy and all-around trade uncertainty, it is possible that estimates for Q3 and beyond come down in the coming days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2235,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been embroiled in one scandal after another for more than one and a half years. Troubles have been mounting at Wells Fargo since the revelation of the sales scandal, which was followed by disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business, online bill pay services and the Wealth and Investment Management segment. With the ongoing review process of business practices, more wrongdoings may be reported, consequently straining the top line.The mortgage business of Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed a slowdown in the second quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues will likely have remained low.However, management expects residential mortgage originations to increase in the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q2 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are likely to have improved slightly on a sequential basis during the April-June quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized in the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of collection and funding activities, the bank is positioned to start increasing originations over time, and currently estimates the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.Notably, based on the current pricing trends, management expects production margin to have declined further in second-quarter 2018.Net Interest Income (NII) Growth: NII growth is expected to have been decent, given modest loan and deposit growth, and rising net interest margin on rising rates.According to management, net interest income is predicted to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. It expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might have recorded escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings, during the quarter under review. Moreover, ongoing litigation hassles are expected to have resulted in elevated legal costs. Encouragingly, seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected to have dropped in the quarter, though salary expense is likely to have flared up.Non-Interest Revenues to Disappoint: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely have been recorded on market declines. Growth in trading revenues is predicted to have been muted as uncertainties, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions were not enough to induce volatility. In addition, trust income is likely to disappoint on lower equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP,and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.33%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings remained unchanged over the last seven days, calling for year-over-year growth of 4.7%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $21.6 billion, down 2.7% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 17.

2236,WFC,"After an impressive performance in the first quarter driven by significant volatility, client activity seems to have returned to normalized levels. Hence, Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading revenues are expected to be relatively stable in second-quarter 2018. As trading revenues are an important part of the bank’s top line, this will likely support to its results slated on Jul 16.The second quarter witnessed further escalation in the trade war and some other geo-political tensions. But these developments were not sufficient to result in a substantial increase in volatility and thus, client activity remained modest.Further, at an investors’ conference in May, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan stated that the company’s trading income is expected to be flat year over year in the second quarter.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $4.12 billion indicates a decline of 14% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s second-quarter results:Steady net interest income growth: A modest increase in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is expected result in improvement in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support despite flattening of the yield curve in the second quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.99 trillion for the second quarter indicates a marginal sequential improvement. This, along with decent lending activities is expected to further boost BofA’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, management expects NII, on an FTE basis, to decline roughly $120 million owing to the tax act.Muted investment banking performance: Increase in interest rates is likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuance activities. As debt origination fees account for major portion of total investment banking fees for BofA, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are expected to increase for BofA. Further, increasing M&As will likely lead to a slight rise in advisory revenues for the company.BofA’s investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $5 billion reflects a marginal rise on a sequential basis.Slowdown in mortgage banking business: With the refinance boom almost coming to end, a significant support is not expected from this operation. Also, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter as mortgage rates continued to move higher. As BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, mortgage banking is not expected to be a big help for the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $9.2 billion shows 1.8% rise from the prior quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support in the to-be reported quarter. Further, as BofA continues to digitize banking operations, upgrade technology and plans to expand into newer markets, related costs are expected to rise.But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall operating expenses are likely to remain manageable in the second quarter.In other developments, redemption of the trust preferred securities and the extinguishment of the related junior subordinated notes issued by BofA are expected to result in nearly $800 million of charge in the second quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -6.10%.Zacks Rank: BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 62 cents reflects 28.3% growth on a year-over-year basis. However, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.5 billion shows 1.3% fall from the prior-year quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few major bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around:Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 13.

2237,WFC,"After an impressive first-quarter performance driven by significant volatility, client activity has returned to normalized levels. So, this will likely result in relatively stable trading revenues for JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) in second-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute roughly one-fifth of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lend support to its results scheduled to be announced on Jul 13.Unlike the first quarter when higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, impending U.S.-China trade war and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility, developments like further escalation in the trade war and some other geo-political tensions in the second quarter were not enough to lead to substantial rise in client activity.Further, at an investors’ conference in May, JPMorgan’s head of Corporate and Investment Banking division, Daniel Pinto projected flat year-over-year markets revenues in the second quarter.Nonetheless, similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.75 billion reflects an increase of 10% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, per the consensus estimate, fixed income trading revenues will remain flat year over year at $3.22 billion.Apart from this, here are some of the other factors that are anticipated to influence JPMorgan’s second-quarter results:Steady rise in net interest income: A modest improvement in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — will likely lead to an increase in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support despite flattening of the yield curve in the second quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $2.21 trillion for the second quarter indicates an increase of 1.7% year over year. This along with decent lending activities is projected to boost the company’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.Subdued investment banking performance: Equity issuances across the globe seem to have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, JPMorgan is expected to record a slight increase in equity underwriting fees in the second quarter.Also, increasing global M&A activities will likely support the company’s advisory fees to some extent. Further, as JPMorgan remains at the top position when it comes to garnering global investment banking fees, this will likely provide the bank a leverage to attract more business.However, rise in rates is likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuance activities. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues to some extent.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter. As JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, as JPMorgan is aiming to enter newer markets by opening branches, expenses are likely to remain on the higher side. Further, increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings will result in a rise in costs.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:The chances of JPMorgan beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high this time as it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is +1.19%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The iconic brand reported earnings before the bell today, tallying profits which beat expectations and improved 8% from the year-ago period.Shares of PEP moved higher in morning trading, but a revenue miss and the relative irrelevance of consumer staples for many average investors kept reactions to the report muted. Ryan touches on this idea, and more, while reviewing PepsiCo’s earnings results.Next, the host highlights the growing uncertainty looming over the global oil industry as supply concerns continue to manifest. Today, Brent crude prices touched $79 per barrel as a strike in Norway and disruptions in Libya came to a head.

2239,WFC,"Market indexes are blossoming over the past week or so, even as global uncertainties begin to pile up regarding trade tensions with China and other important commerce partners, leadership issues in the U.K. ahead of tomorrow’s NATO meeting in Brussels, and elsewhere. But there is a bright, shining beacon markets appear to be attracted to currently: Q2 earnings season.Q2 may be among the strongest we’ve seen in our entire multi-year economic recovery (though Q1’s +24.6% year over year earnings growth will be tough to surmount), with a possible 4-handle on GDP for the quarter expected by a plurality of analysts later this month. Results from companies on the S&P 500 have already begun to start off this earnings season with a bang — companies like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates in past weeks — and expectations are big coming into the heart of Q2 reporting.We see at the end of this week some of the biggest banks in the country reporting, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). And, while year over year growth is expected to be substantial for these and companies like them, the Finance sector overall is underperforming the overall market. This has more to do with interest rate level questions and concerns about the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond than the machinations of the companies themselves.For a comprehensive view of banks’ performance and what to look for in Q2, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: What’s Keeping Bank Stocks Down?Ahead of today’s opening bell, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) put out a mixed earnings report, beating on the bottom line by a dime to $1.61 per share — up 7% in constant currency terms year over year. Revenues came in a smidge beneath expectations at $16.1 billion for the quarter, but shares are currently up about 2 1/2% in today’s pre-market.

2240,WFC,"Tuesday, July 10, 2018Market indexes are blossoming over the past week or so, even as global uncertainties begin to pile up regarding trade tensions with China and other important commerce partners, leadership issues in the U.K. ahead of tomorrow’s NATO meeting in Brussels, and elsewhere. But there is a bright, shining beacon markets appear to be attracted to currently: Q2 earnings season.Q2 may be among the strongest we’ve seen in our entire multi-year economic recovery (though Q1’s +24.6% year over year earnings growth will be tough to surmount), with a possible 4-handle on GDP for the quarter expected by a plurality of analysts later this month. Results from companies on the S&P 500 have already begun to start off this earnings season with a bang — companies like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates in past weeks — and expectations are big coming into the heart of Q2 reporting.We see at the end of this week some of the biggest banks in the country reporting, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). And, while year over year growth is expected to be substantial for these and companies like them, the Finance sector overall is underperforming the overall market. This has more to do with interest rate level questions and concerns about the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond than the machinations of the companies themselves.For a comprehensive view of banks’ performance and what to look for in Q2, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: What’s Keeping Bank Stocks Down?Ahead of today’s opening bell, Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) put out a mixed earnings report, beating on the bottom line by a dime to $1.61 per share — up 7% in constant currency terms year over year. Revenues came in a smidge beneath expectations at $16.1 billion for the quarter, but shares are currently up about 2 1/2% in today’s pre-market.

2241,WFC,"Over the last four trading days, banking stocks put up a lackluster show. Soft trading revenue outlook provided by some of the major banks hints at a bleak Q2 earnings picture. Additionally, softer loan demand is expected to add to these woes.Further, worries surrounding Italy’s rising debt yields and consequent concerns over the Eurozone’s financial stability are dealing a blow to U.S. bank stocks. The rising political uncertainty has put pressure on the European markets and cast a pall over Euro projects as well. Therefore, increasing demand for safe assets, like the U.S. debt, has brought down the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, triggering losses for banks in the United States.On the other side, the Federal Reserve, along with other key financial regulatory bodies, took another step toward easing the stringent regulations related to the Volcker Rule imposed on banks post 2008 financial crisis. The three-member Federal Reserve Board unanimously approved the proposals aimed at simplifying and improving the Volcker Rule. This might help banks strengthen lending as these firms are likely to benefit from better liquidity position.Nevertheless, coming to company-specific news, litigations and probes pertaining to the past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track, working toward resolving such issues and avoiding lengthy litigations.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending May 18, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. At the 2018 Deutsche Bank Eighth Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) hinted at the companies’ Q2 outlook.At the conference, Brian Moynihan — chief executive officer at BofA — stated that the company’s trading income is projected to be flat year over year in the second quarter. However, Moynihan expects things to turn around, depending on the bank’s activities in June.Furthermore, per Wells Fargo’s CFO, John Shrewsberry, the ongoing review process of the bank related to the sales practices issues is ""virtually complete"" and the company has shared all relevant information with investors. Commenting on commercial loan, the bank foresees demand to remain below expectations for 2018, despite anticipated business optimism following the U.S. tax reform.At the same conference, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking — Daniel Pinto — announced the company’s latest outlook for the April-June quarter. “Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,” Pinto said.Meanwhile, concerns have increased for investment bank — Morgan Stanley — thanks to the challenging business conditions in the ongoing quarter, which are affecting its wealth management unit. This unit, particularly, generates half of the bank's revenues. (Read more: Big Banks Forecast Lackluster Q2 Guidance, Muted Trading)2. Wells Fargo has received the judge’s approval for the settlement of $142 million worth class-action lawsuit related to the 3.5 million fake accounts scandal. However, the customers still have scope for filing claims if they feel having been wronged by the bank.The class-action lawsuit was an outcome of the bank’s undue pressure on its employees to achieve extensive sales targets, which led them to open unauthorized savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit from May 2002 to April 2017.The settlement would entertain claims of those clients who have been charged fees on the accounts that were opened without their consent. Also, refunds would be made to customers whose credit scores have been impacted by Wells Fargo’s improper practice and led to higher borrowing costs for them. Lastly, the remaining amount will be distributed equally among the claimants.3. According to Australia’s securities regulator and competition watchdog, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), along with Deutsche Bank AG (DB  -  Free Report) and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., will be sued with criminal charges for alleged “cartel” conduct over the sale of ANZ Bank’s shares worth $1.9 billion in Australia in 2015.In August 2015, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan were the underwriters for the institutional placement of nearly 80.8 million of ANZ Banks’ shares, which was conducted to raise capital in order to meet regulatory requirements.However, there were allegations that the joint underwriters, as part of their underwriting commitment, created a cartel arrangement, and hence reached an understanding for the disposal of 25.5 million shares that they had absorbed as part of the placement. The 25 million shares represented less than 1% of ANZ Bank’s outstanding shares at that time.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: CompanyLast Week6 monthsJPM-3.3%3.4%BAC-3.3%3.9%WFC-1.7%-3.1%C-2.6%-10.9%COF-0.9%3.1%USB-1.1%-8.3%PNC-3.2%3.0%Over the last four trading sessions, JPMorgan and BofA were the major losers, with their shares declining 3.3%.

2242,WFC,"On Wednesday, at the 2018 Deutsche Bank Eighth Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) hinted at the companies’ Q2 outlook.At the conference, Brian Moynihan — chief executive officer at BofA — stated that the company’s trading income is projected to be flat year over year in the second quarter, however things might turn around, depending on activities in June. Furthermore, the bank is likely to continue to benefit from disposing excess capital using share buybacks.Further, per Wells Fargo’s CFO John Shrewsberry, the ongoing review process of the bank related to the sales practices issues is ""virtually complete"" and the company has shared all relevant information with investors.""I don't think at this point that there's anything meaningful that we aren't already talking about,"" Shrewsberry said at the conference. Overall, the bank has succeeded in maintaining established customers, ""we haven't sold or deepened relationships as rapidly as we thought we would in terms of a recovery,"" Shrewsberry added.Commenting on commercial loan, the bank foresees demand to remain below expectations for 2018, despite anticipated business optimism following the U.S. tax reform.At the same conference on Tuesday, JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) head of corporate and investment banking — Daniel Pinto — announced the company’s latest outlook for the second quarter.“Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,” Pinto said. “The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat,” Pinto had noted.Additionally, though the bank is performing well in rates, commodities and corporate credit business, a quarterly charge of $100 million associated with the tax-oriented investment unit of its fixed income division will likely be recorded, Pinto had mentioned further. Moreover, investment banking business momentum is likely to continue.Meanwhile, concerns increased for investment bank — Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) — over challenging business conditions in the ongoing quarter, which are affecting its wealth management unit. This unit, particularly, generates half of the bank's revenues.During the conference, Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, stated that sluggish client activity in the months of March, April and May, has dampened Morgan Stanley’s retail transaction revenues.Furthermore, pricing of fee-based accounts is related to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter. The market was tumbling at the end of Q1, giving rise to low pricing of those accounts, thereby, hitting Morgan Stanley’s performance.ConclusionThe January-March quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes, on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks, since last September, to some extent. In addition, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports thwarted the stock market rally in Q1.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appeared that volatility was back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicated higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Nonetheless, banks are skeptical for the second quarter on global market turmoil and uncertainty of markets on the ongoing developments, including easing of regulations.Notably, shares of BofA and JPMorgan inched up 4.9% and 3.4%, respectively, while shares of Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley declined 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively, over the last six months. Among the above-mentioned stocks, Wells Fargo, BofA and JPMorgan currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

2244,WFC,"Per a Bloomberg article, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) plans to boost auto lending business as CEO Tim Sloan finds the commercial real estate (CRE) unit to be a concern.In an interview with Bloomberg, Sloan commented on auto lending by saying, “we’ve pulled back enough and now we’re going to be growing that business again”. In mid-2017, the bank had reduced focus on this business due to fall in reselling value for cars. Decline in prices made it difficult for the bank to offset losses by repossessing cars in cases of default by borrowers.However, in February 2018, Wells Fargo indicated plans to consolidate its auto lending units and put the division back on track within two quarters.Regarding CRE, Sloan said that some deals had been insignificant. He noted that 2018 gave a good start to the business. The market at the time was enjoying benefits from lower tax rates and improved consumer spending, which made the buyers more aggressive.Having seen so much since the fake account scandal in September 2016, troubles at Wells Fargo still seem to continue. Last week, the bank brought to the notice of the regulators that employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information of clients, without their knowledge, between late 2017 and first few months of 2018.Affected by a horde of scandals, Wells Fargo has been trying hard to control costs and concentrate on more profitable segments. In its Investors’ Day, held on May 10, the bank said that it expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019.We believe that Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan will help it deal with persistent legal expenses. Also, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position supported by lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 2.2% in the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 18.1%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This further created tension among investors resulting in huge selloffs.Treasury Yield Continues to be HighThe benchmark 10-year note yield continued to be above the psychological mark of 3% on Friday.

2246,WFC,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) has jumped on the bandwagon and seeks to strengthen its retail deposit base with the help of technology. The company plans to introduce a new app, likely be launched in the current quarter, which is expected to help grow deposits. The app is also expected to support expansion of its wealth management operations.With no intention to open new branches, Citigroup’s plan seems to be the best option. David Chubak, head of Citigroup’s global retail banking and mortgage, citing customer research conducted by the bank, said, “People are willing to switch to a bank that is able to provide this kind of mobile-first experience.”With just around 700 branches in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco, Citigroup has the lowest number (in terms of number of branches) among the big banks. Notably, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) has roughly 5,100 branches, Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) 4,400 and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) 5,800.This gap is expected to further widen with JPMorgan and Bank of America planning to expand to newer areas by opening branches along with their apps. Further, Citigroup’s cost of deposits is among the highest, as a large portion comes from institutional and wealthy clients who demand higher interest rates.Therefore, as Citigroup plans to lower its cost of funding amid increasing competition for deposits (due to increase in interest rates), online-only bank is a good option. The bank’s new app will still face competition from JPMorgan’s Finn, Aspiration, digital bank of Ally Financial and Marcus by Goldman Sachs.Also, as the company targets cutting $1.5 billion of expenses from its consumer bank by 2020 to reach the financial targets, opening new brick-and-mortar branch locations seems unlikely for now. Michael Corbat, the CEO, at an investors conference in May said, “We're completely focused on the implementation and execution of our national digital banking platform.”With these initiatives, Citigroup anticipates to lower cost of deposit and use technology to reach out to potential new customers.Shares of Citigroup have lost 9.7% so far this year compared wih the industry’s decline of 5.2%.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A lawsuit has been filed against Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) that alleges it of encouraging retailers to include hidden fees in the selling price using the bank’s financing programs. The case has been filed by El Paso, TX-based J Edwards Jewelry Distributing and its president, John Silverman, on behalf of more than 5,000 retailers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Per the complaint, Wells Fargo made retailers advertise that customers could purchase their products with the benefit of interest-free finance programs, whereas, in fact, the prices were already inflated with a double-digit interest charge.Wells Fargo has been accused of violating the U.S. Truth in Lending Act, under which, lenders are supposed to disclose financing charges in detail.

2248,WFC,"Despite the improvement in domestic economy, higher interest rates, tax cuts and the growing optimism regarding lesser regulations, the performance of bank stocks during the first half of 2018 has not been as impressive as expected.Though the first-half performance of banks can be assessed only after the release of second-quarter 2018 results, several macroeconomic headwinds have been hurting the price performance of the industry.During the first half of 2018, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index declined nearly 2.6% and the S&P Banks Select Industry Index witnessed a marginal drop. These compare unfavorably with 1.7% growth of the S&P 500 index.Some of the factors that weighed on investors’ sentiments and possibly led to the dismal performance include the uncertainty relating to the U.S.-China trade war, reduced market volatility (specifically in May and June) and the recent flattening of the yield curve.Is the grim price trend likely to persist in the near term?Let’s take a look at some of the factors that are likely to affect the performance of banking stocks during the second half of 2018.Interest Rates: Given the expectation of two more rate hikes in 2018, banks are likely to record higher interest income, the primary source of revenues. However, if the current scenario with respect to the slope of the yield curve remains intact, the benefit of higher rates will get neutralized to some extent. This is because along with higher rates, a steep yield curve is required for interest income to rise. But since the yield curve is currently toward the flatter side, higher rates will not be enough to support revenue growth for banks.Trade War: If there is a full-blown trade war between the United States and China, business investments will gradually slow down, leading to a decline in the pace of economic growth. And since the performance of bank stocks is mainly tied to the country’s economy, they are expected to bear the brunt of the same.In fact, with the imposition of U.S. tariffs on nearly $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, the signs of a trade war are apparent. Thanks to such tariffs, the rate of unemployment may rise in the future, which will also impede economic growth, thereby indirectly hurting banks’ performance.Notably, if economic growth slows down, it might force the Fed to rethink its plan of rate hikes. The timing as well as the amount of rate hikes may be negatively impacted. Also, with a decline in business investments, the demand for loans may decrease. Thus, a slowdown in the pace of rate hikes combined with lower loan demand is expected to pose a major threat to banks.Digitalization: Banks are of late focusing on digitization of operations, which reflects a customer-friendly move. Banks have been undertaking efforts to align their network according to clients’ needs and upgrading ATMs with latest technology. These initiatives are expected to result in more customer engagement at a lower cost, thereby boosting performance as well as profitability to some extent.Tax Rates: With the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, banks are positioned to benefit from lower tax expenses. Particularly, the new tax legislation will cut effective tax rates for some of the big names in the industry such as JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Moreover, because of lower taxes, companies will have more cash available with them that can be used for growth purposes. With the free cash available, they can engage in buybacks, pay more dividends and also carry out mergers and acquisitions. With the increase in M&As, the related fees will rise thereby boosting revenues for banks’ investment banking divisions.Regulations: For long, there has been growing investor optimism regarding lesser regulations as indicated by Trump. Now, with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, all banks, particularly the smaller ones are expected to gain significantly. The bill, aimed at lessening stringent regulations, will likely lower compliance costs and support banks’ financials.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2249,WFC,"Key bank earnings scheduled for release in the next few weeks will likely provide a better understanding of the sector’s near-term prospects. The banks will focus on the Fed’s decision to increase its benchmark federal funds rate in June for the sixth time since 2015. Moreover, the Fed hinted at one more rate hike in the second half and stated that it is likely to increase rates three times instead of two in 2019.In this context, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), which are scheduled to report on Jul 13 and Jul 16, respectively, assume greater significance. While, Wells Fargo holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Bank of America carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings on Jul 13 include Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceWells Fargo has gained 5.8% in the last three months and outperformed the broader industry that has moved down 2.4% over the same period. In comparison, Bank of America has not only underperformed the broader industry but also Wells Fargo, declining 5.8% over the same time frame.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the industry is clearly undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future.The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.69, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.89. Hence, it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this particular industry.Coming to the two stocks, both are less pricey than both the industry and the S&P 500. However, with a P/B ratio of 1.18, Bank of America is undervalued than competitor Wells Fargo, which has P/B ratio of 1.50.Dividend YieldWells Fargo’s dividend yield over the last year is 2.82%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.18%. With a dividend yield of only 1.72%, Bank of America shareholders earn a comparatively lower dividend yield than both its competitor and the broader industry.Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by interest income. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within the same industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 22.52%, Bank of America is slightly behind the industry average of 22.56%. With respect to profitability, Wells Fargo, with a net margin of 22.86%, is better placed than both Bank of America and the industry.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Bank of America has delivered positive surprises in all the four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 5.8%. On the other hand, Wells Fargo has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 0.7%.When considering Earnings ESP, both Wells Fargo and Bank of America has ESPs of  -0.09% and -4.89%, respectively. Bank of America’s earnings estimates for the current year have remained unchanged over the last seven days, while the same metric for Wells Fargo has increased by 0.2%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Bank of America holds an edge over Wells Fargo when considering valuations and earnings history. However, when considering price performance, net margin and dividend yield, Wells Fargo holds an edge over Bank of America.When we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ ESP and estimate revisions, Wells Fargo is the better stock. What clinches the case in favor of Wells Fargo at this point of time is that it has a better Zacks Rank than Bank of America. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Wells Fargo over Bank of America as both prepare to report earnings in the coming weeks.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2250,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has received the judge’s approval for the settlement of $142 million worth class-action lawsuit related to the 3.5 million fake accounts scandal. However, customers still have scope for filing a claim if they feel they too have been wronged by the bank.The class-action lawsuit was an outcome of the bank’s undue pressure on its employees to achieve extensive sales targets, which led them to open unauthorized savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit from May 2002 to April 2017.The U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria feels that the settlement is an “imperfect solution”, but there was no alternative. He also said, “Class actions are to some degree rough justice, but I do believe this settlement is fair.”The settlement would entertain claims of those clients who have been charged fees on the accounts that were opened without their consent. Also, refunds would be made to customers whose credit scores have been impacted by Wells Fargo’s improper practice and led to higher borrowing costs for them. Lastly, the remaining amount will be distributed equally among the claimants.Wells Fargo has also been ordered to file some additional paper work that would contain an oversight mechanism to ensure the settlement is fully enforced before its attorneys receive their $21 million share.Since the breakout of scandal in September 2016, Wells Fargo made a lot of changes in its staff levels and practices, yet it continued to be involved in a number of legal issues. Recently, the bank settled a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for $480 million.The Sans Francisco-based bank has been paying a number of penalties on this probe since 2016. With this recently announced settlement, the bank would finally get a chance to move ahead of past misconducts.Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the high cost base. Also, the bank’s efforts to better its image among customers and the improving economic backdrop might support its growth in the near term.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 9.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) current-year earnings estimates have been revised 5.1% upward over the last 60 days.

2252,WFC,"With the S&P 500 depreciating around 1.2%, major banks, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), witnessed significant declines in prices on Tuesday. This resulted from the heightening political drama in Italy and Spain, which has spooked investors, creating uproar in global markets. Moreover, the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund (XLF  -  Free Report) — a top bank ETF — declined 3.34%.Particularly, shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman have declined 4.27%, 3.98%, 5.75%, 3.99%, 3.55% and 3.4%, respectively.Worries surrounding Italy’s rising debt yields raised concerns over the stability of Eurozone, dealing a blow to U.S. bank stocks. The rising political uncertainty has put pressure on the European markets and cast a pall over the Euro projects. Therefore, increasing demand for traditional safe assets, like the U.S. debt, has brought down the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, triggering losses for banks in the nation.Further, subdued guidance from some of the Wall Street biggies has also raised investors’ concerns, dragging down banking stocks.Banks’ Outlook At the Deutsche Bank Global Financial Services Conference earlier this week, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking — Daniel Pinto — announced the company’s latest outlook for the second quarter.“Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,” Pinto said. “The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat,” he added.Additionally, though the bank is performing well in rates, commodities and corporate credit business, a quarterly charge of $100 million associated with the tax-oriented investment unit of its fixed income division is expected to be recorded, Pinto added. Moreover, investment banking business momentum is likely to continue.Similarly, Alastair Borthwick, head of BofA’s global corporate banking, came up with the bank’s lending demand outlook for the current year. Per Borthwick, though companies are “more optimistic about the economy,” BofA believes it is still too early to forecast the lending outlook.Strong economy indicates spur in loan growth, but lower U.S. tax rates has already helped earning extra income which refrains the company from providing the lending demand outlook, per Borthwick.Meanwhile, investment bank — Morgan Stanley — tanked on concerns over challenging business conditions in the second quarter, which are affecting its wealth management unit. Notably, this unit generates half of the bank's revenues.Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, noted during the conference that prevalent slower client activity in April and May, as well as March, has dampened Morgan Stanley’s retail transaction revenues.Furthermore, pricing of fee-based accounts is related to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter. At the end of Q1, the market was tumbling, resulting in low pricing of these accounts, thereby negatively impacting Morgan Stanley.ConclusionThe January-March quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes, on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. In addition, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports thwarted the stock market rally in Q1.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appeared that volatility was back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicated higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Nonetheless, banks are skeptical for the second quarter on global market turmoil and uncertainty of markets on the ongoing developments, including easing of regulations.Among the above-mentioned stocks, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BofA, Goldman and JPMorgan currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2253,WFC,"Recent weeks have seen escalating trade hostility between the United States and China. However, starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts expect a strong Q2 earnings season, after solid jobs data spur a welcome shift in market narrative.Energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are likely to record the highest year-over-year earnings growth. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q2 earnings season.Q2 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors look forward to the outset of the Q2 earnings season this week, when bigwigs like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) will be reporting their Q2 numbers. Notably, for the whole of S&P 500, results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are estimated to improve 19% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 24.6% earnings growth on 8.7% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the highest growth in almost seven years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on strong economic data. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a sign that corporates are finding ways to fill positions despite the lack of skilled workers. Such upbeat hiring figures breezed past analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions.Job gains were pretty broad-based, with white-collar jobs leading the way with 50,000 additions. From manufacturers, health-care providers to construction companies, all hired workers, a clear sign of a burgeoning economy.The unemployment rate rose to 4% last month, but for a good reason. The jobless rate went up mostly because of around 600,000 people entering the labor force. This showed that more Americans are searching for jobs as they are easier to find.The U.S. economy, in the meanwhile, is projected to expand in the second quarter at an annual pace of nearly 4% after a 2.2% gain in the first three months of this year, economists say. This would put the economy in a solid position this year to meet or even beat 3% growth in gross domestic product (GDP), one of the primary aims of the government (read more: US GDP to Hit Elusive 3% Annual Growth in 13 Years: 5 Picks).The recent strength in the economy has offset trade war tensions. Needless to say, the United States and China have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s imports, with Beijing accusing the United States for triggering the ‘largest scale trade war’ (read more: Think Small As U.S.-China Trade War Breaks Out! 5 Top Picks).Potential Gainers of Q2The energy sector is poised to record highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 138.4% from the same period last year on 20.3% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A more or less healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily fueling the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q2 earnings expected to rise 54% on 24.1% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q2 earnings poised to be up 45% from the same period last year on 22.5% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 24.5% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand, while manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Q2 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 23.8% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. High profits are also expected from financial segments as well. Total Q2 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 18.4% from the same period last year on 3.8% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth mostly on higher interest rates (read more: Fed Lifts Rates for the Second Time in 2018: Winners & Losers).Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthA very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of stellar earnings growth in Q2.

2254,WFC,"While banks are gearing up for the Q2 earnings season, the Federal Reserve has given clean bills of health to majority of the large American banks. Strong jobs numbers, in fact, raised the possibility of further rate hikes which bodes well for banks.The financial sector at large posted its biggest one-day advance in over three months, with banks leading the way. Let us, thus, focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q2 earnings season. Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Dividend BoostSo far this year, bank stocks have been underperforming the broader S&P 500. But bullish investors are optimistic that banks’ discouraging performance will soon come to an end. Banks are planning to bump up dividends after passing the Fed’s latest round of stress tests with flying colors. This, invariably, will provide a boost to share prices of a select number of U.S. banks. The increasing number of dividends is a reflection of tax cut benefits and stronger capital ratios. In fact, greater capital ratios give banks more room to boost shareholder returns.Nine banks, namely Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), BB&T, Regions Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks and US Bancorp, have already planned to increase dividends.(Source: MarketWatch, Data as of July 2)Banks Are UndervaluedBanks’ poor show this year, by the way, may indicate that they are comparatively undervalued compared to the broader equity market. While the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has shed 0.1% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P is up 4%.Bespoke Investment Group macro strategist George Pearkes has in fact found out by using a mathematical model that bank stock prices by utilizing two-year Treasury yields and investment-grade bond spreads as model inputs, are recently priced at 9% below their fair values. Thus, banks have the potential to climb higher.And why not? Solid June employment data has given the Fed a green signal to continue hiking rates. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a healthy sign showing that corporates are finding ways to fill positions despite the lack of skilled workers. Such hiring figures easily topped analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions (read more: Profit From Strong Job Additions With These 5 Top-Ranked Picks).A move toward higher rates is always favorable for banks. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Fed Gets Slightly More HawkishFed, in the meantime, has raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2% last month. The Fed’s dot plot, in fact, indicated that policy makers predict two additional rate hikes this year for a total of four increases instead of three as planned earlier.By the end of this year, the median forecast for the federal funds rate stands at 2.4%, compared with the March forecast of 2.1%. Beyond this year, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee predicts that it will hike rates three times next year and one more time the following year to propel its benchmark rate up to 3.4% (read more: Fed Lifts Rates for the Second Time in 2018: Winners & Losers).4 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q2 EarningsThe aforesaid factors will surely help banks stay afloat this Q2. For the Finance sector, of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor, total Q2 earnings are expected to grow 18.4% from the same period last year on 3.8% higher revenues. This would follow 25.1% earnings growth in the preceding quarter on 4.8% higher revenues (read more: What's Keeping Bank Stocks Down?). This calls for investing in four banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q2 earnings.

2255,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, banking stocks put up a lackluster show. Though improving U.S. economic data and rising 10-year Treasury bond yields were positives, investors were a bit concerned on the time uncertainty related to the easing of banking regulations and soft loan growth. Nevertheless, strong economy and increasing commodity prices aided a rise in bond yields followed by mortgage rates.Mortgage rates improved to 4.61%, recording a seven-year high since May 2011, as the 10-year Treasury yield hit 3.122%, the highest level since July 2011, on a sell-off recorded in the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increases in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Further, litigations and probes pertaining to banks’ past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track to work to resolve such issues and avoid lengthy litigations. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending May 11, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is in trouble again as its employees have been accused this time for modifying or adding false information related to the bank’s corporate customers, without bringing to their notice, in order to meet a regulatory deadline. Despite strict regulatory scrutiny and promises made by the bank to improve internal controls, disclosures of such misconducts have shattered the bank’s image.Per the report, the scandal took place between late 2017 and the first few months of 2018. Employees at its Wholesale Banking segment have added or changed some personal information such as birth dates, social security numbers and addresses for clients it dealt with during that period. Wells Fargo has been facing a Jun 30 deadline to comply with a regulatory order related to anti-money laundering controls. In an internal investigation, Wells Fargo became aware of these misdoings. The matter has been brought up with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who is currently investigating the matter.2. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) has been fined $7.3 million by Hong Kong’s securities regulator. The Securities and Futures Commission said that the bank had failed to discharge its duties of conducting proper due diligence as a sponsor for China-based Real Gold Mining Ltd.’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2009.The mining company has been banned from trading since 2011, after irregularities were discovered in its accounting system. The SFC noted that the bank “failed to conduct adequate and reasonable due diligence on Real Gold’s customers and properly supervise its staff when carrying out the sponsor work on Real Gold’s listing application.”3. With an aim to provide access to its sophisticated alternative investment strategies to a broader client base, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is reducing the minimum requirement needed to participate in various alternative investment strategies that the company’s asset-management arm offers. The new limit has been set at $100,000, down from the previous requirement of $10 million. This reduction will expand access to certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies to the masses, which was earlier restricted only to the institutions and the ultra-rich.For this, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the asset-management arm of the bank has agreed to use the technology of iCapital Network Inc. — a financial technology platform. Per the agreement, J.P. Morgan Asset Management will partner with iCapital so that high net worth investors and their advisors can access certain J.P.

2256,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has landed in trouble again thanks to its employees, who reportedly modified or added false information related to corporate customers, without their knowledge, in order to meet a regulatory deadline. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Despite strict regulatory scrutiny and promises made by Wells Fargo to improve internal controls, disclosure of such misconducts continues to shake investors’ confidence in the stock. Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 1.5% in yesterday’s trading session. Per the report, the scandal happened between late 2017 and first few months of 2018. Employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information such as birth dates, social security numbers and addresses of clients during that period.Citing people familiar with the matter, Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo has been facing a Jun 30 deadline to comply with a regulatory order related to anti-money laundering controls.  In an internal investigation, Wells Fargo became aware of these misdoings. The matter is currently under investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.A spokeswoman at Wells Fargo said, ""This matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.""Last week, Wells Fargo had launched an ad-campaign — Re-Established — with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices.However, findings of these sort continue to test regulators tolerance toward Wells Fargo’s wrongdoings. In its Investors’ Day held on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the regulatory cap on its assets till the first part of 2019. This disclosure might extend that to an even longer time.Also, the company’s bottom-line remains under pressure due to unstable revenues. However, the bank has an impressive cost-control program underway, which might help it deal with the legal costs and improve financials.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 2.1% in the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 20.9%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2257,WFC,"Move aside traditional bankers, Humanoid Robots are here!As customers embrace new technology, banks are also trying to meet client expectations by digitizing their operations with the help of latest technology including artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual assistance.  So, for the first time in the United States, HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report) has unveiled seven humanoid robots — Pepper — at its flagship Fifth Avenue branch in New York. Developed by SoftBank Robotics Group, the humanoid robots are expected to reduce wait time at branches, assist and encourage customers to use available technical tools and platforms, and make clients aware of HSBC products and services. All these efforts are expected to draw more business.If the robots are able to enhance customer experience, HSBC will roll these out to its 228 U.S. branches. Further, the bank intends to gradually increase Pepper’s capabilities and allow customers to complete product applications on its tablets. Notably, the company has spent nearly $131 million on robots and other technology upgrades.Pablo Sanchez, regional head of retail banking and wealth management segment for HSBC in the U.S. and Canada, said, “We’re focused on developing the ‘branch of the future,’ and our use of Pepper will streamline branch operations and delight our customers, allowing bank staff to have deeper, more high-value customer engagements.”HSBC is not the only bank using AI to interact with customers.

2260,WFC,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains dives into the potential future of Gatorade rival BodyArmor, before he discusses why fast-fashion giant Uniqlo decided to spend $300 million to lure Roger Federer away from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). The episode then ends with a fun and quick dive into the world of publicly traded soccer teams amid all the Cristiano Ronaldo transfer speculation.Sports drink upstart BodyArmor was launched in 2011 by Mike Repole, who sold Vitaminwater to Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for $4.1 billion back in 2007. Today the company has gathered a slew of young stars, including James Harden, to pitch BodyArmor’s “healthier” sports drink in an attempt to try to shake up a market dominated by Pepsico’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s Powerade.There is speculation that BodyArmor, which expects to see its sales hit $400 million next year, could get purchased. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group  currently holds a roughly 15% equity stake in the company and has carried BodyArmor as an allied brand since 2013. However, with Keurig's $18.7 billion deal to buy DPS set to close on Monday, July 9—the merged company is expected to trade under the ticker KDP starting on Tuesday, July 10—BodyArmor’s future is more uncertain.One Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) analyst suggested that there is a good chance that Keurig Dr. Pepper will move on from its current minority stakes. The thought is that the relatively stagnant Coca-Cola might jump in and scoop up BodyArmor amid the quickly changing beverage market.The episode then shifts to why Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo—which is owned by Tokyo conglomerate Fast Retailing —signed Swiss tennis star Roger Federer to a 10-year, $300 million deal. Uniqlo wants to try to capitalize on the current sportswear and athleisure push, popularized by Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report), and others. And although he might not be very famous in the U.S., ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) recently named Federer the 5th most famous athlete on the planet.Full-Court Finance closes with a look at the world of publicly traded soccer teams, after shares of Juventus JVTSF—a massively popular team based in Turin, Italy—skyrocketed in recent days on the back of speculation that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo might be headed to the club almost a decade after he left another publicly traded soccer powerhouse, Manchester United plc (MANU  -  Free Report).As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

2261,WFC,"As part of Fifth Third Bancorp’s (FITB  -  Free Report) re-evaluation of the branch network, the banking giant is exploring the cities which are underserved, and taking steps to open new branches. Per a bizjournals article, the bank's CEO, Greg D. Carmichael, and Florida regional president — David Call — have planned to open new branches in the Tampa Bay region, in a bid to expand footprint in various key markets.Notably, Fifth Third, one of the largest banks of the United States, has filed plans with regulators for the opening of 15 new branches. These include five to be opened in Florida, with two in Sarasota, and one each in Orlando, Bonita Springs and Jacksonville.Reasons for Opening New Branches""This has been a great market for us,"" Carmichael noted about the Florida and the Tampa Bay area. ""In 2019, we'll be more aggressive,"" he further added.The decision of opening new branches is commensurate with the area’s increasing population, expected growth, and market needs as per small business and commercial customers.""As the population continues to grow and more businesses move to Florida, we want to make sure we are appropriately sized,"" Carmichael stated. It indicates the bank’s aim to increase commercial and industrial lending, along with the strong commercial real estate market in the state. On the other side, for consumers, the issuance of credit cards and other loans rises.Per Call, the business lending climate in overall Florida, particularly Tampa, is very strong, with more than $7 billion in assets. The bank has various options of providing banking and wealth-management services for expansion of businesses to proprietor and middle-market companies in such regions.If there are any factors that make companies wary of borrowing now, when the U.S. economy is strong and markets are reaching new highs, it is uncertainty, Carmichael mentioned. ""But, there are more upsides and positives than negatives,"" he said. ""We believe the tax reform is very beneficial to corporate America and to business in particular. The rate environment is still good for CapEx expenditures,” noted the bank’s CEO.Change to DigitizationIn this era of digitalization, Fifth Third’s customers are being able to withdraw money using its mobile banking app, instead of a physical card. Further, the bank has officially initiated cardless technology at more than 2,500 ATMs across 10 states. This advanced technology will enable customers to use ATMs without physical debit cards.""Over 50 percent of our customer base is millennials,"" Carmichael mentioned further. As a result, ""60 percent of all our banking happens in digital channels,"" he said. “Five years ago, it was only 20 percent digital. That shift in how banking is done ""allows our customers to bank the most convenient and efficient ways,"" he added.Among others, Charlotte-based Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) has also incorporated cardless technology into its ATMs. In 2016, this Wall Street biggie rolled out 8,000 cardless ATMs. Later, the bank added 500 ATMs. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also integrated cardless technology into its 13,000 ATMs, in 2017. Apart from BofA and Wells Fargo, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is also headed toward rolling out cardless ATMs.ConclusionCustomers have been increasingly using smart phones for financial transactions. Furthermore, banks have been witnessing tremendous growth in the number of active mobile users. Hence, in order to capitalize on this trend, these firms are now rolling out the cardless ATM technology. In addition, this is in sync with the industry-wide focus on right sizing branch networks and enhancing customer satisfaction. Nevertheless, expansion of footprint by opening new branches in underserved areas is expected to be a catalyst for banks.Introduction of digital technology remains cost effective for banks. Additionally, increasing competition from financial technology firms (FinTech) has been driving banks to digitize their operations.Therefore, banks are trying all possible ways to enhance customer experience, reduce expenses and improve profitability.Currently, Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Fifth Third gained 14.5% over the last six months, outperforming 3.1% growth recorded by the industry.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2262,WFC,"Major banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results over the last five trading days managed to record bottom-line improvement, driven by rising rates, stable asset quality and lower taxes. Apart from the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results reflected a slight improvement in lending activities.However, higher expenses and slowdown in mortgage banking business continued to be major headwinds. Also, it seems that the guidance provided by management didn’t meet investors expectations. Thus, the performance of banks over the last five trading sessions was bearish.Apart from first-quarter earnings releases, a huge penalty for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines. The bank’s business misconducts have even led to several probes into its business activities.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 20, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. SunTrust’s (STI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.29 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Results were primarily driven by rise in net interest income, lower expenses as well as lower provisions. However, decline in non-interest income hurt results to some extent. (Read more: SunTrust Beats on Q1 Earnings as Expenses Decline)2. Riding on high revenues, Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) recorded an impressive earnings surprise of 12.9% in first-quarter 2018. Reported earnings of 35 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Easing margin pressure and higher revenues benefited the results.

Fifth Third Bancorp’s (FITB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.

Capital One’s (COF  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34. Results benefited from rise in revenues, a decline in provision for credit losses and easing margin pressure. Yet, an increase in expenses was the undermining factor. (Read More: Capital One Beats on Q1 Earnings as Revenues Improve)5. Business misconducts continue to haunt Wells Fargo. The bank has been penalized for alleged customer abuses at its mortgage and auto lending businesses. The company agreed to pay $1 billion (in total) to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Both the regulators fined Wells Fargo for wrongly charging fees to borrowers who wanted to lock in an interest rate on a pending mortgage loan and for sticking auto loan clients with insurance policies they didn't want or require. Notably, the company admitted that tens of thousands of its customers who could not afford the combined auto loan and extra insurance payment fell behind on their payments and had their cars repossessed.Nevertheless, these allegations are separate from the bank’s sales practice scandal that erupted in September 2016.As a result of this huge fine, Wells Fargo adjusted its first-quarter 2018 earnings by an additional $800 million accrual. This lowered the company’s first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per to $4.7 billion or 96 cents per share.Nevertheless, this isn’t the end of litigations/probes for Wells Fargo. The company’s wealth management business, currency trading operation and retirement-plan services unit are reportedly under investigation by several regulators.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week6 monthsJPM-1.2%9.3%BAC-0.6%9.3%WFC-0.2%-4.5%C-1.2%-5.5%COF-6.5%0.0%USB0.7%-5.4%PNC1.1%6.8%In the last five trading sessions, PNC Financial was the major gainer, with its shares gaining 1.1%.

2263,WFC,"After an exponential rise throughout 2017, the U.S. stock markets have been witnessing turmoil since February 2018. Markets remain highly unstable with rapid ascent being observed one week, followed by a sharp decline the very next week.  Investors remain skeptical about the U.S. mid-term elections and high expectations from first-quarter earnings.One of the easiest ways for any company to raise its shareholders’ wealth is to hike dividend rate. Investment in high-dividend paying stocks, over a reasonable time period, is likely to bring good returns, especially when the market is plagued with severe volatility. At this stage, investors should choose stocks which promise strong dividend yield and carry a favorable Zacks Rank to capitalize on future growth.Political Issues Loom Large With mid-term elections in the United States imminent, several opinion polls have predicted that Democrats are likely to get majority in the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate. However, a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.Trump administration is deeply concerned about national security and China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.These concerns compelled the government to adopt and impose protectionist policies. However, Trump’s strategy might not succeed with a majority of Democrats in the House. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee is drafting a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by President Trump. Mueller is investigating into whether Trump’s campaign team colluded with Russia in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.Earnings Expectations SkyrocketFirst-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. In fact, investors have pinned high hopes on first-quarter 2018 earnings. These massive expectations are often resulting in day-to-day market volatility.On Apr 15, share price of three major banks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report) shed 2.7%, 1.6% and 3.4%, respectively. These banking behemoths lost significantly despite reporting better-than-expected first quarter results.The earnings and revenue growth rates along with the proportion of positive earnings surprises are tracking materially above historical periods. With expectations too high, it is possible that actual results may not live up to expectations, which will weigh on the sector’s stock market performance in the coming days.

2264,WFC,"After hitting a record high last week, the Nasdaq hit a fresh peak on Jun 20. Investors feel tech stocks can continue to chalk up gains even as trade relations between the United States and China worsen. This is because they are less susceptible to tariffs than industrials. Also, China’s ability to act against U.S. tech companies may be limited by its efforts to build its own tech industry.Investors also remain hopeful that negotiations can reduce the impact of tariffs.  Germany’s decision to do away with car tariffs is an example of how trade disputes can be settled amicably. With the economy in fine fettle and no signs of a bubble in sight, investing in tech stocks still looks like a profitable option. Tech Stocks Surge Higher, Germany Dials Down TensionsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Jun 20 to hit a new all-time high, boosted primarily by Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) which also hit record levels. Shares of Facebook and Netflix gained 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively.Netflix’s surge was attributable to Disney’s revised offer for Fox’s entertainment business. Subsequently, other media majors like Netflix and Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) gained with investors speculating that more such deals are around the corner.Meanwhile, heads of BMW (BAMXF  -  Free Report), Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) and Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report) met the U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to The Wall Street Journal. During the meeting, they floated the idea of abolishing car tariffs between the United States and the EU. This development has dialed down trade tensions and indicates that negotiations could reduce the impact of tariffs.Can Tech Stocks Withstand Tariff Shocks?Investors increasingly feel that tech stocks are not as susceptible to tariffs as say home appliance markets or industrial companies. According to Sameer Samana, a strategist at Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) Investment Institute, losses suffered by U.S. markets due to trade tensions are largely temporary. Ultimately, investors choose to focus on the strong performance of the domestic and global economies.Samana stresses that tech companies have been the leading gainers during market recoveries from losses attributable to trade-related issues. This is primarily because of their strong earnings performances. Further, China’ ability to impose tariffs on U.S. tech companies may be limited even as its attempts to build up its own tech industry.Our ChoicesTech stocks have chalked up strong gains despite the persistence of trade tensions. Investors feel that technology may be not be as vulnerable to tariffs as other sectors, such as industrials. Further, China may not be able to raise tariffs on tech companies beyond a point as its attempts to develop its own tech sector.Investing in tech stocks, which make up the Nasdaq, looks like a smart option at this time. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.Micron has a VGM Score of A.

2265,WFC,"Finance sector earnings were up +25% in 2018 Q1 and the expectation is that growth in the Q2 earnings season, which JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) kick-off with their results on Friday July 13th, will likely be as good. But none of that shows up in the group’s stock market performance, with bank stocks one of the weakest performers in the market.Bank stocks are down -5.7% this year, underperforming the broader market’s +2.6% gain and the Finance sector’s -4.8% decline. The group never got its mojo back after losing ground at the start of February, but continued to lead the S&P 500 through mid-March meaningfully diverging from the broader index around mid-May. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance comparison of the Zacks Major Banks industry and the S&P 500 index.The biggest reason for this recent underperformance is the interest rate uncertainty, which has forced yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond to generally move sideways and down after peaking at 3.11% in mid-May. On top of this lack of follow through in long-term yields, shorter maturity yields have been steadily going up, primarily in response to the well telegraphed Fed moves and trajectory. As a result, the yield spread between shorter maturity treasury bonds and longer maturity instruments has been steadily coming down and currently remains at its lowest level in a very long time. The chart below shows the yield spread between 2- and 10-year treasury bonds over the past year (currently at 30 basis points, as of Tuesday, July 3rd).The reason we are talking about treasury yields and interest rates in a discussion about bank earnings is that Interest rates act like oxygen for banks. The low interest rates of the last few years, resulting from a deliberate Fed policy, had put a lid on banks’ earnings power. Net interest margin, the difference between what banks pay their depositors and what they charge lenders, has been flat to down for the last few years. With revenue growth hard to come by as a result of this backdrop, banks were forced to maintain profitability by squeezing expenses out of their operations.The above chart showing yield spread between 2- and 10-treasury bonds goes to the core of the market’s dilemma about bank stocks and net interest margins and bank profitability are a function of this yield spread. The fear in the market is that banks wouldn’t benefit from Fed tightening as long-term rates remain subdued even as short-term rates have been going up.This phenomenon, generally referred to as a ‘flattening of the yield curve’, is the reason why everyone in the market is so sour on bank stocks at present. I don’t agree with this view and see banks as one of a few areas in the market that represent genuine value. But this note isn’t about my investment outlook for banks, but rather the group’s earnings picture that starts getting clearer with Friday’s releases from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. On a related note, we hold two of these three stocks in the Zacks Focus List portfolio.What Are Banks Expected to Report in Q2?Of the three major banks reporting on Friday, July 13th, Citigroup earnings are expected to be up +4.6% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues while JPMorgan’s Q2 earnings and revenues are expected to be up +9.1% and +8.6%, respectively. Earnings and revenues for Wells Fargo, which is slowly coming out of the dog house, are expected to be down -5.9% and -2.8% from the same period last year, respectively.Looking at the group in the aggregate, results from capital markets and investment banking should be flat from the year-earlier level, with modest loan growth and some net interest margin gains complementing continued cost controls. Key points of interest on the conference calls will be trends in loan portfolios which have failed to live up to expectations and management’s plans on capital returns that recently got the Fed’s nod in the latest Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) aka Fed Stress Tests. For the Finance sector as a whole, of which the Major Banks industry account for roughly 45% of total earnings, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.4% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. This would follow +25.1% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +4.8% higher revenues.The table below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings expectations in the context of what was actually reported in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the following four periods at the medium-industry level.As you can see in the above chart, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in the back half of the year.Overall Expectations for 2018 Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.7%, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.When market commentators talk about earnings growth peak, it is the growth comparison in this chart they are referring to. Looking at this chart, it is obvious that growth has peaked already, with the pace decelerating going forward.We should keep in mind however that actual results typically come in better than expected, with actuals exceeding estimates in the 3% to 5% range. This means that the 19% growth pace currently expected in Q2 will likely be closer to the 2018 Q1 tally when all is said and done.  The overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while dollar earnings aren’t expected to ‘peak’ till the last quarter of 2018.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>>Here is a list of the 22 companies including 7 S&P 500 and reporting this week. Company Ticker Current Qtr Year-Ago Qtr Last EPS Surprise % Report Day Time HELEN OF TROYHELE1.331.2816.67%MondayBTOPEPSICO INCPEP1.511.54.35%TuesdayBTOAAR CORPAIR0.520.442.08%TuesdayAMCEXFO INCEXFO-0.06-0.03-75.00%TuesdayAMCSARATOGA INVESTSAR0.540.613.21%TuesdayAMCWD 40 COWDFC1.041.0210.53%TuesdayAMCSIMULATION PLUSSLP0.120.130.00%TuesdayAMCVOXX INTL CPVOXX-0.02-0.13740.00%TuesdayAMCFASTENALFAST0.660.520.00%WednesdayBTOMSC INDL DIRECTMSM1.391.093.08%WednesdayBTOANGIODYNAMICSANGO0.210.1925.00%WednesdayBTOBANK OF OZARKSOZRK0.890.733.53%WednesdayAMCDELTA AIR LINESDAL1.751.641.37%ThursdayBTOCOMMERCE BANCSHCBSH0.890.7115.00%ThursdayBTOPEAK RESORTSSKIS0.620.529.26%ThursdayBTONATL BEVERAGEFIZZ0.890.63N/AThursdayBTOASPEN GROUP INCASPU-0.11-0.0726.67%ThursdayAMCPNC FINL SVC CPPNC2.582.10.41%FridayBTOWELLS FARGO-NEWWFC1.121.074.67%FridayBTOCITIGROUP INCC1.571.274.35%FridayBTOJPMORGAN CHASEJPM2.241.823.95%FridayBTOFIRST REP BK SFFRC1.161.066.60%FridayBTO

2266,WFC,"The Fed will be announcing the results of bank stress tests on Jun 21 and results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review (""CCAR"") on Jun 28. The tests, which are an annual affair and a must for banks since the 2008 financial meltdown, are designed to ensure that they are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn. Looking back, President Donald Trump in May signed the biggest rollback of bank regulations since the global economic downturn into law.The law has been designed to relax rules for all but the largest banks. The move is likely to significantly benefit community banks. And apart from suburban and rural banks, the new law is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. Bank stocks have been performing well ever since Trump came to power and with Fed having already made two rate hikes this year, banks are likely to finally get benefited.New Stress Test to Benefit BanksStress tests have been in place since 2008 and are considered one of the most important measures to assess the ability of banks to withstand an economic crisis. However, in May, Trump signed the biggest rollback of financial regulations since the Dodd-Frank Act came to effect in 2010. The new law has raised the assets threshold for banks that are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.This certainly has freed small banks from the burden of being considered too big to fail. Thus the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer need to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. Moreover, the new law cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks.The largest banks on the other hand will have to pass a stricter stress test. However, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests.Moreover, six foreign banks, namely Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), BNP Paribas SA (BNPQY  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report), Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG, have been included this year for the first time that will have to undergo the stress test.Banks to Pay Record DividendsDespite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks are expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders in the United States are estimated to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, almost 25% more than last year.Among these, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report) are leading the race. Per a Bloomberg report, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America is expected to pay out more than 100% of their profits over the next four quarters. These banks are likely to be followed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). JP Morgan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.This implies that the largest commercial banks are most likely to pass the Fed’s stress test. Moreover, the Fed too thinks that the banking sector has successfully entered the next stage of its recovery since the financial crisis. Moreover, the Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year, which has resulted banks in charging their customers more, thus making their financial position even better.Summing UpThe new law certainly has made things easier for small commercial banks. On the other hand, the large banks are likely to announce record payouts to their shareholders for the first time since the economic crisis, which proves that they are in a position to comfortably pass the stress test.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2267,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has been making plans to merge the Wealth Brokerage Services and Private Client Group, as both the divisions are dedicated to serving high-end customers. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The move is aimed at improving efficiency of the wealth management segment by streamlining operations. Details of the restructuring will likely be disclosed later this week, by Jon Weiss, the lead of wealth and investment management unit, at an internal meeting to be held in town hall.In its latest quarterly filing, Wells Fargo had mentioned that its investment management segment was still undergoing a review to assess whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers.

As a result, the yield spread between shorter maturity treasury bonds and longer maturity instruments has been steadily coming down and currently remains at its lowest level in a very long time. The chart below shows the yield spread between 2- and 10-year treasury bonds over the past year (currently at 30 basis points, as of Tuesday, July 3rd).The reason we are talking about treasury yields and interest rates in a discussion about bank earnings is that Interest rates act like oxygen for banks. The low interest rates of the last few years, resulting from a deliberate Fed policy, had put a lid on banks’ earnings power. Net interest margin, the difference between what banks pay their depositors and what they charge lenders, has been flat to down for the last few years. With revenue growth hard to come by as a result of this backdrop, banks were forced to maintain profitability by squeezing expenses out of their operations.The above chart showing yield spread between 2- and 10-treasury bonds goes to the core of the market’s dilemma about bank stocks and net interest margins and bank profitability are a function of this yield spread. The fear in the market is that banks wouldn’t benefit from Fed tightening as long-term rates remain subdued even as short-term rates have been going up.This phenomenon, generally referred to as a ‘flattening of the yield curve’, is the reason why everyone in the market is so sour on bank stocks at present. I don’t agree with this view and see banks as one of a few areas in the market that represent genuine value. But this note isn’t about my investment outlook for banks, but rather the group’s earnings picture that starts getting clearer with Friday’s releases from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. On a related note, we hold two of these three stocks in the Zacks Focus List portfolio.What Are Banks Expected to Report in Q2?Of the three major banks reporting on Friday, July 13th, Citigroup earnings are expected to be up +4.6% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues while JPMorgan’s Q2 earnings and revenues are expected to be up +9.1% and +8.6%, respectively. Earnings and revenues for Wells Fargo, which is slowly coming out of the dog house, are expected to be down -5.9% and -2.8% from the same period last year, respectively.Looking at the group in the aggregate, results from capital markets and investment banking should be flat from the year-earlier level, with modest loan growth and some net interest margin gains complementing continued cost controls. Key points of interest on the conference calls will be trends in loan portfolios which have failed to live up to expectations and management’s plans on capital returns that recently got the Fed’s nod in the latest Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) aka Fed Stress Tests. For the Finance sector as a whole, of which the Major Banks industry account for roughly 45% of total earnings, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.4% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. This would follow +25.1% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +4.8% higher revenues.The table below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings expectations in the context of what was actually reported in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the following four periods at the medium-industry level.As you can see in the above chart, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in the back half of the year.Overall Expectations for 2018 Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.7%, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.When market commentators talk about earnings growth peak, it is the growth comparison in this chart they are referring to. Looking at this chart, it is obvious that growth has peaked already, with the pace decelerating going forward.We should keep in mind however that actual results typically come in better than expected, with actuals exceeding estimates in the 3% to 5% range. This means that the 19% growth pace currently expected in Q2 will likely be closer to the 2018 Q1 tally when all is said and done.  The overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while dollar earnings aren’t expected to ‘peak’ till the last quarter of 2018.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>>Here is a list of the 22 companies including 7 S&P 500 and reporting this week. Company Ticker Current Qtr Year-Ago Qtr Last EPS Surprise % Report Day Time HELEN OF TROYHELE1.331.2816.67%MondayBTOPEPSICO INCPEP1.511.54.35%TuesdayBTOAAR CORPAIR0.520.442.08%TuesdayAMCEXFO INCEXFO-0.06-0.03-75.00%TuesdayAMCSARATOGA INVESTSAR0.540.613.21%TuesdayAMCWD 40 COWDFC1.041.0210.53%TuesdayAMCSIMULATION PLUSSLP0.120.130.00%TuesdayAMCVOXX INTL CPVOXX-0.02-0.13740.00%TuesdayAMCFASTENALFAST0.660.520.00%WednesdayBTOMSC INDL DIRECTMSM1.391.093.08%WednesdayBTOANGIODYNAMICSANGO0.210.1925.00%WednesdayBTOBANK OF OZARKSOZRK0.890.733.53%WednesdayAMCDELTA AIR LINESDAL1.751.641.37%ThursdayBTOCOMMERCE BANCSHCBSH0.890.7115.00%ThursdayBTOPEAK RESORTSSKIS0.620.529.26%ThursdayBTONATL BEVERAGEFIZZ0.890.63N/AThursdayBTOASPEN GROUP INCASPU-0.11-0.0726.67%ThursdayAMCPNC FINL SVC CPPNC2.582.10.41%FridayBTOWELLS FARGO-NEWWFC1.121.074.67%FridayBTOCITIGROUP INCC1.571.274.35%FridayBTOJPMORGAN CHASEJPM2.241.823.95%FridayBTOFIRST REP BK SFFRC1.161.066.60%FridayBTO

2271,WFC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WFC due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Wells Fargo Q1 Earnings Beat, Low Provisions RecordedWells Fargo recorded positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings of $1.12 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Moreover, results improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03.Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.Lower provisions and higher interest income aided results. However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.7 billion. However, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $22.3 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking segment’s total quarterly revenues increased slightly, while Wholesale Banking revenues were down around 3.9%, and revenues for the Wealth and Investment Management unit edged down moderately.Loans, Non-Interest & Interest Income Fall, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.2 billion, down 1% year over year. Increased interest income from debt securities, loans held for sale, loans, equity securities, along with higher other interest income, were mostly offset by higher interest expense. Further, net interest margin contracted 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.84%.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 2% year over year, primarily due to fall in almost all components of income, partly offset by net gains from equity securities and higher other income.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans were $947.3 billion, down around 1.2% year over year. Reduction in consumer as well as commercial loan portfolio was recorded. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, down 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $14.2 billion, up 3% from the year-earlier quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from a rise in salaries and commission, and incentive compensation, along with elevated other expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reduction of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 64.9% came in above the 62% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the reported quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $11.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, down 8.1% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $191 million, plummeting 68.4% year over year. Net charge-offs were $741 million or 0.32% of average loans in the first quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter’s net charge-offs of $805 million (0.34%). Non-performing assets were down 22.4% to $8.3 billion in the quarter under review from $10.7 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the recently-reported quarter, the company returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $153.1 billion from $148.5 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 12% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.2% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $37.33 from $35.67 recorded in the comparable period last year.OutlookAccording to management, growth in net interest income for 2018 will depend on a variety of factors, including the level and of slope of the yield curve, as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.During the extended period of low interest rates since the fixed commercial loan swaps entered into, they generated incremental net income of about $3 billion. While the elimination of these swaps will reduce interest income in 2018, it has increased the bank’s asset sensitivity to be slightly above the middle of previously provided guidance of 5-15 bps for a 100-basis-point parallel shift in the yield curve and is expected to improve interest income in future periods as interest rates increase.Given the current market pricing trends, management expects production margin to decline further in 2Q18.Management currently projects the full-year 2018 effective income tax rate to be approximately 19%.Management expects credit card balances to grow due to focus on digital channels and customer engagement.Based on trends in customer behaviour, Wells Fargo accelerated branch closures in 2016 and closed 84 branches mostly in the second half of the year. Furthermore, management recorded increased pace of branch closures and exceeded 200 branches in 2017, and expects closures at the level of 300 in 2018.Additionally, on technology advancement and other factors, total branch network is expected to decline to around 5,000 by the end of 2020. Wells Fargo is also reducing properties and other businesses, including standalone mortgage locations which stand by more than 10% in 2017, and transitioning operational activities in auto business from 57 regional banking centers into three larger regional sites. The consolidation is likely to be completed in the first half of 2018.The bank is on track to achieve the targeted $4 billion of expense reductions. An initial $2 billion of targeted expense savings is expected by year-end 2018, supporting the company’s ongoing investment in the businesses, which includes a number of key areas, such as enhancing the compliance and risk management capability, building a better bank and strengthening core infrastructure.Management estimates the additional $2-billion targeted annual expense reductions by the end of 2019 to trickle down to the bottom line and be fully recognized in 2020. These projected savings do not include the completion of core deposit intangible amortization expense at the end of 2018, which will amount to $769 million in full-year 2018, and also does not include completion of the FDIC special assessment which is anticipated by the end of 2018. Additionally, expense savings due to business divestitures are excluded.Management anticipates full-year 2018 total expenses of $53.5-$54.5 billion. This expectation includes approximately $600 million of operating losses in 2018, and excludes any outside litigation and remediation accruals or penalties.The seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected to drop in 2Q18, though salary expense is likely to flare up.Further, quarterly efficiency ratio above 59% is estimated by the end of 2018, excluding any outside litigation accruals.After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized since the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of collection and funding activities, the bank is positioned to start increasing originations over time, and currently expects the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.Management expects residential mortgage originations to increase in 2Q18, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to eight lower.Wells Fargo & Company Price and Consensus  Wells Fargo & Company Price and Consensus | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, WFC has a poor Growth Score of F and a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

2272,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was bullish. Strong economic growth, desired inflation and a steady labor market boosted investors’ confidence. Moreover, the recent upswing in oil prices is expected to improve near-term inflation outlook, thereby smoothing the path to rise in interest rates.Mortgage rates also slightly improved to 4.55%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increase in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Further, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts persisted in the last five trading days.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Apr 27, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Legal hassles continue for major banks. Recently, per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) has agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018.Per the filing, “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018. (Read more: Wells Fargo Resolves Sales Scam-Related Suit, To Pay $480M)2. During its Investors’ Day presentation held this week, Wells Fargo came out with impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets. The bank also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80%, from 55-75% it had set in 2016. However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates. The bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Considering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank stated that it expects the restriction’s impact on its after tax net income to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that modest growth in loans and deposits balance helped reduce the impact to about $100 million.3. As part of its efforts to do away with less profitable businesses, Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) will sell roughly $17 billion of first and second lien mortgages to DLJ Mortgage Capital Inc., a subsidiary of Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report). The deal, expected to close later this quarter, is expected to result in one-time gain for Capital One. (Read more: Capital One to Sell $17B of Mortgages & Resume Share Buyback)4. As part of its efforts to expand into newer markets, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) wants to set up a joint-venture brokerage in China. For this, the company is seeking approval from the securities regulator in the country. Gao Li, a spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, recently stated that J.P. Morgan Broking (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of JPMorgan submitted an application to acquire 51% stake in a Chinese securities venture. The application will be reviewed by the regulator efficiently, Li said.This move by the bank comes after China, in April, pledged to open its financial markets and hence released guidelines giving permission to foreign companies to own a maximum of 51% of their local securities joint ventures. Notably, the country is expected to remove all ownership limits for foreign companies after three years.5. KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a 14.3% hike in the quarterly common stock dividend.

2273,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) closed 1.7% higher yesterday, reflecting investors’ bullish stance on the bank’s impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets.During its Investors’ Day presentation held on May 10, Wells Fargo also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80% from 55-75% it had set in 2016.However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Let’s discuss the two keys takeaways of the presentation in details below.Impressive Cost-Savings PlanThe Sans Francisco-based bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Further, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry said that expenses for 2020 might be between $50 billion and $51 billion along with revenues consistent with 2017. However, he cautioned that it was not a formal projection and that the bank's will remain committed to improving revenues.Such measures will help the bank combat the persistent legal expenses. Also, this move might enable it to invest in productive areas.Lesser Impact on Earnings From Asset Cap, Time Period Might ExtendConsidering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank said that it expects the restriction’s impact on its net income after tax to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that slow growth in loans and deposits balance helped in reducing the impact to about $100 million.Also, after considering the restrictions, the bank was looking forward to continue building its balance sheet after a third-party review of its plans, to improve controls and governance, to be held in September 2018.However, on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the cap till the first part of 2019, in order to better enforce the plans to improve operations.Our ViewpointWells Fargo’s CEO, Tim Sloan, has launched a new advertising campaign with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices. On the other hand, it continues to settle past misconducts and accept penalties.It is uncertain when the bank will be able to get past the legal hassles and strict regulatory scrutiny. Further, unstable revenues remain another key concern for Wells Fargo. However, its expense control initiative might allow some room to deal with the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 3.1% over the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 18%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2274,WFC,"Oil price has zoomed to the highest levels in more than three and a half years buoyed by potential export disruptions in Iran and falling production in Venezuela. Additionally, the historic output cut deal by OPEC, Russia and other producers to curb production is paying off, paving the way for a rebalancing of the oil market despite rising U.S. production.The global benchmark Brent crude and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI  -  Free Report) rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively. The bullish trend is likely to continue given that Trump has decided to restore sanctions on Iran, which will disrupt oil supplies in the major Middle East oil producer Iran, resulting in further tightening of the global glut.Additionally, seasonality will continue to support a price surge in the coming months. This is because demand generally picks up in a summer driving season (which starts with Memorial Day at the end of May and lasts until Labor Day in September), leading to higher prices.A BlessingHigher oil price is big boon to energy stocks, especially producers and explorers, which get most of their revenues from selling the crude that they extract. This is because the cost of oil production or extraction remains low as companies look to lock in supply contracts at higher prices. The gap between production cost and selling price keeps on rising when oil price surges even higher, leading to fat profit margins and thus a spike in company’s share price.As a result, the S&P Energy Index has gained 13.6% so far this quarter, easily outperforming the other sector. The Zacks Oil and Energy sector has gained 11% over the past month with some of the outperforming stocks including EP Energy Corporation EPE, Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Rex Energy Corporation , Transglobe Energy Corp (TGA  -  Free Report), Penn Virginia Corporation PVAC, and W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report). All these have soared more than 50% in a month.The optimism in the energy sector has pushed up gains from Wall Street, which was struggling amid a series of woes. In fact, the major broad indices have turned green from a year-to-date look with the surge in oil prices.Further, rising oil prices coupled with rising interest rates are acting as catalysts to the financial sector given that most banks are highly exposed to the energy space. This is because rising oil price alleviates the default risks for banks’ exposure to oil and gas companies, and creates additional credit demand that could result in improving credit quality. In particular, big banks like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) could be the largest beneficiaries with their direct exposure to the energy sector. These stocks climbed 2.4%, 0.8%, 3.7% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past month and have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A CurseWhile almost every corner of the energy segment is shining, oil refiners might be hit. This is because the players in this industry use oil as an input for processing refined petroleum products. Hence, higher oil prices would crimp margins for refiners, leading to weak stock prices.Higher oil price has also resulted in a spike in gasoline and jet prices that would make summer driving most expensive in four years, per the Energy Information Administration. According to AAA, the average price at the pump is about $2.83, up 21% year over year, with drivers in nine states paying $3 a gallon for regular gasoline. As such, transportation stocks could see rough trading with airline stocks such as American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) being the biggest losers, as high fuel price may cut their profit margins.Rising pump price is threating Trump’s tax cut benefits, which is the major pillar for future America. According to Morgan Stanley, higher gas prices are on track to cost Americans an extra $38 billion in 2018, wiping out about one-third of the benefits from the reduced tax rates. Per the analyst at Moody’s, sustained increase in the gasoline price would cost the average American $450 a year, offsetting about half the tax benefit.Added to the woes is the resultant inflationary pressure that would raise the price of the products leading to a reduced consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. The discretionary and retail sectors would thus bear the brunt. However, these are the biggest gainers of the improving American economy and record consumer confidence. As a result, investors seeking to remain invested in these sectors should focus on the top-ranked stocks having Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

2275,WFC,"The S&P 500 financials sector rebounded nearly 1% on Jun 28, breaking its 13-day slump. Shares of all major banks jumped after the Fed announced the results of the final leg of the annual stress-test exercise, known as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The Fed gave an OK to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the United States that hold 80% of the total assets in the U.S. financial system, to raise their dividends and buy back shares.Interestingly, despite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks were widely expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. However, two of Wall Street’s biggest banks, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), failed two of the qualitative stress tests run by the Fed on banks’ capital plans.Consequently, the Fed asked Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to maintain their capital distribution at roughly last year’s level. Moreover, the U.S. arm of Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), failed the stress test, with the Fed rejecting its capital plan.Banks to Pay Higher DividendsMost of the major U.S. banks announced their dividend payout and share buyback plans after results from the second and final of stress test were announced. Despite a few stumbles in the test, the big banks are expected to pay $170 billion in combined dividends for the coming four quarters, as expected by analysts earlier. This is nearly $30 billion more than in the previous 12 months.The country’s four major banks, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo &Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup, Inc. (C  -  Free Report) will offer more than $110 billion through dividends payouts and share buyback. Post stress test results, as many as 20 banks announced their share buyback and dividend payout plans for the next four quarters.Bank Stocks ReboundAlmost a decade after the recession, profits of banks are steadily rising and they are lending more freely. This had made investors hopeful that banks would be paying out higher dividends this time. This saw bank stocks rebounding, with the S&P 500 Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gaining 0.9%.JP Morgan hinted at a 43% increase in its quarterly dividend and buy back of $20.7 billion in shares, while Wells Fargo will increase its quarterly dividend to 43 cents from 39 cents. American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) announced that it will increase its dividend by 11% and buy back $3.4 billion worth of shares.This saw shares of JPMorgan Chase and Well Fargo increase 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup jumped 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. The robust performance by banks stocks saw the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index increasing 0.6% on Thursday. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley FalterThe Fed forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to maintain their capital distribution to roughly last year’s level after the two major lenders failed to pass two important parts of the qualitative stress tests. According to results, both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had higher leverage than Fed’s requirement.However, the banks were given conditional no-objections to their subdued capital plans. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had last week said that they won’t return more than $6.8 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, in capital in the year starting in third quarter.Both banks raised their dividend by 5 cents each. The figures are certainly disappointing, as both banks last week had hinted that they were confident of returning more capital to their shareholders than the figures of regulators suggested. However, shares of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley jumped 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Goldman Sachs has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2276,WFC,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) are among the major banks which received the Fed’s green light to raise their dividends or repurchase shares.Among these, M&T Bank currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while all other banks carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2277,WFC,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q1 earnings releases. The going is great so far, with five big banks crushing estimates on both lines and one reporting mixed results. The backdrop should favor the banks along with the course of oil, the stance of the Fed and proposed policies of Trump.However, the restrained benchmark U.S. Treasury yields since mid-March, thanks to geopolitical risks and the tech space crash, is a concern for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at major banking earnings in detail:Big Bank Earnings in FocusJP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) reported earnings of $2.37 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28 in the first quarter of 2018. Also, the figure reflected a 44% rise from the year-ago period.Net revenues as reported were $27.9 billion in the quarter, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.8 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and increase in trading revenues were the main reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by lower investment banking revenues.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earned $1.12 per share in Q1, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 and improving from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03. The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.7 billion. However, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s tally of $22.3 billion.Wells Fargo appeared to have failed to benefit much from higher interest rates as rival JPMorgan did. Wells Fargo’s net interest margin was flat with the preceding quarter and down from the year-earlier level.Citigroup Inc.’s (C  -  Free Report) earnings per share of $1.68 for Q1 were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 and the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share. Revenues were up 3% year over year to $18.9 billion in the reported quarter. The revenue figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Citi’s FICC revenues were down 7% in Q1.Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 62 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Also, the figure was 38% higher than the prior-year quarter number. Net revenues came in at $23.1 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.9 billion.Thanks to strong fixed income trading revenues, Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 22.6%. The company reported earnings per share of $6.95, breezing past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67. Further, the bottom line witnessed 35% year-over-year improvement. Goldman’s net revenues were up 25% year over year to $10 billion in the quarter under review. The figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.9 billion.Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings from continuing operations of $1.45 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. The reported figure was 45% above the prior-year quarter. Net revenues amounted to $11.1 billion, reflecting a rise of 14% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.5 billion. FICC trading sales rose 12% during the quarter.Market ImpactInvestors, who have still their hopes pinned on a decent earnings season, Trump’s promises for deregulation and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) responded to the earnings releases. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (see all Financial ETFs here).Goldman and Morgan Stanley are not that prominent in the afore-mentioned ETFs, rather these are heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report).ETF PerformanceMost of these ETFs gave downbeat to decent performances in the last five days (as of April 17, 2018), in the peak of banking earnings releases. IAI gained 1.3% thanks to Goldman’s blockbuster earnings, IYF was up only 0.03% but VFH, IYG, XLF and KBWB lost in the range of 0.54% to 1.9%.Downbeat investors’ mood following Wells Fargo and Citi’s earnings have probably kept the whole sector from shooting higher. Goldman Sachs shares suffered for “halting buybacks”. However, Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster performance at the end should charge up the space ahead (read: Will Bank ETFs Sizzle on Fed & Trump Influenced Q1 Earnings?).Overall, the finance sector’s earnings are expected to be up 22.6%, as per the Earnings Trends issued on Apr 13, 2018. Among this, big banks are expected to log a 19.2% expansion in Q1.

2278,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, the most important development was the Fed’s decision to raise the outlook for number of rate hikes to four this year, apart from increasing the interest rates for the second time in 2018. Also, the central bank provided improved economic growth forecast for the year.As banks are the biggest beneficiary of higher interest rates and their overall growth is tied to that of the nation, these developments will likely further support their profitability.However, banks’ price performance was bearish over the last five trading sessions. So, what could be the reasons behind this dismal investor stance?Well, one of the reasons seems to be lackluster performance of the broader market over the same time frame. Impending trade war fear and geo-political tensions were the primary reasons for this dismal performance. So, banking stocks did not remain untouched.Further, the finding by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) wasn’t alone in opening unauthorized accounts and that there are several other major banks with similar business misconducts made investors skeptical. While no names were disclosed, the concern that banks may face additional probes and lawsuits hurt investor sentiments.Additionally, in line with other major banks, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) also provided soft trading outlook for the second quarter.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Jun 1, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

2279,WFC,"In order to compete with the startup lenders, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is mulling over ideas to simplify the credit and debit card pricing method for small companies. The news was reported by Bloomberg.The changes to be made are related to small business that process nearly $100,000 per year and deal with a complex pricing policy that require them to enter lengthy contracts and go through confusing rate tables. Also, the prices charged vary from customer to customer.Pressure has been created on traditional banks by startups like Square and Stripe that are consistently capturing the market on the back of their simple pricing method and technology. Wells Fargo has planned to introduce digital modes of applying for payment-processing capabilities for its customers.Danny Peltz, head of treasury management and merchant services at Wells Fargo said, “This industry is going through some structural changes -- not withstanding anything that’s happening at the bank -- and that’s driving our decision-making more so than anything else.”Recently, the bank was charged with yet another lawsuit. A federal lawsuit was filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, a big insurance company, for infringement of the latter’s patented technology.USAA has alleged Wells Fargo of violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal, Wells Fargo has been hit with a number of probes. These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated. However, the bank has diligently been taking remedial measures and initiatives to stay afloat. Also, lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 6.5% over the past six months versus the industry’s growth of nearly 1%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed 6.4% upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2280,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is slashing 100 jobs in its mortgage operations branch located in Fort Mill on account of subdued activity in U.S. housing market.""The decision to reduce our workforce is made with great concern for our team members. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is committed to retaining valued team members and, where possible, we will work to identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,"" the bank said.Wells Fargo has taken this decision to better align staff levels with present sales volume. The U.S. mortgage market is facing declining origination volumes as mortgage rates are becoming expensive. Further, intense competition and falling supplies of homes for sale has also impacted housing demands.For the first three months of 2018, Wells Fargo reported a decline in residential mortgage loan originations compared with the last few months of 2017.Similar Layoffs by Other BanksWells Fargo is not the only company to be impacted by declining mortgage activity. Other mortgage lenders have also announced layoffs in 2018 while some have shut down the segment altogether.In late May 2018, Movement Mortgage, a South Carolina-based mortgage lender, announced the decision to lay off about 100 employees after having already reduced its workforce by 75 employees in February.Also, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank, announced that it will cut 260 jobs, starting July, as it plans to close its Bedford mortgage and consumer banking office.In April 2018, MB Financial (MBFI  -  Free Report) disclosed plans to shut down its national mortgage origination business, which resulted in the layoff of almost 600 employees at locations across southeast Michigan.""With recent economic changes, the competitiveness of the mortgage industry, and recent low origination margins, we determined that we would be unable to successfully execute that strategy within a reasonable period of time"", CEO Mitch Feiger said in a statement at the time.Our TakeWells Fargo is finally on the journey to move ahead of its past misconducts and legal involvements. Its impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the pressure on costs.

2281,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, bank stocks have put up a lackluster show. Mortgage rates declined in the week, hitting 4.57%, along with bond yields, on escalating U.S.-China trade war fears.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during this week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased.On the other hand, on Thursday, the Federal Reserve released the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results, which, to a great extent, reflect stability in the banking system. In fact, this reaffirms that the U.S. banking giants are adequately capitalized to survive under a tremendously difficult economic scenario.All bank holding companies (BHCs), including certain U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, have passed the first round of test.Nevertheless, coming to company-specific news, litigations and probes pertaining to the past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track to resolve such issues, avoiding lengthy litigations. Moreover, restructuring activities of banks continued with the target of improving operational efficiency.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending Jun 15, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Resolution to past misconducts related to interest rate rigging continues for banks. Recently, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) charged JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) with $65-million penalty for trying to manipulate ISDAfix rates — the benchmark rate for fixed interest rate swap rates — between 2007 and 2012. Per the CFTC, employees at JPMorgan made false reports and attempted to manipulate the reference rate by “bidding, offering, and executing transactions in targeted interest rate products” during the five-year period. (Read more: JPMorgan to Pay $65 Million as Swap Rate Manipulation Charge)Among others, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) has agreed to resolve a lawsuit that accused it of rigging London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

2282,WFC,"Last Friday, as per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it had ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018. Per the filing “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018.Notably, Wells Fargo refrained from the allegations but said it had ""entered into the agreement in principle to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation.""“We are pleased to reach this agreement in principle and believe that moving to put this case behind us is in the best interest of our team members, customers, investors and other stakeholders,” noted CEO Tim Sloan. “We are making strong progress in our work to rebuild trust, and this represents another step forward,” he further added.The Story So FarThe above-mentioned case relates to the revelation of a sales scam, wherein the bank’s employees allegedly opened millions of unauthorized accounts illegally, to meet their aggressive internal sales goals.This financial bigwig has been under inquiry for setting impractical sales targets for its employees, compelling them to adopt fraudulent means for meeting the same. Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales tactics were first disclosed by The Los Angeles Times in 2013, when Los Angeles City’s Attorney Mike Feuer had begun investigation. This probe led to a lawsuit accusing the bank of high-pressure sales goals that encouraged unfair, illegal and fraudulent conduct, such as issuing unwanted credit cards to customers.The scandal was agitated in September 2016 following which the bank paid a combined penalty of $190 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the City and County of Los Angeles. In addition, the amount included $5 million in customer remediation.Per the above-discussed class action lawsuit, the investors’ claims included misappropriation of facts by Wells Fargo related to its cross-selling strategy which was not used for benefit of customers. However, the bank tried to ""designed to fulfill sales quotes or otherwise advance the interests of Wells Fargo or its employees and increase sources of profitability while simultaneously burdening customers with financial products they did not authorize, need and/or even know about,"" the suit claimed.Therefore, this led the shares to trade at ""artificially inflated prices,"" per the suit.Notably, investors filing the suit include buyers of Wells Fargo's shares between Feb 26, 2014, and Sep 15, 2016, following the bank’s $185-million settlement which resulted in a dip in its share prices. Union Investment — a European asset-management firm — was the lead plaintiff in the case, appointed by the court.Bottom LineCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.In February 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).Recently, the banking giant faced a penalty of $1 billion imposed by the CFPB and OCC due to its wrongdoings in the auto insurance and mortgage-lending business. As a result, the company’s first-quarter 2018 preliminary financial results got adjusted by an additional accrual of $800 million, which is not tax deductible. The accrual reduced the reported first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per share to $4.7 billion, or 96 cents per share.The bank’s performance over the past year underlines investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 4.8%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 12.3%. Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2283,WFC,"Welcome to Episode #129 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Sheraz Mian, Zacks Director of Research, to discuss the fantastic first quarter earnings season and the possibility of peak earnings.First Quarter Earnings are FantasticEarnings are turning out as everyone expected: great.Earnings are expected to rise 22.8% in the first quarter, up from a 13.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2017.They’re also expected to be up by more than double digits in every remaining quarter of 2018.This has many worried about “peak” earnings and that this is the best that companies will be able to do.Is it peak earnings?And how should you invest if it is?Evolution of Q1 and Q2 Growth EstimatesMonths ago, it became obvious that the first quarter earnings season was going to be phenomenal because the first quarter growth estimates were soaring.But what about the second quarter?While earnings are expected to rise 17.9% in Q2, the evolution has been flat. There hasn’t been a rise in expectations since March.That means we’re not seeing as many surprise beats and raises. The strong earnings growth is already priced in.If This is Peak Earnings, Where Should You Invest?Two sectors are seeing strong earnings and revenue growth in the first quarter: finance and energy.Here are some finance favorites:1.       PacWest Bancorp (PACW  -  Free Report) is a big California regional bank. It just raised its dividend, which now yields 4.6%. It’s a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).2.       WesBanco (WSBC  -  Free Report) is a West Virginia regional bank which recently announced it was buying Farmers Capital Corporation for $378 million. Combined with other acquisitions, that buy should push it towards $12 billion in assets by the end of next year.3.       Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is a Texas regional bank with a forward P/E of 14. It pays a dividend yielding 1.3%. Earnings are expected to rise 40% in 2018. It’s also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).4.       JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) is in the Value Investor portfolio. It’s expected to grow earnings by 30% in 2018. This large cap bank pays a dividend that yields 2.1%.5.       Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is the black sheep of the big banks. Shares are down nearly 14% year-to-date. But it’s also the cheapest of the big banks with a forward P/E of just 11.4. It also pays a dividend, currently yielding a healthy 3%.The energy sector also appears to be under valued compared to others. If oil prices rise into the $70 - $80 range, there could be an even bigger earnings growth upside.What else should investors know about peak earnings and where to look for investing ideas?Find out on this week’s podcast.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2284,WFC,"With a view to cut costs, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with Flagstar Bancorp (FBC  -  Free Report) to divest all of its branches in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. While the financial details were not disclosed, the deal is expected to close in the last quarter of 2018.The 52 branches in consideration, including four branches of Wisconsin, comprise about $2.3 billion in deposits. Also, 490 employees working across the branches will continue to work with Flagstar.Post this deal, Wells Fargo will cease to have retail banking presence in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. However, the bank will continue providing commercial banking, wealth management and retail brokerage services across the region.The transaction is in line with the Wall Street biggie’s target to reduce branches by about 800 by the end of 2020 to combat high legal expenses. Also, shift in preferences of consumers to online and mobile banking marks as another key reason behind the closures.Troubles for Wells Fargo had begun from its retail banking segment in September 2016, when its employees had opened unauthorized accounts on behalf of its clients to fulfil sales targets. Following this, scandals in different areas of business had come to light, which put Wells Fargo under strict supervision of regulators.In May 2018, Wells Fargo had disclosed an impressive cost-control plan to help it deal with persistent legal expenses. Also, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position supported by lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 8.2% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) current-year earnings estimates have been revised 4.7% upward over the last 60 days.

2285,WFC,"Earnings of the biggest U.S. banks vaulted to the highest level in the first quarter after 2007 on corporate tax cuts. Without the tax overhaul, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) earnings would have shrunk, while Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) would see tepid growth.Rising interest rates, by the way, boosted lending activities, while volatility made a comeback in the first quarter helping trading revenues improve. Lesser regulations also reduced banks’ costs and drove earnings.This bullishness puts the spotlight on banks that are likely to make the most of this earnings season. Banks are poised to report stellar earnings, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Big Banks Make $2.5B From Tax LawBig banks have significantly benefitted in the first quarter from the latest federal tax law. The combined earnings of Goldman Sachs and four major national banks, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America, increased more than $2.5 billion in the said quarter due to a lower corporate tax rate, according to an analysis of bank results by The Wall Street Journal.The new tax bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, making it the biggest one-time drop in business tax rates ever. Making the most of it, Goldman Sachs recorded first-quarter profit growth of 26% year over year as the tax cut lifted earnings by around $232 million. Without tax savings, Goldman’s earnings would have been down by a quarter. Wells Fargo’s earnings would have also declined from year-ago levels while a major chunk of the year-over-year growth at Citigroup and Bank of America would have been erased.The tax overhaul, in the meantime, helped both the Bank of America and JP Morgan add about $798 million and $470 million in net-income growth, respectively. As it is, banks face a high tax burden, which makes them gain handsomely when tax rates go down. KBW estimates had already noted that banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan to name a few will always enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is trimmed to around 20%.Banks Operating Activity Remains FirmWhile the big banks acknowledged that the reduction in corporate tax rate boosted their first=quarter earnings, their operations also continue to remain solid.Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael Corbat said that “a lower tax rate was a contributing factor to the bank’s results along with strong business performance.”Bank of America’s Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio acknowledged that “earnings growth was driven not only by tax reform but also operating leverage and continued strong asset quality,”JPMorgan’s CFO Marianne Lake added that tax overhaul boosted earnings but the banks’ results also profited from “broad-based strength.”Higher Interest Rates – Always Good for BanksCitigroup, Bank of America and JP Morgan benefited from the Fed’s rates hikes twice in the past four months, which means that they can charge more for loans. Needless to say, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.All the three banks have registered higher net interest income in the first quarter, which they have attributed to higher rates and loan growth. A strong jobs market and rise in income have lent consumers the flexibility to borrow more. Wells Fargo, however, was prohibited by the Fed from increasing its assets provided it addresses recent mishaps. Thus, the diversified financial services company saw its interest income take a dip.Volatility Bolster Equity Trading Stock market turbulence in the first three months of the year, triggered by uncertainty over global trade policy and possibilities of higher prices of essential commodities, boosted the banks’ derivatives and prime-service desks. Market volatility helped JP Morgan post record revenue growth from equity trading while Citigroup and Bank of America recorded their best revenue growth since 2010.Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets rightly pointed out that “the volatility in the markets came in and helped the equity trading. In particular, equity derivatives benefited both Bank of America as well as the other players.”5 Bank Stocks to Buy in Q1 EarningsThe aforesaid factors will surely help banks stay afloat in the first quarter. For the Finance sector, of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 22.7% from the same period last year on 4.7% higher revenues. This would follow 0.6% earnings growth in the preceding quarter on 4% higher revenues.This calls for investing in five banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in first-quarter earnings. These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP — our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2286,WFC,"The Federal Reserve’s first round of stress test this year reflects that the nation’s biggest banks are ‘well capitalized.’On Thursday, the Fed released the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results. It shows that all 35 banks (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) are adequately capitalized to survive under tremendously difficult economic conditions.The tests, conducted annually since 2009, are a must for big banks. These are designed to ensure that these banks are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn.The Fed’s Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said, “Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession.”Detail Analysis of ResultsThis year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10% along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) reported CET1 ratio of 8.6%, highest among the four big banks. The other three — Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) — had their ratios above 7%. All these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from this, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions. However, in this year’s test, Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) have the last two positions with SLRs of 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. So, this might result in these two companies adjusting their capital plans.In a statement, Goldman commented that it did not agree with the Fed’s stress test results and intends to discuss the “divergence” before next week’s test. Additionally, Morgan Stanley stated that the results “may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make.”Notably, in response to recently passed Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, the Fed dropped CIT Group, Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and Zions Bancorporation from this year’s test. The act exempts banks with total consolidated assets of less than $100 million from this annual exercise.A Bigger Payout PossibleBanks are optimistic, given the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations. They are keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares).According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders are projected to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, nearly 25% more than last year. Among these, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (despite facing several probes and lawsuits related to business misconducts), Bank of America and Citigroup are expected to lead the race.But the clearance of the stress test does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the banks qualify for bigger capital deployment. The companies will have to wait till Jun 28 for approval of their capital plans.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

"
2288,WFC,"Considering how we ended last week — with a mid-day Dow cratering more than 500 points — this week, while continuing with overall trademark volatility associated with markets in 2018, has been much easier to swallow. And, not including those unfortunate souls affected by triskaidekaphobia, Friday the 13th does not look to be striking fear into the hearts of traders this morning.It’s understandable why: with China backing off its toughest stance regarding future trade negotiations earlier this week following a fearful standoff most of last week, the specter of an attack on Syria not having yet been realized, and even a reported presidential re-think on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal have lent plenty of relief to market indexes this week and ahead of today’s opening bell.We also see the dawning of Q1 earnings season taking effect as of this morning, with the biggest of the Wall Street banks putting out earnings reports. All good news on this front: JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all topped estimates in both earnings and revenues. All three companies — prior to Q1 earnings results — currently carry Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) recommendations.For JPMorgan, earnings of $2.37 per share outpaced the expectations of $2.28 per share. Quarterly revenues reached $28.5 billion, ahead of the $27.8 billion analysts had been looking for, and well ahead of the $25.9 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. CEO Jamie Dimon was quoted as saying, “Our units are doing well across the board.” For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.Citigroup earnings also posted higher than the Zacks consensus, with $1.68 per share versus the $1.61 estimate. Revenues, however, came in a bit light of expectations at $18.87 billion, beneath the $18.90 billion our estimates had tallied. Like JPMorgan, Citi enjoyed a benefit in the quarter from a vastly reduced corporate tax rate, though analysts have been baking in these figures in their estimates.Wells Fargo, still working through its accounts scandal from past quarters, beat the Zacks consensus on the bottom line by 5 cents, reporting $1.12 per share. Revenues of $21.93 billion surpassed expectations of $21.68 billion in the quarter, which also saw corporate tax relief resulting in 5.5% growth year over year.Elsewhere, a new set of accounting standard principles for General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) is bringing the company to restate its earnings for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. According to the company’s 10K, both years are expected to bring deeper losses as the company takes on the heavy lifting required to dig itself out of its multiple-year hole it dug for itself. Included in its near-term activities will reportedly be the sale of $20 billion in assets. GE shares are -55% year over year, and currently at lows not seen since Bill Clinton was president.

2289,WFC,"Markets closed higher on Thursday, on hopes of a robust earnings season and easing geopolitical tensions after U.S President Donald Trump tweeted that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent.

On Nasdaq, a 1.84-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 293.60 points as geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia eased following Trump’s tweet that a missile attack on Syria may not be imminent. Moreover, optimism around earnings season gave investors’ confidence a boost, with all three major indexes closing the day higher.The S&P 500 closed 21.82 points higher, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gaining 1.8% on robust earnings season expectations.

However, on Thursday, Trump’s tweet came to the rescue of the markets.Investors, who panicked on Wednesday, finally felt confident after Trump’s in a tweet said: “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place.

The high expectations from this season’s earnings saw the markets rallying, led by bank stocks. Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +16% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years (read more).The Q1 earnings season will be in full swing from Friday, with major banks like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), J.P.

2291,WFC,"Banks are gearing up to kick-off the Q1 earnings season. Emergence of long-dormant volatility due to trade war tensions, technology industry woes and inflation will certainly drive trading revenues. Rising interest rates, for now, will enhance net interest margins, while more confident consumers and a record low jobless rate are sure to boost lending activities. Needless to say, reduction in corporate taxes will boost earnings as banks will be able to retain a larger part of their revenues. Such tax cuts have also stoked a wave of deal signings. Banks should benefit from financing such large mergers and takeovers.Let us, thus, focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season. Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Volatility Boosts Activity on Trading FloorsThe era of calm markets and small swing in prices are almost over. Escalating tariff tensions between the United States and China have raised fears of a full-fledged trade war, while investors fret over data-privacy crisis, setbacks in the self-driving car segment and rise in prices of essential commodities. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), continues to hover above its historic average of 20, while it had jumped 118%, its sharpest rise in record, in February.A choppier market, however, could well spur trading activities that constitute the bulk of investment bank’s revenues. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) added that capital market business are projected to grow about 4% year over year, mostly driven by volatility.Fed Hikes Rates – A Welcome News for BanksAs widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate by 0.25%, at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21. The central bank projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020, citing a healthy economic outlook. The vote to lift the benchmark lending rate was a unanimous 8-0. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank needs to keep raising rates in order to control inflation.A move toward higher rates is favorable for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. But, this time around higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Loans to GrowU.S. consumer sentiment in March, by the way, reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market. The sentiment index rose to 101.4 in March from 99.7 in February, per the University of Michigan.While the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month. On a year-over-year basis, pay edged up to 2.7%. Although jobs addition in March were a lot less compared to February, the United States added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016.All these factors will lend consumers the flexibility to borrow more and reduce loan default risks, which bode well for banks.Tax Reform – A Definite Boost for BanksThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December remains a positive for banks this year, per Goldman Sachs. As per the tax overhaul policy, corporate tax rate has been slashed from 35% to 21%. Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to around 20%.Goldman further added that such a tax reform could propel overall bank earnings as much as 10% in the near term and return on tangible common equity (TCE) as many as 130 basis points. TCE is widely used to measure a company’s financial strength.5 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading in to Q1The aforesaid factors will surely help banks stay afloat this Q1. For the Finance sector, of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 19.1% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow 0.6% earnings growth in the preceding quarter on 4% higher revenues (read more: Bank Earnings Finally Taking Off).This calls for investing in five banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings.

2292,WFC,"Most banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of rising rates, lower taxes and improved trading activities. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, the results show eased margin pressure.Importantly, high volatility led to improved trading activities in the quarter, leading to higher trading revenues for banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 13, 2018)Important Earnings of the Week1.

Nonetheless, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Additionally, expenses soared.

The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter. Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth.

2293,WFC,"The infamous Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) fake accounts scandal has now extended to other major banks as well, per the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the federal bank regulator. Though the OCC refrains from disclosing the names of the banks involved, it claims having evidences related to sales practices of these large- and mid-sized banks creating unauthorized accounts.During the congressional hearings this week, Joseph Otting, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, revealed that the findings are the part of the OCC’s review of more than 40 banks, which was initiated following the disclosure of the Wells Fargo scandal in 2016. He disclosed that around 10,000 unauthorized accounts were opened during the three-year period without customers’ consent. Moreover, these banks lacked papers authenticating customers’ authorization for these accounts.Notably, the review ended in 2017, following which banks were sent letters in early 2018, stating their detailed issues.Per Otting, the new mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, checking, savings and money market accounts represent just a meagre part of the nearly 600 million accounts opened by the banks during the three-year tenure.""The OCC did not find pervasive or systemic issues in regard to improper account openings but did find the need for banks to improve their policies, procedures and controls,"" Otting told the Senate Banking Committee.Reimbursement to affected customers due to such practices is likely to take place ""if they can document an account was opened inappropriately,"" Otting added.Though Republican members of House, and Senate banking and finance committees were not keen in getting into the issue, some Democratic members of the panels insisted on a detailed disclosure.""We are concerned that the decision to keep the specific findings of the review private leaves consumers exposed to past and future predatory behavior and impedes our ability as lawmakers to effectively conduct oversight over the banking industry,"" eight Senate Democrats wrote in a Thursday letter to Otting.However, per Otting, the recently reviewed banks’ issues are not that stern as compared with Wells Fargo’s failures.For this Wall Street giant, troubles mounted following the revelation of opening of millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. ‘Cross-selling’, which has been the company’s key strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of employees of the bank had unlawfully enrolled consumers in products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting sales targets. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, the bank had to undergo a massive restructuring.Though Wells Fargo is taking necessary steps to address the issue, the company’s financials are undoubtedly under pressure.Broadly, if big names, including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), come under the purview of such a scandal, the banking sector will lose its momentum, paralyzing investors’ confidence.Currently, all the above-mentioned banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2294,WFC,"Already grappling with legal issues, the Wall Street giant — Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) — has been slapped with another federal lawsuit. A federal lawsuit has been filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, the big insurance company, for infringement on the latter’s patented technology.The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court in Marshall, TX. USAA has accused the bank for violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.USAA demands fine for infringement damages, including interest and attorneys' fees.Story So FarFor the past year, USAA has been asking hundreds of financial institutions for licensing its RDC technology. Finally, it took the first legal action by filing the lawsuit against Wells Fargo. Per this suit, in August 2007, USAA had requested Wells Fargo to negotiate a licensing deal, which was ignored by the bank. Therefore, USAA demanded reinforcing of its patents, along with damages. Notably, the company holds about 50 patents associated with its mobile deposit of checks.“Wells Fargo is one of the biggest adopters of remote deposit capture,” said Nathan McKinley, USAA’s head of Corporate Development, which includes commercialization of the company’s intellectual property. “We believe they are leveraging the technology to improve their bottom line, and they failed to take a license,” McKinley noted.Per the lawsuit, 21 million active mobile-banking customers of Wells Fargo are accessing this technology, as of February.Spokesperson for Wells Fargo refrained from comments on the pending litigation.The lawsuit states its “improper for Wells Fargo to use, without permission, patented technologies that USAA has spent immense resources to invent, develop, implement and perfect.”The aforementioned mobile-deposit technology was initiated by USAA in 2009. “We developed mobile check deposit technology using our members’ money to help military families because their lifestyle often made getting to the bank difficult,” McKinley said. “We believe the industry has been able to save billions using our mobile check deposit technology. We also believe the industry is aware USAA developed it,” he further added.Bottom LineCurrently, Wells Fargo is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past six months underlines investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.4%, significantly underperforming the industry’s marginal increase of 0.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2296,WFC,"Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most respected investors. He and Berkshire Hathaway  have long favored companies that offer reasonable valuations, mixed with growth opportunities, which sounds simple enough. Here’s a look at some of Berkshire’s top holdings to see if they currently present investors solid value.The last time Berkshire disclosed its holdings it boasted a massive $170 billion stock portfolio. The top five holdings represented roughly 68% of the aggregate fair value. The list featured Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) at $40.7 billion, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) at $25.2 billion, Bank of America (BAC) at $21.0 billion, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) at $17.4 billion, and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) at $14.1 billion. The conglomerate’s other holdings included Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and dozens of other stocks, which they owned much smaller amounts of.So now that we have covered some of Berkshire’s top holdings, let’s take a look at what kind of value Buffett’s top three holdings currently present.Apple Price - Performance/ Valuation Apple is Berkshire’s biggest holding, a spot that is recently took over. In fact, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 the company owned $28.2 billion worth of Apple stock. Therefore, Berkshire bought roughly $12.5 billion worth of shares in a very short amount of time.Shares of Apple have skyrocketed nearly 95% over the last two years, outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 30% surge. Apple stock has also climbed over 14% since the start of the year, which helped it hit a brand new all-time high on Tuesday.Coming into Wednesday, Apple stock was trading at 15.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Apple has traded as high as 17.2X, with a one-year median of 14.9X. Apple stock has also traded as low as 13.2X during this time period, yet investors should note that Apple stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 16.9X. Over the last decade, Apple stock has traded as high as 30.8X. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to say that Apple’s valuation is far from stretched at this time and remains attractive compared to the S&P while remaining relatively in line with its year-long median.Wells Fargo - Price Performance/ Valuation Shares of the embattled banking giant are up just 35% over the last five years, which is far worse the S&P 500’s 71% surge. WFC stock is up 6.6% over the last year but has sunk 8.4% since the start of the year. With that said, Wells Fargo stock currently presents solid value.WFC is trading at 11.3X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to its industry’s 11.4X average—which includes Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and other banking powers.Investors should note that Wells Fargo has traded as high as 15.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 12.4X. Therefore, WFC’s current valuation appears more than fair at the moment.Bank of America - Price Performance/ ValuationBank of America has seen its stock price climb nearly 124% over the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s 71% surge while also beating its industry’s 67% charge. Narrowing the focus a bit more, BAC stock is up over 32% during the last year, nearly doubling its industry’s gains.One might think that these gains would make BAC’s valuation look a little stretch at the moment, but that hardly seems to be the case. Bank of America stock is currently trading at 10.9X, which is just a hair above its year-long low and also represents a discount compared to its year-long median of 12.4X.Investors will note that Bank of America stock is presenting its best value since the fall of 2016. It is also worth pointing out that AAPL, WFC, and BAC are all currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

Moreover, results were up from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03. Results were benefitted from lower provisions and higher interest income, partially offset by elevated interest expense and non-interest expenses.Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.How Was the Estimate Revision Trend?You should note that the earnings estimate for Wells Fargo depicted neutral stance prior to the earnings release.

The same is the kind of surprise prediction for Wells Fargo, with a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.73%.On the other hand, Citi has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.74%. This lowers the predictive power of ESP because a negative ESP dampens our surprise prediction power that gets a boost from a favorable Zacks Rank.Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is expected to report on Apr 16 before the market opens. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -0.31%. Needless to say, here also, surprise prediction is tough. All four stocks hail from a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 38%).On Apr 17 and Apr 18, GoldmanSachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) are likely to come up with their earnings releases, respectively. Both have a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of 0.00%, which doesn’t make them sure-shot candidates for an earnings beat.Notably, while both stocks belong to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 49%), the VGM Scores are not favorable with Goldman having a score of D and Morgan Stanley having a score of C.  What Fundamentals Indicate About Bank ETFs?As discussed above, chances of a broad-based earnings beat are moderate. However, the financial sector, is likely to log a strong show in Q1 and the coming quarters, per the Earnings Trends issued on Apr 11, 2018 (read: Inside Q4 Earnings Performance of Banking ETFs).Major banks, which make up about 45% of the sector’s total earnings in the S&P 500, are expected to post 11.3% earnings growth on 4.8% higher revenues. It is the Fed and Trump who can drive the sector.The Fed in the form of policy tightening and consequent higher yields should have benefited the sector in Q1. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury started 2018 with 2.46%, hit a high of 2.94% in February, but finally came down to 2.74% on Mar 29.  The average benchmark bond yield in Q1 of 2018 was around 2.7615%, up from 2.4466% average yield recorded in the year-ago quarter (read: Q1 ETF Asset Report: Developed Markets Win, High-Yield Loses).Trump in the form of tax reform, which has been passed in late 2017, can benefit the financial space. Financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5% in the S&P sector universe, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates, quoted on Reuters. Naturally, the section is poised to perform better in a low-tax environment (read: Best ETF Strategies for a Hawkish Fed).ETFs in FocusSo, investors pinning their hopes on a moderate-to-upbeat earnings season, Trump’s policies for a fiscal boost and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) are performing before the earnings releases.These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks. Goldman has moderate exposure in the aforementioned ETFs; rather it is heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report) (see all Financial ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2299,WFC,"We are in the first week of the Q1 reporting cycle and only a handful of the S&P 500 players have released their quarterly numbers so far. In fact, this reporting cycle has started on a solid note, courtesy of better-than-expected results from big names in the banking space like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Bullish Q1 ViewsPer the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at an impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%. The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.Strong Expectations From Business ServicesEarnings prospects in Q1 are encouraging with the Business Services Sector expected to be up 10.7% from the year-earlier level on 4.8% higher revenues.Usually, the sector is directly proportional to the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable. In fact, a rise in GDP, record-low unemployment level, strong job additions, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, which in turn should boost the business service sector. Trump’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts, and repeal of regulations are additional tailwinds.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Apr 19Exponent (EXPO  -  Free Report) is a science and engineering consulting company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 62 cents, reflecting a massive improvement of 59% compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.Meanwhile, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $88 million, reflecting 10% growth from the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.Also, Exponent has an impressive earnings surprise history having surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 12.4%.Shares of the company have rallied 17.3% year to date against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS  -  Free Report) is a leading data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions provider. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at $4.27 per share and $1.9 billion, respectively.Earnings estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figures, reflect growth of 9.2%. Revenue estimates shows a 2.3% year-over-year improvement.Alliance Data Systems’ earnings surprise history has been impressive too. The company outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9%.The stock has declined 16.5% year to date against its industry’s rally of 6.2%.What Does Our Model Suggest?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Conversely, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stock should be avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While Exponent has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, Alliance Data Systems has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.17%.

Including certain non-recurring items, earnings came in at $1.59. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.49.Higher revenues and improved credit metrics were recorded. Moreover, rise in loans was another tailwind. However, lower deposits and rise in expenses were undermining factors.Shares of Comerica edged down more than 1% in the pre-market session, indicating that investors have been bearish on the results.

Moreover, net interest margin expanded 56 basis points (bps) to 3.41%.Total adjusted non-interest income came in at $244 million, slightly down on a year-over-year basis. Lower card fees, commercial lending fees, bank-owned life insurance and other non-interest income were mostly offset by increased fiduciary income and brokerage fees.Further, adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $430 million, up 2.4% year over year. The rise was chiefly due to higher salaries and benefits expense, and restructuring charges.Notably, Growth in Efficiency and Revenue (GEAR Up) Initiative Implementation resulted in increased pre-tax income of 25%.Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $72.3 billion and $8 billion, respectively, compared with $73 billion and $7.9 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.Total loans inched up 1.9% year over year to $49.2 billion.

In addition, provision for credit losses declined 25% year over year to $12 million.Strong Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company's tangible common equity ratio was 10.29%, up 19 bps year over year. Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.96%, up from 11.55% reported in the year-ago quarter. Total risk-based capital ratio was 14.10%, up from 13.72% in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateComerica’s capital-deployment initiatives highlight the company’s capital strength. During the reported quarter, Comerica repurchased 1.6 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $201 million to shareholders.Impressive Outlook for 2018Comerica guided for 2018 as compared with 2017, taking into consideration the current economic and rate environment, along with the GEAR Up initiative, resulting in $270 million of benefits.The company anticipates higher net interest income, including the benefit of short-term rate increase and loan growth. Notably, full-year benefits from 2017 and first-quarter 2018 rate increases of $205-$215 million are expected.Non-interest income is estimated to be higher, reflecting an increase of 4% (excluding accounting-changes impact of $120 million and deferred compensation of $8 million). The rise is expected on the GEAR Up opportunities driving growth in treasury management and card fees, along with fiduciary and brokerage services.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be higher by 1%, excluding an estimated $25-$45 million restructuring expense and accounting changes impact of $120 million. Notably, additional $50 million in GEAR Up savings is expected.Restructuring charges of $47-$57 million is anticipated.

The outlook reflects rise across most lines of business, and stability in energy and corporate banking portfolios.Q2 2018 OutlookAverage loans are expected to be up sequentially due to seasonality, particularly in Mortgage Banker Finance.Net interest income is likely to escalate on full-quarter impact from first-quarter 2018 rate increase and the return of loan growth.Provision for credit losses are expected to be higher.Non-interest expenses are predicted to decrease moderately, mainly due to lower compensation expense.Our ViewpointThe consistent improvement in the loan portfolio is projected to offset the pressure on revenues to some extent. Further, the company will benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Its robust capital position supports steady capital-deployment activities through share repurchases and dividend hikes which seem impressive. Though regulatory issues and rise in expenses remain major concerns, rising rates remained a tailwind. Comerica Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Comerica carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income with lower mortgage revenues were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared.

However, lower financial advisory revenues (down 22%) due to decreased industry-wide completed mergers and acquisition transactions were recorded.The Investment Management division recorded revenues of $1.8 billion, up 18% year over year.

The new dividend will be paid on Jun 28 to common shareholders of record as on May 31, 2018.ConclusionResults of Goldman highlight an impressive quarter.

The company’s well-diversified business, apart from its solid investment banking operations, continues to ensure earnings stability.Its focus to capitalize on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, will likely bolster overall business growth. However, costs stemming from brokerage and market development remain near- to medium-term headwinds. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

2302,WFC,"Shares of American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) climbed on Monday in a sign that investors might be anticipating strong first quarter earnings. So let’s take a quick look to see what investors should expect from American Express when the company reports its Q1 financial results on Wednesday.American Express has seen its stock price sink roughly 7% over the last 12 weeks. But first quarter earnings season could very well help AXP recover from its recent downturn, especially if the company performs well.  Earnings season often provides investors the chance to look for stocks that are set to top earnings estimates and sometimes, more importantly, stay away from stocks that look poised to fall short of expectations. American Express follows JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), and other financial services firms that recently released their Q1 earnings results, which means that many investors have already gotten in a bit of an earnings season groove.Q1 OutlookAmerican Express’ Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 15.3% to reach $9.1 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.Meanwhile, American Express’ quarterly earnings are expected to soar over 29.1% to $1.73 per share. Investors should also note that American Express has earned one downward earnings estimate revision within the last seven days.However, this still doesn’t give investors any idea if American Express is actually projected to top our current earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.American Express is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -4.67%. The credit card company’s Most Accurate Estimate for Q1 is $1.65 per share, which comes in 8 cents below our current consensus estimate. This means that the most recent estimates have come in lower directly ahead of earnings.With that said, investors should consider American Express a stock that could fall short of Q1 earnings estimates.AXP is expected to report its first quarter financial results after market close on Wednesday, April 18. Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

2303,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) gained as much as 2% in morning trading Thursday as investors gear up for the embattled bank giant’s soon-to-be-released earnings report. The firm will join peers like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) in reporting Friday morning.Wells Fargo’s report will be another measurement of the company’s ongoing effort to regain public trust in the wake of its fraudulent account scandal, and with other major questions lingering around the entire finance sector, investors will want to pay close attention to this earnings announcement. Here’s what to expect from the bank’s first quarter 2018 report tomorrow.Industry TrendsWells Fargo belongs to our “Banks – Major Regional” group, which includes 16 of the largest commercial banks and currently sits in the top 48% of the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained nearly 19% within the past 52 weeks, but many of the industry’s top stocks have slumped over the past month as new headwinds threaten its strong momentum.The main concern for investors in this space is interest rate uncertainty. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note have moved sideways recently—a change to the uptrend in treasury yields that had been witnessed since September. The Fed is expected to continue tightening its monetary policy, but now it is unclear whether the central bank will target four rate hikes, or more, this year.Investors with exposure to the banking industry will continue to monitor this story as they clamor for higher interest rates, which typically serve as an earnings growth catalyst.Latest Outlook and ValuationThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.07. This would mark a decline of about 1.5% from the year-ago period. Nevertheless, the bank is projected to post revenue of $21.70 billion, an improvement of 7.0% on a year-over-year basis.Ahead of its report, Wells Fargo is trading with a Forward P/E of 10.7. This is a slight discount to the industry average of 11.8. Over the past year, the stock has traded as high as 15.6x forward 12-month earnings and as low as 10.6x. Its median Forward P/E over this time is 12.5.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Wells Fargo surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Wells Fargo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.7%. This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus. In other words, our model is suggesting that a beat is likely.Surprise HistoryInvestors also want to consider Wells Fargo’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these beats have had on share prices. The company missed earnings estimates in the most-recent quarter, but before that, it had surpassed our consensus in five-consecutive quarters. However, the stock has not always performed well during earnings season.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Over the last six quarters, Wells Fargo has only moved higher once during this window.Want more market analysis from this author?

2304,WFC,"Over the last four trading days, performance of banking stocks has been encouraging. Easing U.S.-China trade war tension has provided some respite to investors, infusing overall positivity in the market.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 4.4%, along with bond yields, on fears of a trade war. Despite this, investors are apprehensive about parking funds in the housing market, thanks to the volatility in the financial world. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time gainers.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during the week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased due to the political tension, only to bounce back near to 2.82% as fears of the trade war waned.Notably, mortgage applications plunged last week, per the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. In addition, the refinance share of mortgage activity came in at 38.5% of all applications.Though economic data might be affected marginally due to slapping of trade tariffs by the United States and China, the first-quarter GDP is expected to grow moderately and consumer spending is anticipated to bear minimal brunt. Therefore, positive numbers and anticipations of an improving job market might lead to rise in housing demand.Regarding company-specific news related to banks, streamlining operations and steady capital-deployment activities persisted over the last four trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

2305,WFC,"With a view to trim costs and enhance the quality of customer service, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is making plans to merge corporate and investment banks. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Citing people familiar with the matter, the journal reported that the bank’s restructuring move is likely to result in job cuts in industry coverage, advising, equity and debt capital along with corporate-level relationship managerial positions.Since news of the fake account scandals broke out, a lot of employees at Wells Fargo have been laid off. In July 2017, the company had removed about 70 senior executives from their posts. Some of the employees had moved to lower level positions while some preferred to shift to a new company.Furthermore, in its annual filing, Wells Fargo disclosed that it overcharged customers in its investment and fiduciary services business.  Also, the company said the review process of the Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages”.Due to the review conducted on the bank’s operations and staff level adjustments, some positions of Wells Fargo’s senior and junior level employees across credit sales and trading areas are likely to be affected. Per the newspaper, layoffs due to the review are not linked with Wells Fargo’s integration plans.We believe that Wells Fargo’s bottom-line growth is likely to be affected by legal hassles in the near term. However, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position along with support from lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 3.4% over the past six months against the 5.7% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward estimate revision of nearly 1% in the last 30 days.

2307,WFC,"Amid the ongoing debate over the role of Wall Street in promoting gun safety, many financial companies are taking serious measures by reviewing and making changes in their business relationship with gun manufacturers and retailers.  Recently, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), in a notice posted on its website, announced the launch of new funds and index-tracking products that exclude gun manufacturers and retailers. This means that retailers – Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Dick's Sporting Goods and Kroger – (that have limited their sale of firearms to customers aged 21 or more) will not be part of the newly launched products.Also, the three largest U.S. publicly traded gun companies — Sturm Ruger (RGR  -  Free Report), American Outdoor Brands (AOBC  -  Free Report) and Vista Outdoor (VSTO  -  Free Report) — will not be part of these funds and products.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will be reducing expenses for funds tracking a socially responsible investing index (those already excludes these stocks) by 50% to 25 basis points.   (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Notably, following the deadly school shooting in Florida in February, several financial firms started reviewing their ties with the firearm industry and National Rifle Association. In fact, BlackRock was one of the first financial companies to go public with its intention to engage in discussion with gun makers and retailers regarding business policies and practices related to the production and sale of firearms last month.Further, in late March, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) became the first major Wall Street bank to announce changes relating to how it will conduct business with gun retailers. The bank, in an email statement, said that new policy retailers must sell firearms only to customers above 21 years of age and they must have passed a background check. Also, these retailers should not sell “bump stocks” or high-capacity magazines.Bank of America, State Street, Vanguard Group, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and Blackstone are among the companies that have spoken against the gun culture, but so far haven’t come out with similar plans. Also, U.S. public pension funds are under pressure to divest from gun manufacturers.Another Wall Street giant, Well Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), doesn’t wish to wade into gun control debate. Last month, in an interview to the Charlotte Observer, the company CEO, Tim Sloan said that he has doubts over whether banks should get more involved. Per a Bloomberg report, Well Fargo is the top financier for the gun industry.Amid all these, the comptroller of New York state’s pension funds, in a letter to nine major financial companies, have asked whether gun purchase should be classified with other risky transactions like illicit drugs and cryptocurrencies. These firms include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, First Data Corp., Worldpay Inc. and Mastercard. These companies have also been asked to evaluate and explore the cost of implementing systems that could reject purchases of firearms, ammunition or accessories.The efforts by the financial companies are commendable. These initiatives will definitely play a tremendous role in restricting unsafe gun usage. But these measures are just the beginning, there is a significant scope to do more.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2308,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) surged near the end of last year, and this momentum carried over into the early part of 2018. Then in early February, Wells Fargo saw its stock price tumble along with many other companies. Now, amid this newly volatile market, investors might be even more focused on Wells Fargo’s upcoming Q1 financial results. Wells Fargo’s very public and serious business-related scandals, including its massive fake account fiasco, caused some damage to its reputation and its stock price over the last year. These self-inflicted wounds might still taint how outsiders and investors perceive the company. But the real question is: does the perception of Wells Fargo correspond with its current first quarter earnings outlook?With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from Wells Fargo’s upcoming Q1 financial results to see if the embattled banking power seems poised to turn things around. Latest Outlook and ValuationWells Fargo’s first quarter revenues are expected to dip by 1.5% to hit $21.67 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the bank is projected to see its earnings climb by 6% to reach $1.06 per share.However, Wells Fargo’s earnings estimate revision activity has been mixed recently. The company has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions and six downward revisions, all within the last 60 days. These revisions lowered Wells Fargo’s consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents.WFC is currently trading with a Forward P/E of 10.6. This marks a discount compared to the “Banks - Major Regional” industry, which is currently trading at an average of 11.6x forward earnings.This also marks a discount compared to where Wells Fargo was trading at just a few months ago. Wells Fargo’s newly discounted valuation can be attributed, for the most part, to its recently declining stock price—which far outpaces its industry’s dip.  Most Recent ResultsWells Fargo posted adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share in the fourth quarter, which fell short of our Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for EPS of $1.04. The company reported revenues of $22.1 billion, which just missed our $22.4 billion estimate.These results are no indication of what Wells Fargo might report going forward, but they give investors some sense of how the company compared against estimates in its most recently reported quarter.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Wells Fargo’s Q1 report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteWe can see that Wells Fargo has posted relatively strong results over the last couple of years. It is also worth noting that Wells Fargo’s stock has performed somewhat inconsistently following the release of its quarterly earnings results.For instance, Wells Fargo stock surged in the immediate aftermath of an earnings miss last quarter, while its stock price sank following a second quarter earnings beat.Bottom Line Past performance does not always guarantee future success. And we can see that Wells Fargo’s price performance has been a bit harder to gauge over its recent scandal-ridden stretch.Investors should remember that the bank’s bottom line is projected to expand in the first quarter, and note that Wells Fargo is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wells Fargo is scheduled to report its first quarter 2018 financial results before markets open on Friday, April 13.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2309,WFC,"Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) gained about 2.3% on Tuesday, just a few days before it will—alongside fellow banking giants Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report)—kick off Q1 earnings season with the release of its latest quarterly financial report. Investors will want to keep a close eye on this finance bellwether in the lead up to, and aftermath of, its pivotal earnings announcement.JPM has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year, but interest rate uncertainty has created for big financials lately. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond have moved sideways over the last two months, marking a change to the uptrend in treasury yields that had been in place since September.Regardless, the Fed appears ready to continue tightening its policies, and lingering uncertainty is really related to whether the central bank will announce four rates hikes, or more, this year. Bank investors will continue to monitor this as the industry clamors for the earnings growth catalyst that is a higher benchmark borrowing rate.But investors will also need to monitor the results of JPMorgan Chase, with its interesting mix of investment and commercial banking serving as an important indicator of the finance sector’s health.Latest Outlook and ValuationBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect JPMorgan to report earnings of $2.28 per share and total revenue of $27.5 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 38.2% and 11.6%, respectively.Heading into the report, JPM is trading with a Forward P/E of 12.1, which is basically in line with the “Banks - Major Regional” industry average of 11.8. JPMorgan Chase has traded as high as 15.7x forward 12-month earnings within the past 52 weeks, and its median earnings multiple over this timeframe is about 12.7x.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that JPMorgan surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Just a few days ahead of its report, JPM is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.8%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at $2.26 per share, meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been lower than the consensus. In other words, our model is not conclusively calling for a beat.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of JPMorgan’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. JPMorgan has met or surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing nine quarters, but its bottom-line results have not always translated into upward momentum for the stock.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Over the course of JPM’s recent streak, the stock has turned positive just four times during this timeframe in each respective quarter.Want more market analysis from this author?

2310,WFC,"Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) climbed on Tuesday after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech helped alleviate some trade war fears. Clearly, avoiding a trade war would be good for Goldman, but investors will still want to look to the investment giant’s upcoming first quarter financial results in order to gauge near-term success.Despite the recent surge, the market looks like it might lean more bearish for now. Therefore, investors should focus much of their attention on Goldman’s Q1 earnings estimates to see if a bottom line beat might be in store.The reasoning here is simple: Finding stocks that are set to top earnings estimates is one of the best ways for investors to come out on top during volatile times.Q1 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Goldman’s Q1 revenues to climb by 10.7% to reach $8.89 billion.Meanwhile, Goldman’s quarterly earnings are also projected to jump over 10% to $5.67 per share. Goldman has also experienced solid earnings estimate revision activity recently, having earned four upward revisions within the last 60 days, against just one downward revision.However, these estimates don’t give investors any idea if Goldman is actually projected to top our current earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Goldman has earned one upward earnings estimate revision within the last seven days, which upped its Most Accurate Estimate for Q1 to $5.69 per share. This estimate comes in 2 cents above our current consensus estimate.Goldman is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.37%, which means investors should consider Goldman a stock that could be poised to beat Q1 earnings estimates.Goldman is expected to report its Q1 earnings results before the opening bell on Tuesday, April 17.Fellow banking powers, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are all set to report their quarterly earnings on Friday, April 13.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2311,WFC,"Per a Reuters article, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is likely to face penalty as large as $1 billion due to its wrongdoings in auto insurance and mortgage lending business by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).Brief on the Two FraudsThe San Francisco-based bank has been accused of pocketing commissions from pushing unnecessary auto policies on its customers. Per Wells Fargo's auto insurance policy terms, drivers who have borrowed money from the bank for a new vehicle, are supposed to carry a policy that would pay off the bank in case of a theft or damage. However, the bank’s employees have been blamed of forcing such policies on about 570,000 customers, who were already under coverage. Wells Fargo has blamed the third-party vendor by stating that they wrongly layered insurance policies on its auto borrowers. The bank had investigated the matter thoroughly till 2005 and found that it would have to make refunds of about $145 million to borrowers and adjust account balances by another $37 million.Regarding the mortgage lending probe, Wells Fargo was accused of charging extra fees to customers when their mortgage applications were delayed. The fees in question is rate-lock extension fees, which is supposed to be charged only when borrowers fail to submit documents on time or want to retain the interest rate that initially was quoted for the loan.However, the bank’s officials levied fees on its customers even though the delay was caused by them. Last year, Wells Fargo had announced that it will refund fees to the affected customers, after a review of the matter.CFPB Director’s Motive Behind Such Huge PenaltyCFPB’s acting director, Mick Mulvaney, is seeking to penalize the bank with an aim to duplicate the $100 million penalty that was imposed on it to settle the infamous fake accounts scandal in September 2016. The penalty, so far, is the highest the regulator has levied on a bank.Also, it reiterates President Trump’s opinions on Wells Fargo’s misdeed, which he had voiced through a tweet last December, “Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!”Road Ahead Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal, Wells Fargo has been getting involved in a number of probes. These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated.However, the bank has diligently taken remedial measures and initiatives to keep afloat. Also, lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 4.9% in six month's time versus 5.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward estimate revision of nearly 2% in the last 60 days.

2312,WFC,"Recent weeks have been dominated by escalating trade hostility between the United States and China and regulation of Big Tech. Starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts are looking for a strong Q1 earnings season, mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy signed into law last December, and robust economic growth both at home and abroad.While the highest year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be notched by energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are also expected to contribute handsomely. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season. Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price, which eventually enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts.Q1 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors are looking forward to the outset of the Q1 earnings season on Apr 12 and 13, when bigwigs like BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) will be reporting their Q1 numbers, and for the whole of S&P 500 results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump’s polices, including tax cuts and solid global economic growth. The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas.Trump’s economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate remaining at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month. The United States at the same time added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016. U.S. consumer sentiment in March, by the way, reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market.The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017, per the World Bank.Potential Gainers of Q1The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 60.3% from the same period last year on 15.6% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily backing the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q1 earnings expected to rise 41.4% on 20.2% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q1 earnings poised to be up 36.1% from the same period last year on 15.9% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 23.9% from the same period last year on 12.3% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Some analysts, in the meantime, are worried that investors will start to rotate out of the crowded tech sector this year and into other sectors that will benefit from the lower taxes. So far though, in spite of such uncertainty, the technology sector outperformed the broader S&P 500.

The bottom line improved 5.1% year over year.In addition, top-line growth was recorded. Moreover, improved credit quality was a positive factor. Further, pressure on margin eased.

Furthermore, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points year over year to 3.71%.Supported by strong growth in trust income and distribution from Bayview Lending Group LLC, the company’s other income climbed 3% year over year to $459 million. These increases were partially offset by unrealized losses on investments in equity securities.Non-interest expenses were $933 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter. Excluding certain non-operating items, non-interest operating expenses came in at $927 million, escalating 19% from the year-ago quarter. The rise reflected increased litigation reserve, elevated salaries, and employee-benefit costs and other expenses.Efficiency ratio came in at 64% this quarter, up from 56.9% in the prior-year quarter.

We believe the company, with its sturdy business model and strategic acquisitions, is well poised for growth. The Hudson City acquisition has, in all probability, provided an upside to M&T Bank’s top line by leveraging on the retail network of the former, as well as product and balance-sheet diversification.However, regulatory issues and escalating costs remain headwinds for the bank. M&T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteCurrently, M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The primary highlight was the release of the Fed minutes of the March FOMC meeting.The latest Fed minutes indicate that the officials are optimistic about the improving economic growth and rise in inflation. This is expected to support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.The release of the minutes led to overall positivity in the markets and bank stocks didn’t remain untouched. Apart from this, easing U.S.-China trade war tension cheered investors to some extent.Banks’ first-quarter earnings were also in the spotlight over the past five trading sessions. This time, earnings are expected to be impressive driven by rebound in trading activities and higher interest rates. Also, modest loan growth will likely support results.Taking about company-specific headlines, as usual Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated for all the wrong reasons. Other than that, banks continued with the restructuring efforts with an aim to expand operations and control expenses.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 6, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. For Wells Fargo, there seems to be no end to troubles.

Bank of the Ozarks, Inc.’s (OZRK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The figure also represents improvement of 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.Results primarily benefited from an improvement in net interest income, driven by higher interest rates. Also, loans and deposit balances improved, which supported results to some extent. However, higher expenses, lower non-interest income and an increase in provisions were the undermining factors.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week6 monthsJPM3.9%19.3%BAC3.4%21.4%WFC0.9%-3.3%C5.1%0.5%COF2.3%15.6%USB1.9%-4.0%PNC3.6%14.5%In the last five trading sessions, Citigroup and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) were the major gainers, with the banks’ shares gaining 5.1% and 3.9%, respectively.

2318,WFC,"Driven by top-line strength, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3% in first-quarter 2018. Earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share.Net income came in at $4.6 billion, up 12.2% year over year.Overall high revenues were reflected, driven by elevated banking, equity markets and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. However, fixed income markets revenue disappointed. Moreover, expenses escalated on ongoing investments.Citigroup’s costs of credit for the first quarter were up 12% year over year to $1.9 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.9 billion and a net loan loss reserve release of $36 million.Top-Line Strength Partly Offset by Higher ExpensesRevenues were up 3% year over year to $18.9 billion in the reported quarter. The rise highlights elevated revenues in the global consumer banking and institutional clients group, partly offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.8 billion in the quarter, up 6% year over year. Though fixed income revenues decreased 7%, higher equity markets (up 38%) and securities services revenues (up 16%) offset the fall on a year-over-year basis. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 6%.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 7% year over year to $8.4 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $591 million, tanking 51% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly underlined legacy assets runoff.Operating expenses at Citigroup were up 2% year over year to $10.9 billion. Increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.92 trillion, up 6% year over year. The company’s loans grew 7% year over year to $673 billion. Deposits increased 5% year over year to $1 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 20% year over year to $4.4 billion. The company reported a dip of 13% in consumer non-accrual loans to $2.6 billion. In addition, corporate non-accrual loans of $1.7 billion plunged 29% from the year-earlier period.Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $12.4 billion at quarter end, or 1.85% of total loans, compared with $12 billion, or 1.93%, recorded in the year-ago period.Solid Capital PositionAt the end of the reported quarter, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.1%, decreasing from 12.8% in the year-ago quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter came in at 6.7%, down from 7.3% in the year-earlier quarter.As of Mar 31, 2018, book value per share was $71.67, down 5% year over year and tangible book value per share was $61.02, down 7% from the prior-year period.Capital DeploymentDuring first-quarter 2018, Citigroup repurchased about 30 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $3.1 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also, though the bank was impacted by higher expenses and lower fixed income markets revenue. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Also, overall rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2319,WFC,"If you are an avid investor, you must also be a diehard fan of the Oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffet has consistently beaten the markets for decades by accumulating positions in some of the world’s sought-after companies. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time, while they also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Thus, let us focus on Buffet’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the first-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price. But before we do so, let us look at his top stock holdings from his darling sectors:Financials Scoops Up Top SpotBuffett has huge stakes in several financial stocks. He has, particularly, liked American Express since the 1960s. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) holds around 151.6 million shares of the credit card giant, valued at $15 billion. When it comes to banks, Berkshire has a sizeable position in Bank of America, which is nearly $20.4 billion. Buffett’s second-largest holding is America’s second most profitable bank, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Berkshire holds 452.8 million shares of Wells Fargo, which indicates that Buffett is quite optimistic about the current financial environment.A recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. But, this time around, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks).Consumer Goods Comes SecondBuffett has a sizeable position in consumer stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz. Coca-Cola is much trusted as Buffet has assured that he will never sell shares in the renowned beverage company. Berkshire held around 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, making it the company’s fourth-largest holding. Kraft Heinz is another consumer staples firm where Buffett and his company has 325.6 million shares, worth $25.3 billion.Consumer staples seems to be the safest option at a time when markets are plagued with widespread uncertainty. Trump talk of Syria bombing, unabated trade tensions, high profile departures in the Trump administration and midterm election year spell a rough phase for stocks. Staples, on the other hand, is generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the state of the larger market.Tech Takes Third SpotThe Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates, in the meantime, has already provided the much-needed windfall to computer and software makers. Any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%, per the latest tax law.The lowering of the tax rate will encourage big tech companies to bring back funds held overseas. This in turn will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and engage in M&A activities. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will make the most of the positive tax overhaul initiative by repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. It is also the most valuable holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.Industrials & Airlines in FocusBuffett has the fourth-largest stake in the Industrials sector. And why not? Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.But, Buffet has started to show keen interest in airlines which he earlier used to steer clear of. He believes that planes being more efficient and relationships between unions being better will certainly help airlines fly high. Buffett holds several airlines, but, Southwest Airlines is the most valuable.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Consider in Q1 EarningsAs mentioned above, American business magnate Warren Buffet’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. But, not all of his choices from the aforesaid sectors will report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings.We have, thus, figured out three of his top stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett particularly likes Moody’s as the company continues to post strong numbers, so there’s some real money-making potential there. The company, in the most recent quarter, declared an operating income of $462.8 million.The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on Apr 27. Moody's has an Earnings ESP of +0.85%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.9%, better than the industry’s estimated growth of 21.4%.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett favors Mastercard as an increasing number of customers are switching to cashless payments, as it is preferred by most businessmen.The company is likely to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on May 2. Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of +2.39%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 29.7%, well ahead of the industry’s projected growth of 15%.Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) is a payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities to electronic payments.Buffett likes Visa as the company has the same competitive advantages and business qualities that Mastercard possesses.Visa is expected to report earnings results for the March quarter on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.2%, above the industry’s projected growth of 15%.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

2320,WFC,"Today saw the second revision (third take) on Q4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP), among the most important metrics to follow regarding economic growth. Expectations for Q4 were to have seen a 20 basis-point rise from the previous read’s 2.5%, but the results were even stronger: 2.9% for Q4 GDP, very nearly marking the third straight quarter of 3% growth.Overall, Q4 slowed down a bit from Q3: in terms of real Gross Domestic Income (GDI), a gauge of wage growth in relation to overall economic growth, we saw a Q4 rise of 0.9% as compared to the previous quarter’s +2.4%. Averaged out between both GDP and GDI reads, Q4 reached 1.9% and Q3 was 2.8%. Real GDP for full-year 2017 arrived at 2.3%, with no further coming revisions to last year’s numbers.Recall Q1 2017 started off slowly — its initial GDP read was sub-1%, though revisions moved this higher over time — but picked up steam in a big way in Q2 and Q3. Even with a slight pullback to 2.9% in Q4 (Q3’s final read was 3.2%), economic growth is on a good trajectory. Combine this chain of three strong quarters in a row with new corporate taxes having been slashed, and Q1 prospects look pretty solid. The first report on Q1 GDP is expected April 27, 2018.That said, there is always a matter of seasonal slow-down associated with the first quarter of a new year. Most notably among estimates from various Federal Reserve entities around the country was in the Atlanta Fed reads, which had recently been ratcheted down to 1.9%. What’s notable about this is that Atlanta’s previous forecast was for an eye-popping 5.4% growth in Q1. This was an outlier at the time, and has now become one of the more conservative outlooks a month from the initial look.Elsewhere in GDP data, Consumption rose to 4.0% from 3.8% in the last previous read, the Price Index reached 2.3% and Personal Consumption Expenditures were  exactly in-line with the prior look of 1.9%. Wholesale Inventories were up a bit to 1.1%, indicating incremental increases in production.Q1 earnings season will be here before the first read on Q1 GDP, so the robust expectations for publicly traded companies will have manifested before the next GDP results are released. Expectations for Q1 are very good, although with a higher bar set, it remains to be seen whether a majority of the S&P 500 will be able to outperform. Tax cuts are currently being baked into estimates, but this is new territory.The calendar end to Q1 is tomorrow, which is shortened by a day for the Good Friday holiday. We expect earnings results from the bank majors like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).

"
2321,WFC,"In the midst of rollercoaster trading that has seen massive one-day swings in major stock indexes become commonplace, investors will now be forced to gear up for another busy stretch of earnings announcements—with the Q1 report season officially getting underway when several financial behemoths release their latest results on Friday.Major bank stocks have slightly outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year, but interest rate uncertainty has created headwinds for the space recently. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond have moved sideways over the last two months, marking a change to the uptrend in treasury yields that had been in place since September.With that said, the Fed appears poised to continue tightening its policies, with market uncertainty almost entirely related to whether the central bank will announce four rates hikes, or more, this year. News on this front will continue to influence bank stocks as investors in the space clamor for the earnings growth catalyst that is a higher interest rate.In the meantime, investors will be fixated on the latest quarterly earnings reports from the finance sector’s major bellwethers. So what should we expect from the upcoming report season? Let’s take a closer look.The 30,000-Foot ViewBased on the latest available estimates, we expect the Finance sector—of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor—to report Q1 earnings growth of 19.1% on 4.5% revenue growth. This would follow 0.6% earnings growth and 4% revenue growth in Q4.The previous earnings cycle was complicated by massive one-time charges related to tax law changes, which probably explains some of the large uptick in the growth rate. But we also know that 1Q17 saw the Finance sector report earnings growth of 10.5%, so year-over-year comparisons are not exactly soft—making a 19%+ growth rate that much more impressive.The Major Banks group is actually projected to be the slowest-growing industry within the Finance sector, although its estimate 11.1% EPS growth is certainly nothing to scoff at. Still, investors will hope that this group can get off to a great start with better-than-expected results from its top players, many of whom are reporting this Friday.First Batch of Bellwether ReportsOne key question that will be answered come Friday morning is whether a sharp uptick in market volatility has proved helpful to the markets and trading segments of the big banks. To answer this, investors will look to the reports of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report).Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect JPMorgan and Citigroup to report earnings growth of 38.2% and 19.1%, respectively. Our consensus estimates are also calling for these companies to post respective net sales growth of 11.6% and 4.5%.Meanwhile, our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file projects that JPMorgan will report total revenue of $7.1 billion in its Markets & Investor Services segment. This would represent growth of 8.9% from the year-ago period, which would mark an improvement from the double-digit declines this unit has witnessed recently. We do not have comparable estimates for Citigroup, but investors should expect markets activity to be a key catalyst there as well.Several major banks with little to no exposure to capital markets operation, including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) will also report on Friday. Our Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for these firms to report earnings growth of 7.0% and 23.5%, respectively.Bottom LineFriday’s reports come at an interesting moment for the finance sector and the market as a whole. Both the sector and the broader market are facing headwinds and catalysts, with interest rate uncertainty and trade war woes outweighing the positives recently. Nevertheless, investors could be quick to forget about these challenges if earnings results are powerful.Want more market analysis from this author?

2323,WFC,"The first-quarter earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names — JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) — all reporting financial numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September.Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter. All these activities indicate a favorable momentum on the capital markets aiding trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans, to some extent.Mortgage business is anticipated to witness a slowdown in the first quarter. With interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this source.The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt-origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to escalate. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in first-quarter 2018 are projected to rise 11.3% year over year.Let’s take a look at the four major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow.JPMorgan will report the first-quarter earnings before the opening bell. Steady rise in net interest income and slowdown in mortgage banking is expected. Investment banking income is projected to remain stable or increase marginally year over year. Furthermore, with increased volatility during the quarter, management projects first-quarter market revenues to rise at a mid-to-high single-digit rate, on a year-over-year basis. Similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are also expected to render support to the total trading revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. (Read more: Higher Trading & Rates to Support JPMorgan Q1 Earnings).Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteOn Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo, is also slated to announce results. With a Zacks Rank of 3 and Earnings ESP of +0.73%, the chances of a likely earnings beat in the quarter to be reported are bright. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Wells Fargo is likely to benefit from easing margin and high interest income, though marginally. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent. Nonetheless, mounting expenses, continual auto-loan portfolio runoff and low mortgage business are expected to dent the banking giant’s results. (Read more: Will Wells Fargo Q1 Earnings Overcome Legal Issues?).Wells Fargo posted an average beat of 0.32% over the preceding four quarters, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of them, as demonstrated in the chart below:Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteFor another big bank, Citigroup, we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat in the quarter, as higher credit costs are likely to hurt its financials. Nonetheless, the company is anticipated to witness improvement in consumer banking revenues, while pressure on margins is likely to somewhat ease. Additionally, rebound in trading revenues is expected to act as a tailwind. (Read more: Will Citigroup Q1 Earnings Benefit From Trading Rebound?).Further, this Zacks #3 Ranked stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citigroup Inc. QuoteLikewise, we cannot conclusively predict earnings beat for PNC Financial in the first quarter, with an Earnings ESP of +0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Projected higher net-interest income and consumer loan growth will likely support earnings. In addition, an increase in fee income is estimated on equity underwriting business strength. However, the company is likely to continue witnessing lower mortgage revenues owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.

2324,WFC,"Starting tomorrow, quarterly results from major banks will kick-off the first quarter earnings season. The resurgence of dormant volatility due to trade war tensions, technology industry woes and inflation will certainly drive trading revenues. A tighter rate environment will also boost net interest margins.Banks are the biggest earnings contributors of the Finance sector. The sector’s earnings outlook has notably improved as a result of tax cuts, higher interest rates, and generally favorable economic backdrop. The sector is expected to report 19.2% higher earnings on 4.5% higher revenues, which will follow the sector’s flattish performance in the preceding period. (Read: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight)Major banks reporting earnings this week include Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report). With JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Apr 13, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both of these have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Return on Assets (ROA)Examining earnings per share alone would not generate any significant insights when determining the level of profitability of a bank. Return on Assets is a ratio which reveals how efficiently a bank is utilizing its assets to generate profits.Currently, JPMorgan holds total assets of $377.3 billion while Wells Fargo has total assets of $253.2 billion. Our research shows that the average one year trailing 12-month ROA for Wells Fargo stands at 1.14%, higher than 1.05% for JPMorgan.Price PerformanceJPMorgan has lost 1.8% over the last three months, outperforming the broader industry which has declined 7.1% over the same period. Wells Fargo has dropped 17% over the same period, underperforming both the broader industry and JPMorgan. ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.76, which is below the S&P 500 average of 3.74. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.39, Wells Fargo is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though JPMorgan is also undervalued compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 1.65, it is pricier than Wells Fargo.   Dividend YieldWells Fargo’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 3%. With a dividend yield of 2.03%, JPMorgan shareholders earn lower dividend yield than both Wells Fargo and the broader industry, which has an average dividend yield of 2.06%.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, JPMorgan has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.7%. In comparison, Wells Fargo has delivered positive surprises in three of the four prior quarters with an average earnings surprise of 0.3%. But the situation changes when considering Earnings ESP values, with JPMorgan's being +0.29% and Wells Fargo’s being +0.73%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that JPMorgan holds an edge over Wells Fargo when considering price performance and a more detailed earnings history. However, Wells Fargo is superior when considering valuation, return on assets and dividend yield.Additionally, it carries an ESP reading of +0.73%, better than JPMorgan’s figure of +0.29%. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 and seem to be evenly matched but Wells Fargo is preferable ahead of earnings, since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2325,WFC,"Per a Reuters article, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) plea to fully dismiss a lawsuit which accused it of practicing discriminatory mortgage lending practices was dismissed by the U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman.BackgroundIn December 2014, Illinois' Cook County had filed a lawsuit against the bank alleging it of targeting minority borrowers in the Chicago area and violating the Fair Housing Act (FHA). Wells Fargo was charged of making them borrow loans that were too costly for them, which resulted in higher fees, frequent defaults and foreclosures. Also, the bank was accused of offering bonuses to employees who were successful in giving such loans.In the lawsuit, the county also alleged Wells Fargo of engaging in the practice of ""equity stripping"" in order to maximize the income and assets the bank could generate by originating or acquiring high-cost and other nonprime mortgage loans.In July 2017, Wells Fargo had requested the federal court at Chicago to dismiss the lawsuit saying that the county failed to show that the bank had directly caused the harms alleged in the lawsuit.Judge’s DecisionFeinerman allowed the county to pursue federal Fair Housing Act claims against Wells Fargo to the extent the bank's alleged ""equity stripping"" practices boosted the cost of administering and processing a higher number of foreclosures.Per the article, Feinerman dismissed claims alleging harm from lost property taxes, the need to combat crime and blight, racial segregation and other factors, calling them ""ripples"" that ""flow far beyond"" Wells Fargo's alleged misconduct.Also, the federal judge stated that the cities are eligible to pursue FHA claims so long as they are successful in establishing a ""direct"" link between the alleged misconduct and the resulting harm.Our TakeLegal hassles at Wells Fargo seem unlikely to end soon. Thus, legal costs are likely to hurt its bottom-line growth. However, its strong capital position and a much attentive management might keep it from landing into trouble again.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 7.4% over the past six months against 3.8% rally for the industry it belongs to. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space are Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and BankUnited (BKU  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fifth Third has been revised 1.8% upward for the current year, in the last 60 days. The company’s share price has increased 25.1% in the past year.M&T Bank has witnessed 1.2% upward earnings estimate revision for 2018, in the last 60 days. Its share price has risen 16.8% in the past year.BankUnited’s shares have gained 8.8% in a year and its earnings estimates for 2018 have moved up 1.3% in the last 60 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2326,WFC,"Last week, President Donald Trump directed the U.S. trade representative to impose tariffs on nearly $50 billion worth of imports from China.  Also, he plans to restrict new investments from the country and block Chinese takeovers of the U.S. firms. Things took an ugly turn with China planning to hit back with similar actions.With a full blown trade war expected to happen, stock markets fell sharply. Over the past week, all three major indices — the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq — fell 5.6%, 5.5% and 5.8%, respectively.Similarly, all the sectors including bank stocks didn’t remain untouched. Notably, KBW Nasdaq Bank index tanked almost 8% over the last five trading days. Big banks — JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) — lost 7.3%, 9.3%, 7.6% and 8.8%, respectively. Also, the Major Banks tanked 8.1% and Banks & Thrifts fell 7.3%.   Wondering why such a sharp fall in bank stocks, when they are not even expected to be directly hurt by the impending U.S.-China trade war? Well, before discussing the reasons for the decline, let’s first understand what led to the trade war and its implications, in brief.President Trump has frequently accused China of unfair trade practices and theft of U.S. intellectual property. Hence, following a seven-month probe into the intellectual property theft, tariffs were imposed on China.Subsequently, China announced a $3 billion list of U.S. goods that might be hit by higher tariffs. Despite the timing of the announcement, this was based on Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier in the month.Implications of Trade War & How Banks Might Be ImpactedThe move to impose higher tariff on Chinese products and steel and aluminum imports is to protect domestic industries and safeguard jobs. Also, this fulfils one of President Trump’s major election promises of lowering America's huge trade deficit.However, things could backfire.According to Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, the spike in trade tension between the U.S. and China will immediately result in an economic crisis. He further added that the U.S. companies will be at a loss if China cuts out their supply chains.This could, therefore, turn into an alarming situation as the U.S. and global economic growth may slow down. Further, this could prompt other countries to raise import barriers and depress global trade.In reality, no one wins in trade wars. Historically, imposition of higher tariffs led to slowdown in economic growth. Per the U.S. International Trade Commission, when President George W. Bush increased steel tariffs in 2002, the country’s GDP fell $30.4 million.At present, entire economic picture looks grim. This will likely disrupt central bank policy, interest rates and inflation.Of late, banks were looking forward to an improving economy, higher interest rates and benefits from lower tax rates. But with banks’ financial performance mainly tied with the country’s economy, they are expected to bear the brunt of the trade war to some extent.Slowdown in economic growth and job losses may lead the Fed to lower the pace of interest rate hikes. Further, loan demand may falter. These are likely to lead to lower revenues for banks.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2328,WFC,"Wednesday, March 28, 2018Today saw the second revision (third take) on Q4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP), among the most important metrics to follow regarding economic growth. Expectations for Q4 were to have seen a 20 basis-point rise from the previous read’s 2.5%, but the results were even stronger: 2.9% for Q4 GDP, very nearly marking the third straight quarter of 3% growth.Overall, Q4 slowed down a bit from Q3: in terms of real Gross Domestic Income (GDI), a gauge of wage growth in relation to overall economic growth, we saw a Q4 rise of 0.9% as compared to the previous quarter’s +2.4%. Averaged out between both GDP and GDI reads, Q4 reached 1.9% and Q3 was 2.8%. Real GDP for full-year 2017 arrived at 2.3%, with no further coming revisions to last year’s numbers.Recall Q1 2017 started off slowly — its initial GDP read was sub-1%, though revisions moved this higher over time — but picked up steam in a big way in Q2 and Q3. Even with a slight pullback to 2.9% in Q4 (Q3’s final read was 3.2%), economic growth is on a good trajectory. Combine this chain of three strong quarters in a row with new corporate taxes having been slashed, and Q1 prospects look pretty solid. The first report on Q1 GDP is expected April 27, 2018.That said, there is always a matter of seasonal slow-down associated with the first quarter of a new year. Most notably among estimates from various Federal Reserve entities around the country was in the Atlanta Fed reads, which had recently been ratcheted down to 1.9%. What’s notable about this is that Atlanta’s previous forecast was for an eye-popping 5.4% growth in Q1. This was an outlier at the time, and has now become one of the more conservative outlooks a month from the initial look.Elsewhere in GDP data, Consumption rose to 4.0% from 3.8% in the last previous read, the Price Index reached 2.3% and Personal Consumption Expenditures were  exactly in-line with the prior look of 1.9%. Wholesale Inventories were up a bit to 1.1%, indicating incremental increases in production.Q1 earnings season will be here before the first read on Q1 GDP, so the robust expectations for publicly traded companies will have manifested before the next GDP results are released. Expectations for Q1 are very good, although with a higher bar set, it remains to be seen whether a majority of the S&P 500 will be able to outperform. Tax cuts are currently being baked into estimates, but this is new territory.The calendar end to Q1 is tomorrow, which is shortened by a day for the Good Friday holiday. We expect earnings results from the bank majors like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).

2329,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) stock surged over 2.60% on Wednesday, despite reports that Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a critical letter to CEO Tim Sloan, questioning the embattled banking giant’s recent customer refund initiatives.Sen. Warren called out Sloan and Wells Fargo just days after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s latest wave of consumer refunds were marred by missteps. An array of mistakes—large and small—were reportedly made during the company’s effort to repay customers hurt by improper fees on car loans and home mortgages.Wells Fargo admitted last August that the company charged nearly 600,000 customers for auto insurance they didn't need and improperly charged 110,000 customers fees related to their mortgage rates. This comes on top of Wells Fargo’s massive fake account scandal that forced the bank’s previous CEO to step down in the fall of 2016.In her Feb. 13 letter, Sen. Warren posed nearly a dozen questions and accused Wells Fargo’s current CEO of breaking his promise to customers. However, the bank also received some praise from one of its biggest investors in the wake of Sen. Warren’s letter.Berkshire Backing Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A - (BRK.B  -  Free Report) vice chairman, Charlie Munger, supported Wells Fargo on Wednesday while he spoke at the Daily Journal Corporation’s  annual meeting in Los Angeles.“Of course, Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction,” Munger said at the meeting. “Of course, they were too slow in reacting to the bad news when it came. Everyone makes those mistakes, but we make fewer than others.”Munger went on to say that it’s “time for the regulators to let up on Wells Fargo” and that long-term the bank and its customers will likely be better off. It seems clear that the Berkshire executive thinks punishments levied against the company have been more than fair.Wells Fargo fired more than 5,000 employees in relation to its initial fraudulent account scandal and was also fined $185 million. More recently, in one of her final acts as head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen and regulators notified Wells Fargo that is could not grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in total assets it ended 2017 with ""until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.""As one of Warren Buffett’s right-hand men, what Munger says can carry significant weight. But it is unclear if federal regulators will care about what he has to say, as Wells Fargo was Berkshire’s top holding as of its most recent SEC filing. Berkshire owns roughly $27.5 billion worth of Wells Fargo shares.Wells Fargo, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has seen its stock price surge over the fast few days, even before today’s climb.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk.

2330,WFC,"Stock market correction seems to be in the offing as over the last five trading days extreme volatility was witnessed. The banking stocks are not untouched by this.It all started last Friday when January job and wage data was released. Needless to say, wages grew at the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Though this indicates an improving economy, it raised fears of rise in inflation, in turn, reinforcing assumptions of a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Additionally, a two-year budget deal announced by top senators will likely further strengthen the economy, thus giving the Fed all the more reason to raise rates. This also drove up the bond yields.While indications of an improving economy and expectations for a more hawkish Fed stance are beneficial for banks on the whole, overall markets seem to be wary of such a scenario.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Its business mishandlings continue to hurt.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jan 29, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Issues related to past misconducts continue to haunt Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve punished the lender with new sanctions for the recently-revealed malpractices and fake accounts scandal which came into the limelight in September 2016. The bank has been ordered to replace four board directors and not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).

2331,WFC,"After a promising start to 2018, major stock indexes forfeited their yearly gains over the past few weeks amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war between the U.S. and China. Now, as investors look to rebound from what has been a tough stretch for many, it could prove prudent to dig deep into the tried-and-true strategies of Wall Street’s top figures.One of those top performers is, of course, the legendary Warren Buffett. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his decades of success, Buffett has amassed billions of dollars through a meticulous brand of value investing that touts patience and confidence. Simply put, Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) firm are icons of the investing world.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. This portfolio is tracked by a large swath of investors looking to mimic the success of Berkshire’s legendary CEO.But not even Berkshire Hathaway has made it through 2018’s early volatility unscathed, and with most of the public lacking the patience of Buffett, some followers of the portfolio might consider ditching some of its worst-performing stocks. Let’s take a closer look.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report)Commercial banking giant Wells Fargo has been marred by a fraudulent account scandal that tracked back to upper management, calling the company’s business practices into question and damaging its public reputation. More recently, interest rate uncertainty has caused headwinds for the finance sector. Shares of WFC have slipped more than 13% so this year, lagging the S&P 500’s nearly 2% drop.Buffett has been forced to publicly defend Wells Fargo at times, with the bank remaining one of Berkshire’s largest holdings. On top of that, Wells Fargo has underperformed from an earnings standpoint, missing consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter and inspiring a significant selloff.The company has an opportunity to turn things around with its new report on Friday. Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting that Wells Fargo will post earnings growth of 7%, but revenue is expected to be down year over year and could add more pressure to the situation.Still, earnings estimates have trended slightly higher throughout the quarter, indicating that the company’s fortunes could be improving. WFC is holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) heading into its report date. Meanwhile, shares are trading at just 10.9x forward 12-month earnings, which is a discount to the stock’s median Forward P/E of 12.5 displayed over the past year.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)Kraft Heinz remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, but the stock has underperformed amid a continued shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. The stock has tumbled more than 21% so far this year, and shares are hovering just above their 52-week low.These headwinds are putting pressure on Kraft’s earnings outlook. Within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed seven revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. Analysts now expect the company to post earnings growth of 8% on net sales growth of 1%.This negative estimate revision activity has earned KHC a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Still, the Zacks Rank is only designed to be a one- to three-month indicator, and Kraft’s dividend yield of 4.1% is likely to keep buy-and-hold investors on board.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)Southwest was one of Berkshire’s 10-largest holdings at the end of 2017, followed shortly by fellow airline company Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report). Unfortunately, industry-wide headwinds—including lower-than-expected demand for spring travel—have punished these stocks. Heading into the day, LUV was down more than 17% on a year-to-date basis.Management has a bearish view on unit revenues for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile to be flat, down from the previous forecast of growth between 1% and 2% from the prior-year quarter.This negative outlook has put a damper on analyst sentiment for Southwest. Over the past two months, LUV has witnessed six negative revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement among revising analysts. This negative revision activity has given the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more market analysis from this author?

2332,WFC,"Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), recently affirmed all the ratings of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The Wall Street biggie’s long-term deposit rating has been affirmed at A2, senior debt rating at Aa2 and subordinated debt rating at Aa3. The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is Aa1(cr)/Prime-1(cr). The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa1/Prime-1 and a stand-alone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been downgraded to “negative” from “stable”.Rationale Behind the DowngradeFollowing the consent order by the Federal Reserve which puts a cap on increasing assets beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017) for Wells Fargo, Moody’s downgraded the bank’s rating outlook to negative from stable.It has been more than a year since the news of the banking giant’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Moreover, the recent move by the Fed has increased reputational headwinds for the bank which might result in more customer attrition impacting financial performance and credit metrics. Therefore, the rating firm downgraded the outlook to negative.The allegation led to many setbacks involving the bank’s shattered image, numerous lawsuits, triggered federal and state investigations, congressional hearings and the bank’s former CEO — John Stumpf — losing his job. Further, suspension of business relations of the bank with states, including Illinois and California, were noted.Thus, post scandal, the bank undertook a number of steps to restore its reputation. It initiated an internal probe and hired a consultant to review its sales practices. Additionally, management proposed to eliminate sales goals for its retail banking business earlier than planned.According to Moody’s, Wells Fargo implemented aggressive sales strategies without proper risk-management practices and governance which resulted in the sales scandal. The rating firm expects the compliance and operational risk-management program of the bank will be improved going forward as required by the Fed. Therefore, future assessments of Moody’s of the bank’s corporate governance will depend upon the effectiveness of the bank in carrying out the initiatives for improvement.    Further, on the Fed’s approval, Wells Fargo will appoint independent third-parties to conduct the review of its processes and submit the results by Sep 30, 2018. The outcome of evaluation of such review by the Fed will decide the removal of recent sanctions on the bank.Ratings AffirmationMoody’s affirmed Wells Fargo's ratings on expectations of the bank’s strong credit metrics and liquidity position. Despite litigation issues, the company’s asset quality and capital ratios have marked improvement. In addition, profitability metrics are on an upswing, aided by lower tax rate and controlled expenses.ConclusionCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. Also, the recent assets cap put on the bank by the Fed has disappointed investors. Therefore, it is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s year-to-date performance reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.6%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 0.5%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderComerica (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2333,WFC,"We are seeing pre-market trading slightly in the red to start a new week of trading, but this is to be expected — it’s not often we see the Dow climb 577 points like we did last week, not even in this exuberant bull market rally that began more than a year ago. Not even a disappointing headline on non-farm payrolls last Friday could quell the animal spirits; drilling down into the numbers uncovered continued labor market strength.This is the best yearly start to the stock market since 2006 — well ahead of the market bubble that cratered into the Great Recession. That said, we are only one week in, with obviously plenty yet to unpack. But most of what we know is to come for the markets — tax cuts, deregulation, possible infrastructure spending — is expected to be very good for stocks.The good news did not stop there. Quoting stronger-than-expected holiday sales at lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report), the company upped its guidance forecast. As a result, shares of the specialty retailer have pushed up another 3% in early trading, to an all-time high of $81.80 per share.Later this week, we will begin to see Q4 earnings results from the big banks — now the “official” start of earnings season, although we have already seen some companies of consequence bring forward their quarterly totals in late December — such as JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). Longer term, we expect the banks to be among the biggest beneficiaries of interest rate hikes by the Fed. But in the near term, articulated by Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian, we foresee choppiness on the horizon: Q4 Bank Earnings Will Be Messy & NoisyOnce Q4 earnings season really gets going next week and through most of January, we’ll have a better idea of how strong our economy is shaping up. Expect tax cuts to bring positive adjustments to many companies’ bottom lines. The question will be: to what extent are these gains currently priced in?
"
2334,WFC,"The Q1 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the major bank results, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports affected the stock market rally in the quarter.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, as seen in both February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax law reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.Therefore, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector'stotal earnings) are projected to witness 11.1% year-over-year jump in earnings in the quarter to be reported. This comes in higher than 2.7% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article.)The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Expense reduction, which has helped banks to remain profitable, is not expected to be a major support, as banks have already slashed the majority of unnecessary expenses. While the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWith the upcoming results likely to be impressive, there are a few major banks that are expected to stand out this earnings season. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

2335,WFC,"Sorry for the delay on this report. Technical difficulties caused it to be published after the bell today. It won’t happen again…As we await the dawning of a new earnings season — Q1 begins in earnest with big banks like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) reporting late this week into early next. Numbers are expected to continue to improve, both on general economic traction and the huge windfall of corporate tax cuts gracing the bottom lines. But much of these fortunes have already been baked into expectations, so quarterly results are hotly anticipated once again.Ahead of today’s opening bell, we saw new Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers hit the tape. Results were cooler than yesterday’s Producer Price Index (PPI) results, but in-line with expectations: -0.1% on the headline, +0.2% on the core.

2336,WFC,"Wednesday, April 11, 2018Sorry for the delay on this report. Technical difficulties caused it to be published after the bell today. It won’t happen again…As we await the dawning of a new earnings season — Q1 begins in earnest with big banks like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) reporting late this week into early next. Numbers are expected to continue to improve, both on general economic traction and the huge windfall of corporate tax cuts gracing the bottom lines. But much of these fortunes have already been baked into expectations, so quarterly results are hotly anticipated once again.Ahead of today’s opening bell, we saw new Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers hit the tape. Results were cooler than yesterday’s Producer Price Index (PPI) results, but in-line with expectations: -0.1% on the headline, +0.2% on the core. PPI headline reached 0.3%, well ahead of the +0.1% expected. So with the other shoe dropping, what we see is resilient — if not exactly spectacular — pricing on both sides. This keeps in line with the Goldilocks scenario the economy has enjoyed for a while now.Markets are selling off a bit at the open today, but this follows a big leg-up Tuesday as the relief that a trade war with China may not transpire after all was pretty much palpable.

2337,WFC,"Monday, January 8, 2018We are seeing pre-market trading slightly in the red to start a new week of trading, but this is to be expected — it’s not often we see the Dow climb 577 points like we did last week, not even in this exuberant bull market rally that began more than a year ago. Not even a disappointing headline on non-farm payrolls last Friday could quell the animal spirits; drilling down into the numbers uncovered continued labor market strength.This is the best yearly start to the stock market since 2006 — well ahead of the market bubble that cratered into the Great Recession. That said, we are only one week in, with obviously plenty yet to unpack. But most of what we know is to come for the markets — tax cuts, deregulation, possible infrastructure spending — is expected to be very good for stocks.The good news did not stop there. Quoting stronger-than-expected holiday sales at lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report), the company upped its guidance forecast. As a result, shares of the specialty retailer have pushed up another 3% in early trading, to an all-time high of $81.80 per share.Later this week, we will begin to see Q4 earnings results from the big banks — now the “official” start of earnings season, although we have already seen some companies of consequence bring forward their quarterly totals in late December — such as JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). Longer term, we expect the banks to be among the biggest beneficiaries of interest rate hikes by the Fed. But in the near term, articulated by Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian, we foresee choppiness on the horizon: Q4 Bank Earnings Will Be Messy & NoisyOnce Q4 earnings season really gets going next week and through most of January, we’ll have a better idea of how strong our economy is shaping up. Expect tax cuts to bring positive adjustments to many companies’ bottom lines. The question will be: to what extent are these gains currently priced in?Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2338,WFC,"With the Dow breezing past the 25,000 milestone, President Trump believes even 30,000 is possible. The blue-chip index has relentlessly soared to record highs in the past year and has nearly quadrupled in value from the financial crisis in 2009. Enthusiasm over the Republican-led tax cut, which can boost corporate profits this year, and a series of strong economic reports helped the index move north by leaps and bounds.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks seems tempting at the moment. Such companies are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Bursts through the 25,000 Point MarkThe Dow kicked off 2018 with sizeable gains. The 30-stock index topped the coveted 25,000 mark and notched its biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec 1, 2017. It just took 35 calendar days for the Dow to jump from 24,000 to 25,000, its fastest 1,000-point climb.The Dow has now extended its last year’s gain of 25%, helping the Bull Run that began in 2009, to post its second-longest run in Wall Street history. In fact, the index hit 71 record closing highs last year, the highest since the blue-chip index’s creation in 1896.Several gurus, who until recently called for a stock market correction, are now turning super bullish. They are predicting the Dow to hit 30,000 in the near term. Also, Trump said, “I guess our new number is 30,000.” He has already taken credit for Dow 25,000 and has become the first ever President in the history to have spoken so much about the U.S. equity market.Is Dow 30,000 Possible in Trump’s First Term?The recent tax code overhaul and a strengthening economy could certainly help the Dow breeze past 30,000 and help American blue-chip companies make more money.Republican-Backed Tax Package Republicans efficaciously defied opposition from Democrats to pass the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code that will trim corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue-chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back overseas cash pile will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. The tax bill, in the meanwhile, will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. This in turn will increase discretionary income that may give a boost to the demand for consumer goods and services (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Strong Economic GrowthU.S. manufacturing surged in December, touching the second-highest reading of 2017. Increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricane and a general uptick in the economy gave a boost to manufacturing activities. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.Economic recovery worldwide also gave a boost to profitability of American blue-chip companies, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Some pessimists may argue that job addition numbers last month came in below expectations. However, the average over the past few months continues to show that the labor market remains strong, while workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from Dec 2016 to Dec 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month. The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will result in inching employees wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Ride Dow’s Stellar RunThanks to the aforesaid bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks. This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of this bullish run. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

JPM has move just about 4% higher over the last four weeks, and the stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2340,WFC,"Markets managed to maintain last year’s momentum on the third trading day of this year following solid job additions in U.S. private sector and significant rise in business activity in China and Europe.

The blue-chip index registered its fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896. Also, the 30-stock index posted 1,000-point increase five times in 2017 on the back of Trump’s pro-growth economic policies, upbeat economic data and strong corporate earnings.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.6%, or 152.24 points to close at 25,075.13. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close at 2,723.99. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,077.92, gaining 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 0.6% to close at 9.10.

(ADP  -  Free Report). This was also quite better than November’s revised number of 185,000.Coming to earnings, the exact earnings impact of the tax legislation will become clear once it is signed into law, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.7%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation.

2341,WFC,"Monday continued the losses seen last Friday, as the Dow Jones plunged 4.6%, or over 1,100 points, to sit at 24,345.75, and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively. The Dow was down 1,500 points at one point during late-afternoon trading, and today marks the worst single-day point drop ever for the widely-watched index.The VIX, an index which many investors look to in order to gauge market volatility, reached an astounding 35.02, up over 100%, at market close. This marks the largest one-day percentage increase ever for the index.Fingers are pointing to a few things for this latest market decline. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released strong wage data, with unemployment remaining steady at 4.1% and 200,000 new jobs created last month. However, this good news had markets bracing for a potentially aggressive hike in interest rates from the Federal Reserve in the next year.Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield to hit a four-year high on Friday to 2.85% after it fell to a record low just 18 months ago. Today, the 10-year closed near 2.73%Overall, it looks like the major indexes have hit the restart button on 2018 after a hot start. The S&P 500, in particular, is now down about flat on the year after reaching an all-time high last month, erasing all of its gains and breaking below its 50-day moving average.Earlier in the day, after opening in the red, the market managed to gain back some of its losses and settle back into green territory, but that was only for a brief moment.Some of the biggest stock movers in the Dow included oil giants ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), which ended the day down 5.7% and about 5%. Top decliners in the S&P 500 included Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report).The tech-heavy Nasdaq, an index which has still managed to keep some gains this year thanks to a great January, saw companies like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Vodafone (VOD  -  Free Report), and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) slip 8.49%, 6.25%, and 6.57%, respectively, at market close.Today’s dramatic stock market activity even caught the attention of the White House, and in a statement, the Trump administration said that “We’re always concerned when the market loses any value, but we’re also confident in the economy’s fundamentals.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2342,WFC,"Issues related to past misconducts continue for Wall Street biggie Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). On Friday, Federal Reserve chairperson — Janet Yellen — punished the lender with new sanctions for the recently-revealed malpractices and fake accounts scandal which came into the limelight in September 2016.The Federal Reserve has ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). Notably, Wells Fargo has been instructed to substitute three directors by April, and the fourth by the end of 2018.“We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo requires the firm to improve its governance and risk management processes, including strengthening the effectiveness of oversight by its board of directors,” Janet Yellen said in a statement. “The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers”, she further noted.Therefore, the Fed’s recent action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees. Notably, it is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve, however, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.As a consequence of the consent order which puts a cap on increasing assets, Wells Fargo estimates its profit in 2018 to be cut down by $300-$400 million. Further, the bank will submit a plan within 60 days to the regulators, including the compliance and operational risk management program of improvement. On the Fed’s approval, Wells Fargo will appoint independent third-parties to conduct the review of its processes and submit the results by Sep 30, 2018.It has been more than a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring. The disclosures by Wells Fargo revealed to have identified an additional 1.4 million of fake accounts apart from the 2.1 million accounts reported in September 2016.Currently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past year reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 13.3%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 24.9%. While the current crisis at Wells Fargo will take some time to alleviate, the company’s solid capital position, growing loans and deposits, and improving credit quality position it well for growth. Furthermore, the positive outcome of the recent move is likely to help this San Francisco-based bank regain its customers’ trust.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderJPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days. Over the past year, the company’s share price has been up more than 31.7%. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

2343,WFC,"The Federal Reserve announced the first rate hike of 2018 at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday, under Chairman Jerome Powell’s debut meeting. The Fed was tempted by the strengthening economy, optimism on reaching the inflation target this year and impressive labor market gains.The benchmark federal funds rate has been hiked to 1.50-1.75% from the 1.25-1.50% raised in December 2017. Notably, this is the sixth increase in interest rates since the financial crisis, which led the Fed to lower rates to nearly zero.“The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,” the policy-setting FOMC stated on Wednesday in Washington. Officials repeated the previous language that they anticipate “further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.”Policymakers increased their expectations for economic growth and continued with their projections of total three hikes in 2018. Furthermore, they increased their projection to three hikes in 2019 from the two forecasted in the December meeting.The central bank projects economic growth at the rate of 2.7% in 2018, up from the previous expectation of 2.5%, attributed to the encouraging U.S. consumer confidence. Further, growth rate is anticipated to be 2.4% in 2019 — moderately higher than the December forecast of 2.1%.“The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer running goal,” Powell stated in a press conference.Additionally, based on the updated economic projections, Fed expects inflation to be at 1.9% this year, near about its target of 2%. The unemployment rate in 2018 is predicted to fall to 3.8%, down from the prior forecast of 3.9%. Also, it is estimated to decline to 3.6% in 2019, again down from the previous projection of 3.9%.“Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,” the FOMC said. The statement noted that household spending and business investment “have moderated” from impressive fourth-quarter readings.With decent economic growth, balanced near-term risks to economic outlook and recent strong gains in the labor market, rate hike is an added advantage for banks. Moreover, temporary concerns over inflation are expected to be subdued.Following the interest rate-hike announcement, most Wall Street biggies, including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), increased their prime lending rate to 4.75%, effective Mar 22, 2018.Notably, PNC Financial and BofA, Zacks #3 (Hold)-ranked players, highlight their optimism on the banks’ bright future prospects, with shares rising 10.1% and 8%, respectively, year to date.

2344,WFC,"President Trump recently addressed the Congress in his first State of the Union speech. He emphasized on the achievements made during the first year in office as well as spoke about future priorities. While his business tax cuts boosted small business confidence, regulatory changes worked wonders for banks.He also said that it’s time to address the nation’s “crumbling infrastructure” and urged the Congress to increase defense spending to build up nuclear arsenal. Hence, it seems sensible to invest in these areas that can make the most of Trump’s presidency.Small Business Confidence at All-Time HighTrump has promised a “new American moment” in the address. The President claimed that his business-friendly policies helped the economy grow at a steady clip amid geopolitical concerns and raging scandal over Russia’s meddling with US presidential election. He added that “there has never been a better time to start living the American dream” and called for harmony between Republicans and Democrats.Trump said that the individual tax cuts will provide relief to the middle class, while slashing business tax rate will eventually make American companies more competitive. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019. Small business houses are already benefitting from the tax cut optimism, with small business confidence currently at an all-time high.As per the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the Small Business Optimism Index’s average monthly level came in at 104.8 last year, the highest in the history of the survey. Juanita Duggan, the president and CEO of the NFIB, did claim that increased optimism on massive tax cuts helped small business confidence hit a record high.More or less three in four Americans approved Trump’s State of the Union address, according to the CBS news poll. At the same time, investors kept an eye on the President’s remarks on financial deregulation, and defense and infrastructure spending.Banks to Gain From Deregulation & Tax CutsIn his State of the Union address, Trump boasted his administration’s approach toward deregulation as one of his major achievements. The President said that “in our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country.”Much of the recent rally in banks stemmed from hopes for government deregulation of the industry. After all, banks have outperformed the broader market since Trump’s election, with Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) almost doubling in that time. Thanks to his deregulation speech, such gains are likely to be maintained in the near future.Deregulation will free up banks by giving more power to banking authorities and spurring lending activities. Lest we forget, corporate tax cuts will increase bank’s profitability as they face high tax burden. As per KBW estimates, banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to nearly 20%.Trump Urges Congress to Boost Defense SpendingTrump has called on Congress to put an end to caps on defense spending so that the United States can modernize its nuclear arsenal. He said that better nuclear weapons are required to counter rogue organizations, terror outfits and countries such as China and Russia. His administration, in the meantime, is coming up with a new strategy to improve the country’s missiles, nuclear bombers and submarines.Modernization of nuclear arsenal will result in a cost of more than $1 trillion over the next 30 years, something that bodes well for aerospace and defense stocks. Trump has pledged to seek a $54-billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems.Trump Calls for Higher Infrastructure OutlaysTrump has also urged for huge infrastructure spending. He wants to rebuild disintegrating infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and railways. This is something that he has been promising since his campaign days.He wants the Congress to pass a legislation to stimulate a minimum of $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure outlays. He wants the approval process to reduce to two years if not one. Researchers in McKinsey & Company have figured out that such an amount will indeed be needed to fix the country’s infrastructure needs. The American Society of Civil Engineers, however, raises the amount to $2 trillion. Nevertheless, Trump’s infrastructure plan will certainly boost the nation’s builders.Top 5 GainersTrump’s State of the Union speech focused on rebuilding infrastructure, increasing defense outlays, deregulating banking norms and raising small business confidence by implementing tax cuts.

2348,WFC,"By all measures, 2017 was a stellar year for U.S. stocks, with the Dow hitting several record highs and the S&P 500 closing at an eye-popping level of 2,700.  But, will the smooth sail continue this year? Wall Street’s bulls believe that sweeping tax cuts by the Republican-led Congress will add up to bigger profits and larger stock gains this year. The market is also expected to continue its winning streak banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers. Needless to say, the economy is on track to see the fastest expansion in decades. And it has successfully unloaded some of the baggage that had slowed it down since the Great Recession in 2009.As many of the supportive conditions that boosted the market in 2017 are likely to stay in 2018, investing in multibaggers seems judicious. These stocks will make most of the bull run, courtesy of strong fundamentals and businesses that can multiply in a short span of time. After all, these stocks have seen their prices increase multiple times their initial investment values.Markets Pin Hopes on Another Banner YearIn 2017, the Dow gained 25.1% after hitting 71 record closing highs, the highest since the blue-chip index’s creation in 1896. The S&P 500 added 19.4%, while the Nasdaq outperformed both with a 29% gain. The tech-heavy index moved north for the sixth straight year — its longest streak since the one that lasted from 1975 to 1980, per WSJ Market Data Group. In fact, all the three major bourses recorded the best year since 2013.The most optimistic stock strategist further says that U.S. stocks will post sizeable returns this year as well. While some expect the Dow to hit 30,000, Tony Dwyer, the chief market strategist at New York financial firm Canaccord Genuity, raised 2018 year-end target for the S&P 500 to 3,100, up from an earlier projection of 2,800. This will mark a return of almost 16% higher than its current level of around 2,680.So, what’s driving such bullish sentiments?Landmark Tax BillPresident Trump’s tax cut had lifted optimism about corporate earnings, prompting many analysts to raise their forecast for business profits. The House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019.Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Americans Upbeat About EconomyConsumers, in the meanwhile, have stepped into the new year with confidence. The minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States, according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project. This will result in inching employees wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.” Jobless rate is already at its lowest since 2000 and job openings are abundant too.A very strong job market fueled consumer confidence. As per the Conference Board, consumer confidence continues to hover near the 17-year high set in November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.” Diversified financial services company, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.5 Multibaggers to Watch Out For in 2018The Republican tax-cut plan, recently signed into law by Trump, uptick in minimum wage, consumers planning to make big-ticket purchases and a strengthening economy call for investing in multibaggers. These stocks will cash in on such positive developments and give returns that are several times their cost. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.92-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Market volatility isn’t roaring back either, with 2017 being the calmest for stocks since 1964. The so-called “fear gauge”, CBOE Volatility Index traded at 9.98, substantially lower than its long-term average of 20. What Drove Banks Higher?Banks contributed towards much of the equity market’s gains. As bond yields perked up, bank stocks gained traction as it enables them to charge higher interest rates on loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.43% from 2.41% late Wednesday.Long-awaited tax cuts also provided a big boost to banks. Jubilant Republicans has passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Such long awaited tax cuts boosted big banks as they have been paying heavy taxes.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As widely expected, the Federal Reserve too raised short-term interest rates for the third time this year and projects three more hikes next year on a strengthening economy. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Stocks That Made HeadlinesJ.B.

2350,WFC,"Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) chief executive officer (CEO) — Tim Sloan — received about 36% pay hike in his total compensation package for 2017. His annual salary has been increased to $17.4 million in the year from $12.8 million in 2016, according to a proxy filing.The CEO’s package includes a salary of $2.4 million as base pay and restricted stock worth $15 million. Per the filing, Sloan has not been awarded cash bonus on his recommendations based on Wells Fargo’s “significant but incomplete progress on addressing compliance and operational risk-management issues.”Notably, 2017 was the first full year as CEO for Sloan. He succeeded John Stumpf in October 2016, when Stumpf stepped down in the wake of public and political outrage concerning the sales scam which surfaced in September 2016 related to 3.5 million accounts.For months, the banking giant has been caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices. It is more than a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $190 million, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring.Further, the Federal Reserve’s recent action of restricting the bank’s asset growth underlines poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees. Notably, it is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve. However, the bank is allowed to continue with its current banking activities.In the filing, Sloan’s pay package was justified with the fact that the company is performing well under the reign of the present CEO and that the compensation is well deserved. In 2017, Wells Fargo notched a profit of $22.2 billion, up 1.4% from 2016.Notably, the company's share price appreciated roughly 10.6% in 2017, underperforming 19.3% growth registered by the industry, following a slight decline in 2016.Among other banking giants, Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) chairman as well as CEO — Brian Moynihan — is expected to receive $23 million as total compensation for 2017, which reflects a rise of 15% year over year. Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) CEO — Michael Corbat — received about 48% pay hike in his total compensation package. In addition, JPMorgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) increased the CEOs’ compensation.While the current crisis at Wells Fargo will take some time to alleviate, the company’s solid capital position, growing loans and deposits, and improving credit quality position it well for growth. We believe, over the long term, Wells Fargo will remain comfortably positioned to benefit from a recovering economy, given its diverse geographic mix. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and restructuring moves will likely help the company expand its business and improve profitability.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2351,WFC,"In this era of digitalization, banking giant — Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) — has officially initiated cardless technology at more than 2,500 ATMs in 10 states. This new technology will allow customers to use ATMs without physical debit cards.Notably, customers need to log into their Fifth Third mobile app and select an account which will provide the Cardless menu option, and allow the app to access the mobile’s camera. Therefore, in an ATM, just tapping the screen generates a code which can be scanned using the phone’s camera. With this, the debit or ATM card Personal Identification Number (PIN) will enable customers to access the ATM.“Our customers are continuing to engage more actively on mobile apps and still use ATMS,” Fifth Third chief digital officer Melissa Stevens stated. “We wanted to find a way to connect those better,” added Stevens.Notably, Fifth Third recorded 40% rise in logins on its mobile app in 2017. Thus, per Stevens, cardless technology is a convenient way through the app for banking services.Among others, Charlotte-based Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) has also incorporated cardless technology into its ATMs. In 2016, this Wall Street biggie rolled out 8,000 cardless ATMs. Later, the bank added 500 ATMs. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also integrated cardless technology into its 13,000 ATMs in 2017. Apart from BofA and Wells Fargo, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is also headed toward rolling out cardless ATMs.This apart, BofA and JPMorgan intend to incorporate additional features like pre-setting ATM transactions, which will not only help customers save time, but also lower security concerns owing to shorter duration.Why this Change to Digitalization?Customers have been increasingly using smart phones for financial transactions. Further, banks have been witnessing tremendous growth in the number of active mobile users. Hence, in order to capitalize on this trend, banks are rolling out the cardless ATM technology. In addition, this is in sync with the industry-wide focus on right sizing branch networks and enhancing customer satisfaction.Introduction of digital technology remains cost effective for banks as well. Additionally, increasing competition from financial technology firms (FinTech) is driving banks to digitize their operations.Therefore, banks are trying all possible ways to enhance customer experience, reduce expenses and improve profitability.Currently, Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Fifth Third gained 26.8% over the last six months, outperforming 19.1% growth recorded by the industry.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2352,WFC,"For Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), sky is the limit. Being one of the biggest companies in the United States, the sheer possibility of its entry into a particular industry can make the existing participants feel threatened.Already this e-commerce behemoth has its presence in almost every aspect of people’s life. This includes traditional, brick-and-mortar retailing, reading or listening to books (Kindle), streaming music and videos (Prime Instant Video and Amazon Originals), web storage and computing services and shipping.  Further, the company has Prime rewards credit card from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Store card from Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report). Also, it has entered the health insurance business in January 2018 with its partnership with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report). Even there are reports that the company is looking to get into pharma and home furnishing industries.It looks like nothing is left untouched by Amazon. So, Amazon’s entry in to the banking industry shouldn’t be a big surprise.Amazon in Partnership with JPMorgan to Enter Banking?Early last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is in talks with JPMorgan to develop “checking-account-like” product for its millennial consumers. The partnership may include the ability to pay bills and/or access the bank’s ATM network. Such a deal could unite the country’s biggest e-commerce platform with the largest bank of the nation.While the discussions are at an early stage, this represents Amazon’s further foray into traditional brick-and-mortar banks, mainly dominated by big lenders. The company already offers loans in the range of $1,000 to $750,000 to small businesses through its Marketplace platform and has originated more than $3 billion loans since the launch in 2011.Amazon’s primary goal seems to be able to carter to young and underbanked consumers, who otherwise find it difficult to shop online. The partnership will also enable it to further grow its Prime membership via cross-selling to current JPMorgan clients. These will likely spur more online sales.The other advantage is not facing regulatory barriers. It’s known that the banking industry is highly regulated. So, for Amazon, partnership with JPMorgan will likely do away with regulatory compliance.Amazon Advantage: Survey Supports Amazon's EntryA survey by Bain & Company recently revealed that U.S. and U.K. customers ranked Amazon almost as high as traditional banks in terms of trusting with their money. It disclosed that more than 50% of the U.S. respondents are ready to purchase a financial product from an established tech company, with Amazon at the top of the list, followed by Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Google.With almost double the market capitalization (roughly $770 billion) of the country’s largest bank (JPMorgan has a market cap of roughly $400 billion) Amazon will likely be a success in the banking industry driven by the following advantages:1. Established brand and excellent service provider (no big data breach till now)2. Knows all about its customers’ income and spending habits3. Digital relationship with customers will be helpful in avoiding client acquisition cost4. No branch and contact center network required5. Easy payment options6. Global reach7. Huge customer data base will be useful in offering other financial products eventuallyEntry of tech companies in the financial services industry is already happening in Asia. China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) financial affiliate Ant Financial has witnessed tremendous growth over the last couple of years. Similarly, Japan’s e-commerce company Rakuten operates the country’s one of the largest credit card firms by transaction value.Therefore, Amazon can definitely amaze us with its entry into the banking industry.This is a surprise for traditional banks that till now thought small fintech startups as a big threat to their market share. But tech companies are a bigger threat.Amazon’s Entry Disruptive to Banks’ Market Share?Amazon’s entry in to banking sector will not be as easy as it seems on the paper. The Bank Holding Company Act prevents commercial companies from also getting into banking activities.While the U.S. policymakers are skeptical about the entry of a commercial company into the banking industry, this may change with time. Last year, at a conference, Keith Noreika, the temporary head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, stated that it’s time to re-consider whether separation should be maintained between traditional banks and retail firms.Bain & Company believes that over the next five years, Amazon’s banking services will likely attract more than 70 million customers, making it the third largest bank in the United States and surpassing Well Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) banking client base. Therefore, Amazon’s entry into traditional banking domain will definitely have an adverse impact on banks’ market share.As customers are getting more comfortable with the use of digital technology (online and mobile banking), banks must gear up and improve their digital offerings to counter tech firms’ incursion into their turf. While banks have started making efforts on this front, those initiatives are still in a nascent stage.Therefore, to counter Amazon and other tech companies, banks need to catch up and fill the lag at a faster pace. Instead of pushing products to the clients, banks need to put the customers first and make major changes about how to carter to requirements of millennials.So, it’s not the time for banks to panic. They can counter tech firms’ entry as they are in the business for quite long and know the nitty and gritty of it. Only they need to catch up with the customers’ needs.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

2353,WFC,"The financial sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. With President Donald Trump passing the tax reform as law last week, analysts are highly optimistic about the financial sector’s performance going into 2018. Moreover, economic fundamentals and political optimism has also led to the recent rally in the sector.Cause for AppealRepublican leaders unveiled a $1.5 trillion tax reform plan aimed at reducing taxes for the corporate and individuals. After the tax reform was passed in the Senate with a 51-48 majority, it was sent to the House for a second vote owing to some technical issues. The bill was passed by the House with a 224-201 majority and was later signed by Trump, delivering the most sweeping tax overhaul in more than 30 years.Trump received his first major legislative victory since he took office. The Financial sector is expected to derive huge benefit from the tax reform, as the corporate tax rate has been cut to 21% from 35%. Moreover, companies will be able to repatriate foreign earnings back into the United States at a lot lower rate.GDP grew 3.2% in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said in its final estimate last week. Moreover, Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 1.5% year over year in November compared with 1.4% in the previous month.Moreover, in its latest December meeting, the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points. This is expected to be a positive for bank stocks. However, the Fed held on to its plans of three rate hikes in 2018 (read: ETF Winners & Losers Post Partly Dovish Fed Meet).The passage of Trump’s tax reform has ignited hopes in the markets relating to deregulation plans. In case there are developments on that line, bank stocks will benefit greatly from the legislation. Trump has been a vocal critic of the Dodd Frank act passed following the 2008 crisis. He has criticized the law as being restrictive to business and aims to scrap it. Optimism related to Trump’s ability to pass his promised legislative policies has increased following his tax reform victory.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the space.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.

2355,WFC,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q4 earnings releases. The going is good so far, with five big banks crushing estimates on both lines and Wells Fargo missing on both.The Zacks Sector Rank for some top banks is in the top 6% while the Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 15%. The uptrend in the benchmark U.S. Treasury yields in recent times thanks to a hawkish Fed, Trump’s tax reform and U.S. economic growth momentum are the other positives for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at banking earnings in detail:Big Bank Earnings in FocusStrong investment banking results and higher rates drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income growth. Further, rise in investment banking fees and stable equity trading income supported the top line. Managed net revenues of $25.5 billion in the quarter were up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25 billion.Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in fourth-quarter 2017 on prudent expense management and strong consumer banking. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.14 per share. Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $17.3 billion in the reported quarter. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.1 billion.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $0.96 but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. The quarter’s total revenues were $22.1 billion, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.4 billion. However, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $21.6 billion.Despite weak fixed income trading revenues, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 15.9%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.68, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.90. Further, the bottom line witnessed 11.8% year-over-year improvement.Though fixed-income trading activities were a drag in the fourth quarter, continued momentum in investment banking business supported the bottom line. Goldman’s net revenues were down 4% year over year to $7.8 billion in the quarter under review. However, the figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 15%.Despite the trading slump, loan growth and impressive investment banking performance drove Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 47 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. Also, the figure was 21% higher than the prior-year quarter. Notably, the results exclude a one-time charge of 27 cents related to the tax act.A fall in fixed income trading revenues (as expected) and mortgage banking losses were outweighed by strong net interest income growth (driven by loan growth and higher interest rates), stable equity trading income and higher investment banking fees.

Also, it was up nearly 7% from the prior-year quarter.Higher interest income and improvement in underwriting fees drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents.

Banks were able to surpass earnings estimates along with reporting a decent overall financial performance.While expected weakness in trading, dismal mortgage banking and rise in credit costs hampered significant improvement in earnings, higher interest rates, modest loan growth and solid investment banking lent support. Further, banks were able to manage costs well.But what cheered investors the most was the upbeat 2018 guidance related to interest income and loan growth. Also, though banks recorded significant one-time charge related to the tax act, favorable management comments regarding the same was a tailwind.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Dec 8, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

2357,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks remained optimistic. Rebound in trading activities (after dismal 2017 performance) is perhaps the primary reason for this bullish price performance.Banks like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expect trading revenues to improve in first-quarter 2018. This is likely to be driven by solid revenues in foreign exchange, emerging markets and equities trading. Specifically, Citigroup expects “low-to-mid” single digit year-over-year increase in trading revenues and JPMorgan projects market revenues to rise in mid-to-high single-digit rate from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, progress in rolling back parts of the Dodd Frank Act cheered investors. The Senate is working on a bipartisan banking bill expected to lower stringent banking regulations. This will likely reduce regulatory compliance cost for several banks.On the other hand, mortgage rates continued to rise, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.46% (marking the ninth consecutive weekly increase). The rise seems to be attributable to chances of rate hike later this month and impending trade war following the imposition of tariffs. This steady rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity, thereby hurting banks mortgage banking revenues to some extent.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, business misconducts continued to dominate headlines for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 2, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. William Galvin, the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, announced that his office has started investigating the wealth management arm of Well Fargo to see if the division has been steering rollover money into managed accounts or if its employees have been making investment recommendations to clients that are unsuitable for them according to their needs.This investigation comes almost a week after Wells Fargo, in its 10K filling revealed that it was conducting an internal review to assess whether there had been unjustified referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.Wells Fargo had agreed to do a detailed investigation only after facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require.The bank did find that in some cases customers had been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.However, Wells Fargo has not yet determined the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the bank’s brokerage division, recently said in a statement that the bank has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""Thus, Galvin said that his office was seeking information about the scope of Wells Fargo’s investigation. They have asked the bank to give them information regarding “inappropriate referrals of brokerage customers to managed and advisory accounts, unsuitable recommendations of alternative investments, as well as unsuitable referrals and recommendations in connection with 401(k) rollovers.”Galvin said, “Given the recent retirement savings crisis in America, referrals and recommendations involving 401(k) accounts should be closely scrutinized, in light of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule.”2.

2358,WFC,"The employees at the brokerage division of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) are being investigated for any possible customer abuses made by them. Recently, William Galvin, the top securities regulator of Massachusetts announced that his office has started investigating the wealth management arm of Well Fargo to see if the division has been steering rollover money into managed accounts or if its employees have been making investment recommendations that are unsuitable for its clients’ needs.This investigation comes almost a week after Wells Fargo, in its 10K filing, revealed that it was conducting an internal review to assess whether there had been unjustified referrals or recommendations, with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.Wells Fargo had agreed to do a detailed investigation, only after facing probes from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require.The bank did find that in some cases customers were overcharged in connection with certain assets and accounts.

To settle the case, the bank had agreed to pay $190 million to the federal and state regulators.Galvin said in a statement, ""Wells Fargo's recent banking scandal, which involved opening bogus accounts for their customers, leads me to believe that where there is smoke, there's fire. I need to be assured that Massachusetts residents haven't been burned by corporate greed.""We believe that while these legal expenses are likely to hurt Wells Fargo’s bottom-line growth, its consistent growth in loans and deposits, lower tax rate and expansions will likely support its growth profile.Shares of the company gained 12% in the past six months, underperforming 20.6% growth of its industry.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc.

2359,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) have lost more than 2% over the last three months amid industry-wide volatility and legal issues, underperforming the industry’s rally of 4.3%.While this San Francisco, CA-based banking giant recorded growing deposits and loan balances over the past few years, displayed a strong capital position and remained focused on undertaking strategic acquisitions, the ongoing litigation issues have primarily challenged its profitability.Troubles have been mounting for Wells Fargo, following the revelation of opening of millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. ‘Cross-selling’, which has been the company’s key strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of employees of the bank had unlawfully enrolled consumers in products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting sales targets. Though the bank is taking necessary steps to address the issue, it undoubtedly keeps the company’s financials under pressure.In addition to the above, persistent rise in operating expenses over the last few quarters  is another concern for Wells Fargo. The company remains focused on expense management with the target of eliminating $4 billion of expenses by 2019. Nevertheless, we believe its bottom line will continue to be affected in the near term on legal expenses related to the above-mentioned sales scam and other litigation issues.Additionally, Wells Fargo’s high debt burden remains another headwind. The company has debt-to-equity ratio of 1.23 compared with the industry average of 0.91. It underlines the financial instability of the company in a turbulent economic environment.Further, Wells Fargo’s quarterly dividend payment might not be sustainable as its earnings have been volatile for the last several quarters. Also, given the bank’s high debt level and above-industry dividend payout ratio, continuation of dividend payout is doubtful which is disadvantageous for value investors.Moreover, Wells Fargo has been witnessing downward earnings estimate revisions for the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down slightly to $4.72 for 2018. For 2019, it edged down around 1% to $5.26 during the same timeframe.With Wells Fargo currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Value Score of C, we don’t see it as an attractive investment option.

2360,WFC,"President Donald Trump’s biggest tax overhaul in decades has raised the appeal of buyback ETFs. This is especially true as a massive $1.4-trillion tax cut and the repatriation policy have prompted companies from almost every sector to boost their multi-billion dollar share buyback program this year.Notably, approximately $2.6 trillion in American corporate profits are sitting in overseas bank accounts, about half of that being in cash. The new tax law encourages these companies to bring this cash back home at much reduced rates (read: How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback and Dividend ETFs?).U.S. companies have announced $209 billion worth of share buyback since the beginning of this year, according to the latest report from Senate Democrats. A California-based research firm TrimTabs stated that the pace of buybacks had exploded in February to a record $153.7 billion from $59.9 billion in January. Among the largest share repurchases so far, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) has been on the forefront, with its additional $25 billion buyback plan. This was followed by $22.6 billion for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), $15 billion for Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), $10 billion for Abbvie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and $10 billion for Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).Given this optimism, 2018 is expected to be the second-busiest year for buybacks since the bull market began in 2009 as U.S. companies are on track to return a record $1 trillion to their shareholders. An analyst at J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expects companies on the S&P 500 index to buy back as much as $800 billion in shares of their own stock this year, representing a whopping jump of 51% (i.e. $300 billion) from $530 billion repurchased last year.About $100 billion of additional buybacks is the result of the tax savings and stronger earnings while $200 billion will be generated from the repatriation bonanza. Another analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) projects that buybacks will rise 23% this year to $650 billion (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).As a result, investors should take advantage of the ongoing boom in share buybacks through the following three ETFs:SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on the 101 top companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratio in the last 12 months. It follows the S&P 500 Buyback Index, charging investors 35 bps in annual fees. From a sector look, financials and consumer discretionary take the largest share with 28.8% and 23.9% allocation, respectively, while information technology and healthcare round off the next spots. The product has a lower AUM of $15.7 million and trades in a paltry volume of around 3,000 shares a day on average (read: Buyback ETF Hits New 52-Week High). PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report)    This ETF tracks the NASDAQ US Buyback Achievers Index, which comprises companies that have repurchased 5% or more of their common stock in the trailing 12 months. It holds 131 stocks in its basket and charges a higher annual fee of 63 bps. Here also, financials and consumer discretionary are the top two sectors, with at least 29% share each, closely followed by consumer staples (15.3%). PKW is the popular fund in the buyback space, managing an asset base of nearly $1.4 billion and trading in an average daily volume of 67,000 shares.AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS  -  Free Report)This is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks with liquidity and fundamental characteristics that are historically associated with superior long-term performance. This approach results in a basket of 101 securities with financials and consumer discretionary as the top two sectors accounting for 19% of assets each. This was followed by industrials (18%), information technology (13%) and healthcare (13%). The product has amassed $113.7 million in its asset base while sees low volume of nearly 6,000 shares a day. The fund charges 90 bps in annual fees.iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (DIVB  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to a broad basket of 379 U.S. companies that return capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back their stock.

Moreover, results improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03.Notably, results are preliminary which might be impacted on resolution of matters with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s compliance risk-management program with a charge of $1 billion in civil money penalties.Lower provisions and higher interest income aided results. However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income, with lower mortgage revenues, were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans and deposits acted as headwinds for the quarter.The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.7 billion. However, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $22.3 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking segment’s total quarterly revenues increased slightly, while Wholesale Banking revenues were down around 3.9%, and revenues for the Wealth and Investment Management unit edged down moderately.Loans, Non-Interest & Interest Income Fall, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.2 billion, down 1% year over year. Increased interest income from debt securities, loans held for sale, loans, equity securities, along with higher other interest income, were mostly offset by higher interest expense. Further, net interest margin contracted 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.84%.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 2% year over year, primarily due to fall in almost all components of income, partly offset by net gains from equity securities and higher other income.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans were $947.3 billion, down around 1.2% year over year. Reduction in consumer as well as commercial loan portfolio was recorded. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, down 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $14.2 billion, up 3% from the year-earlier quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from a rise in salaries and commission, and incentive compensation, along with elevated other expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reduction of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 64.9% came in above the 62% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the reported quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $11.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, down 8.1% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $191 million, plummeting 68.4% year over year. Net charge-offs were $741 million or 0.32% of average loans in the first quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter’s net charge-offs of $805 million (0.34%). Non-performing assets were down 22.4% to $8.3 billion in the quarter under review from $10.7 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the recently-reported quarter, the company returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $153.1 billion from $148.5 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 12% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.2% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $37.33 from $35.67 recorded in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointTop-line headwinds, aided by lower net interest income and fee income, were perceived. Furthermore, flaring up expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business. Nevertheless, improved credit quality reflecting lower provisions were positives.Despite several legal tensions, Wells Fargo remains focused on maintaining its financial position. Last year, the banking giant doubled its cost-cutting targets to combat escalating expenses. These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders.We believe, over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also anticipate strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help it expand its business and enhance profitability. Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company Quote Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The rise was driven by trust and investment services, capital markets and card fees, partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses were up 5.7% year over year to $898 million.

2365,WFC,"A huge Christmas gift has arrived early for corporate America as the much-awaited tax reform bill has been passed. The bill cuts corporate tax to 21% from 35%, allowing a one-time tax break to companies that have stashed cash overseas.This is likely lead to huge savings and cash repatriation for the companies. The bill is likely to benefit a few sectors along with some stocks. If we talk about banks and technology stocks, the former stand to benefit more than the latter.While tech companies that have significant amounts of cash stashed overseas will gain from one-time repatriation, they are less likely to benefit from tax rate cut as compared to the banks.Wondering how banks are anticipated to gain more? Apart from bringing back overseas cash, banks will benefit considerably from lower tax rates. Per a Wells Fargo analyst, finance companies pay the highest effective tax among the major S&P sectors.Therefore, several large banks including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) are likely to record a double-digit increase in earnings in the coming years driven by lower tax rate. Further, it will be easier for global banks to compete with lower taxed foreign banks.Additionally, smaller domestic banks will also gain. They are expected to use increased earnings by upgrading technology and may even pass on the benefits to their employees in form of pay rise and one-time bonus. Well, many banks including Washington Federal, Inc. (WAFD  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) have already announced such initiatives.Also, as overseas cash is brought back, it is expected to provide an impetus to M&As activities, thereby boosting investment banking. Also, as the bill will lower tax rates on wealthy individuals, asset management units of banks are expected to see a rise in money available for investment.Moreover, as the tax bill spurs economic improvement leading to a rise in lending activities and higher interest rates, banks will benefit indirectly as well. So, this is a win-win situation for the banks.Of the above-mentioned banks, Washington Federal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BofA and Fifth Third have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2366,WFC,"To date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite have experienced substantial gains, while the S&P 500 has surged over 20% in 2017.Now, after the passage of the new GOP tax plan, which is set to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, companies from many industries should be set to see their bottom lines expand next year. On top of that, firms should theoretically be able to invest a larger amount of money back into their businesses.The real outcome of the Republican tax overhaul will not be measurable for some time, but companies from Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) to AT&T (T  -  Free Report) have already promised to share the wealth with employees.Furthermore, the new tax plan should also help lift investor confidence as we head into 2018, and it could set up the Amazons (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Apples AAPL of the world to possibly experience even bigger gains in the New Year.However, even without the GOP tax bill, a few firms more than doubled the gains of these tech giants in 2017. Better yet, there are a few of these bigger movers that are currently Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks.With that said, let’s take a look at three stocks, which also have high Zacks Ranks, that all soared over 200% in 2017:1.      SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (SEDG  -  Free Report)Shares of this renewable energy firm, which aims to help maximize solar output through an array of solutions, have skyrocketed 208% in 2017. SolarEdge is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM score. On top of that, SolarEdge is currently trading at a respectable 17.36x earnings.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to surge 96% year-over-year to hit $0.63 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. SolarEdge’s Q4 sales are expected to climb 61.23%. These projections could help the company’s stock continue to pop as we head into 2018. Lastly, looking even farther ahead, SolarEdge’s EPS is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 24% over the next three to five years.2.       Control4 Corporation (CTRL  -  Free Report)Control4 Corporation is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also rocks an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company offers clients the opportunity to integrate video, lighting, temperature, security, communications and more into one connected home solution. The stock has skyrocketed 211% since the start of the year.Aside from these massive gains, investors might be happy to learn that shares of Control4 currently rest over 11% below their 52-week high—which could provide the chance to buy on the dip ahead of what is expected to be solid Q4 and full-year top and bottom line expansion.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Control4’s full-year earnings to surge by 34% to hit $1.14 per share. On top of that, the connected home firm’s full-year sales are projected to hit $244 million, which would mark a nearly 17% year-over-year increase.3.       Textainer Group Holdings Limited (TGH  -  Free Report)Shares of this shipping container company have skyrocketed 204% in 2017. Textainer is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has received three upward full-year earnings estimate revisions against no downgrades—all of which came in the last 60 days.Looking ahead to Textainer’s fourth-quarter, the company is expected to post earnings of $0.18 per share, which would mark an 176.39% climb after the company reported a loss in the year-ago period. One the world’s largest lessors of shipping containers is also projected to see its Q4 sales gain 7.63%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2367,WFC,"Troubles for Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) seems to have no end. This time they come from a teacher’s union — The American Federation of Teachers (“AFT”) — demanding the bank to restrain itself from providing finance to gun dealers and the National Rifle Association (“NRA”).After the recent tragic incident at a high school that took lives of innocent students and educators, AFT’s President Randi Weingarten raised concerns over Wells Fargo’s connections with the gunmakers and NRA.In a release issued on Apr 7, the union disclosed plans to discontinue the Wells Fargo mortgage program offering to members, if the bank fails to take an appropriate action. The union said, “We’re issuing Wells Fargo an ultimatum—they can have a mortgage market that includes America’s teachers, or they can continue to do business with the NRA and gun manufacturers. They can’t do both.”Exchange Between AFT and Wells Fargo So FarOn Mar 29, Weingarten had sent a letter to the San Francisco-based lender reflecting disappointment over the bank being one of the largest backer to gun companies. Also, she questioned the bank if it provided NRA with a line of credit of $28 million and helped two of the largest gun companies in United States access $431.1 million in loans and bonds.In response, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer, Tim Sloan, said that the correct way to address these issues would be through political and legislative procedure. Also, he reiterated the bank’s efforts in assisting about 1600 AFT families with home financing in 2017.Further, Sloan extended an invitation to Weingarten for further discussion and added, ""I do not believe that the American public wants banks to decide which legal products consumers can and cannot buy.""Finally, Weingarten reminded Wells Fargo of the steps taken by Dick's Sporting Goods, REI, LL Bean and Kroger against sales of guns. Also, she raised strong oppositions to gun violence and people involved with it by saying, “But no conversation will dissuade us from our view that the NRA and the gun manufacturers need to value people over profits.”Reactions From Other BanksIn March 2018, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) announced changes in the manner the bank would conduct business with gun retailers. In an email statement, it said that new policy retailers must sell firearms only to customers above 21 years of age and they must have passed a background check. Also, these retailers should not sell ""bump stocks"" or high-capacity magazines.Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) are among the banks that have spoken against the gun culture, but so far haven't come out with similar plans.Our ViewpointThe fake accounts fallout had marked the beginning of the bank’s troubles. Despite efforts to maintain financial health, Wells Fargo’s expense base is likely to continue affect its financials for some time, primarily due to high legal costs. Further, this news is likely to negatively impact the sentiments of the bank’s customers and might slightly hurt its revenues.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 4.8% over the past six months against the industry’s rally of 4.4%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

The reported figure increased 22% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings growth was supported by an increase in net interest income. The private education loan portfolio and deposits grew considerably. However, these positives were offset by lower non-interest income, elevated expenses and poor credit quality.After considering the charges related to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, core earnings attributable to its common stock for the quarter came in at $44 million.For 2017, Sallie Mae reported core earnings of $278 million or 63 cents per share, up from $231 million or 53 cents per share registered in the prior year.Rise in Net Interest Income Offsets Higher Expenses & Lower Other IncomeNet interest income for the fourth quarter was $309.2 million, up 26% year over year.

Net interest margin expanded 45 basis points (bps) year over year to 6%.The company reported non-interest loss of $22 million against income of $9.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The loss was attributable to a lower valuation of tax indemnification receivables in relation to the tax reform.The company’s total expenses increased 20.8% year over year to $118.7 million. The rise was mainly due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, higher FDIC assessment fees and other expenses.Efficiency ratio, on a non-GAAP basis, increased to 41.2% in the quarter from 37.9% in the year-ago period. A higher ratio indicates a decline in profitability.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for loan losses was $55.3 million, up 28% year over year.Delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in repayment were 2.4%, reflecting an increase of 3 bps in the year-ago quarter.Growth in Deposit and LoansAs of Dec 31, 2017, deposits of Sallie Mae Bank were $15.5 billion, up from $13.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.

Capital ratios exceeded the “well capitalized” industry benchmark in regulatory requirements.2018 OutlookThe company estimates core earnings per share in the range of 97 cents to $1.01 for this year.

Private education loan originations are projected to be $5 billion.Also, the company plans to make investments of about $30 million in 2018, with a view to diversify its consumer lending platform into the personal loan and credit card businesses and also be technologically advanced.Our ViewpointResults of Sallie Mae highlight consistent focus on increasing private education loan assets, maintaining a solid capital position by introducing multiple complementary new products and improving efficiency.We believe improving economic conditions and lower tax rate will assist Sallie Mae in maintaining its leading position in the student lending market.

2369,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, volatility in the stock market affected the banking stocks as well. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s congressional testimony dominated, wherein he presented an optimistic picture of the U.S. economy. This view hints at a rise in inflation, which will give the Fed all the more reason to take a hawkish stance in raising interest rates.Additionally, growth in economy, low unemployment rate and strong consumer sentiment will drive the demand for loans and other related products of banks. These will support banks’ financials though the markets seem to be wary of such a scenario. Hence, this led to significant volatility and bank stocks’ performance turned bearish over the last five trading sessions.Driven by the Fed’s upbeat view on the economy, mortgage rates were also on an upswing with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.43% (highest in more than four years). However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, business misconducts continued to dominate headlines. On the other hand, banks seem to be optimistic about gains from improving economy.Further, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $42.2 billion, down 2.3% year over year. Results were adversely impacted by elevated income taxes, higher non-interest expenses and loan loss provisions.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 23, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) plans to refund about $330 million to its credit card customers by the latter half of this year, after having confessed to charging higher interest rates to some of the defaulters, since 2011.

The suit accuses the bank of targeting African-American and Latino communities in Sacramento for issuing loans with more expensive and higher risk compared to loans made to white borrowers. (Read more: Wells Fargo Sued Over Unfair Discrimination Practices)3. In yet other setback for Wells Fargo, it disclosed to have overcharged customers in investment and fiduciary services business. In the annual filing, the bank said the review process of its Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages.”After facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require, Wells Fargo agreed to do a detailed investigation of the segment.In its latest 10-K filing, the bank revealed that it is currently assessing whether there has been unjustified referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.So far in the review process, the bank has found that in some cases customers have been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.Wells Fargo is yet to determine the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.4. At annual Investors’ Day conference, JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) management discussed the current macroeconomic backdrop and the path the company is taking to enhance profitability over the medium term.

2370,WFC,"Recently, Wells Fargo and Company (WFC  -  Free Report) in its annual filing, disclosed to have overcharged customers in its investment and fiduciary services business. Also, it said the review process of the bank’s Wealth and Investment Management segment is in “preliminary stages”.After facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require, Wells Fargo agreed to do a detailed investigation of the segment.In its latest 10K filing, the bank revealed that it is currently assessing whether there has been unjustified referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.So far in the review process, the bank has found that in some cases customers have been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.Wells Fargo is yet to determine the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.Recently, Wells Fargo faced another lawsuit filed by the city of Sacramento, for conducting discriminatory lending practices. It accusedthe bank of targeting African-American and Latino communities in Sacramento for issuing loans with more expensive and higher risk compared to loans made to white borrowers. Also, per the complaint, Wells Fargo has been accused of practicing discrimination against minority borrowers for more than a decade with the aim of recording higher earnings.Currently, the bank has a lot to deal with on the litigation front. Further, growing intolerance of the regulators with regard to the violations Wells Fargo’s has made over the past years can act as a key negative for the bank.

2371,WFC,"Jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break. This in turn will encourage corporations to invest more in the United States, resulting in a rise in wages, jobs and a stronger economy.While miners, energy, retailers, tech, banks and pharma are expected to enjoy the biggest gains from the tax package, health insurers and hospitals are poised to lose. Needless to say, moneyed Americans like Trump will also make the most of the tax overhaul.House Gives Final Approval to Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, sending a $1.5-trillion tax bill to the President for signature. The House was compelled to vote again, after it was discovered that the bill they had earlier passed violated some of the necessary rules for Senate Republicans to pass it with simple majority. The House, nevertheless, passed the tax reform bill by 224-201 majority, while the Republican-led Senate had earlier passed it by a vote of 51 to 48.Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019.Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation.Winners & Losers From the Republican Tax BillAmong the largest beneficiaries of the tax bill include mining, accommodation and food services that can make use of the allowance for short lived equipment. Levies for repatriating overseas profits will boost major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor, according to UBS. Meanwhile, the reduction in effective rate will be a shot in the arm for energy players as they pay the second-highest tax rate at 37%, per Bloomberg Intelligence.For retailers, the bill will be beneficial on multiple fronts. A tax relief among the wealthy and middle-class will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods, while big consumer product makers such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Pepsico have large cash holdings offshore that can be used for innovation and deal making, noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Shea.One-time low tax rate on foreign profits will also help multinationals including large tech majors to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths like Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Oracle hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Banks also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20% (read more: Wall Street Hits Record Highs on Tax-Cut Optimism: 5 Gainers).American biopharma companies, in the meanwhile, make up one-third of the top 30 U.S. firms with the most cash abroad. A slashed tax rate for repatriated offshore cash, thus, will benefit big drug makers like Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) ($39 billion offshore), Gilead Sciences ($32 billion), Pfizer (about $22 billion) and Merck & Co. (about $20 billion), according to a recent Credit Suisse report.The report further added that lowering of corporate tax rates will b enefit certain drug makers that pay high effective tax rate and have lower foreign income. The main companies among them are Bioverative (36% effective tax rate), United Therapeutics (37%) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (33%).However, the bill is a mixed bag for health care. Repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate won’t help health insurers and hospitals. The provision required every American to have health insurance coverage or less pay a fine. Ending of such a provision will reduce the number of people who buy insurance coverage. And for hospitals, a lesser number of insured people mean fewer paying customers.But, for individual UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), a drop in the effective tax rate will boost profits by as much as 15%, according Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. The health insurer had payed about 32.5% income tax in the third quarter.Wind Up: Big Victory for TrumpThere is no doubt that passing of the bill is a great victory for Trump, both politically and personally. He had pledged to provide such business-friendly policies since his election years.  Such promises have also helped the broader equity markets gain traction and the major bourses hit a series of record highs this year. Further, these measures are likely to help the markets sustain the current bull run heading into 2018.In addition, a legislative win is beneficial for Trump and his family. Remember, the tax bill trims the ultra-rich individual tax bracket from 39.6% to 37%, while the “pass-through” provision will provide a major windfall to wealthy investors like Trump.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

2372,WFC,"Ahead of Thursday’s opening bell this morning, the third and final read on 3rd quarter 2017 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was released. The good news: we keep the 3-handle for back-to-back quarters for the first time in a couple years. The bad news (and it’s not that bad): the 3.2% tally is a tenth less than the previous read of 3.3%.Breaking it down a bit, Consumption brought in 2.2% in Q3, a tenth lower than the previous read, as did “core” GDP quarter over quarter reaching 1.3%. Prices were in-line sequentially at 2.1%. Just some trimming around the edges, and the 3.2% headline clearly illustrates growth in the U.S. economy in the recent past.Looking forward toward Q4 GDP estimates, the median read currently sits at 2.6% — roughly what calendar 2017 would shape up to be overall if this were to be accurate. Yet the massive tax cut bill just passed through Congress may pull growth from future quarters as consumers and corporate CEOs gain confidence in economic growth to put capital to work now, and get the jump on competition.Equipment and spending have already begun to add to GDP, and a gigantic corporate cash windfall from slashed tax rates next year may well add even more. For years, economic growth had been stymied by obstruction and inaction from Congress, so some pent-up business investment may be a natural occurrence already; now with fresh tax reduction reviving corporate interests, it may stand to reason this investment may spike — and take future GDP reads up with it.We even hear reports that some companies, like AT&T (T  -  Free Report) are passing along $1000 bonuses to their employees. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) have pledged to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour following the tax passage. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has announced a commitment of $300 million in worker training. These measures would provide a direct benefit to the domestic workforce, at least in some places, regardless whether or not the tax bill was really created to assist middle-income Americans as advertised or not.There is still the matter of reaching a deal in Congress to avoid a government shutdown to end this already active week on Capitol Hill. There is almost nothing more conceivably dampening of the good spirits felt among GOP congresspeople than the realization the U.S. government is non-operational. This morning, a temporary extension to January 19 is being worked up and votes tallied — this would include measures important to Democrats like Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — that would require 218 total votes in the House, and 8 Democrats joining all GOP senators.

2373,WFC,"Already burdened by mounting legal woes, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), one of the biggest players in the U.S. mortgage business, faces yet another suit over its discriminatory lending practices. This time, the company has been sued by the city of Sacramento.The suit, filed last Friday, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, accuses Wells Fargo of targeting African-American and Latino communities in Sacramento for issuing loans with more expensive and higher risk compared to loans made to white borrowers. The complaint accused Wells Fargo of practicing discrimination against minority borrowers for more than a decade with the aim of recording higher earnings.The lawsuit mentioned that the African-American borrowers with strong credit were able to receive high costs loan more than twice as compared with the white borrowers, while Latino borrowers were 1.4 times as likely as white borrowers. It further claimed that most of such loans led to foreclosures as the company denied refinancing the loans on the similar terms it offered to white borrowers.The city argues that the bank purposely increased foreclosures in minority communities in Sacramento which reduced surrounding property values resulting in economic loss. Further, on the back of the city’s loss of property taxes on abandoned properties and lowered value of foreclosed properties, the city seeks monetary compensation.“Wells Fargo has systematically engaged in a continuous and unbroken discriminatory pattern and practice of steering minority borrowers in Sacramento into higher cost or more onerous mortgage loans with discriminatory terms when more favorable and less expensive loans were being offered to similarly situated non-minority borrowers,” the lawsuit states.In the lawsuit, the city of Sacramento investigated Wells Fargo’s lending practices and concluded that the bank was involved in redlining and reverse-redlining. Under such discriminatory practices, it used racial criteria to direct potential borrowers toward certain neighborhoods and determined their eligibility for loans, while reverse is the practice of indulging those communities in risky and high-cost loans. Therefore, the lawsuit alleged Wells Fargo of practicing reverse-redlining in Sacramento since the late 1990s and increasing it in the following years.“Wells Fargo’s discriminatory lending practices knowingly place vulnerable, underserved borrowers in loans they cannot afford,” the lawsuit states. “The practices maximize Wells Fargo’s profits without regard to the borrower’s best interests, the borrower’s ability to repay, or the financial health of underserved minority neighborhoods.”It was noted that the U.S. Department of Justice and some of the other cities, such as Los Angeles, Oakland, Miami, Baltimore, Memphis and Miami Gardens, filed similar lawsuits against the banking giant.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo’s spokesperson was unavailable for comments.Among other mortgage lenders — Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) — were also sued for discrimination in lending practices. Deutsche Bank AG had also been previously accused by Los Angeles of letting the foreclosed homes in low-income regions deteriorate to poor conditions. The case was settled in June 2013.For banks, legal headwinds are on an upswing. These firms continue to face several cases and probes regarding their business conduct preceding the financial crisis. Though the banks resolved many litigation issues over the past years, increasing legal hassles keep dragging the financials downward.Wells Fargo’s performance over the past year reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of this Wall Street biggie have gained 3.6%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 19.2%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2374,WFC,"Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) surged nearly 2% to inch closer to their all-time high on Monday following an array of news regarding the iPhone giant, including a significant iCloud announcement and further investment from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report).iCloud UpdateApple’s iCloud service has become widely popular with customers, especially on iPhone and iPad devices. The company’s storage service allows Apple users to store a massive amount of data—often photos and videos—in the cloud to prevent their devices from filling up.The platform is widely used, but some investors might not know that the company uses other cloud computing technology to house Apple user data. Apple noted in a recent iOS Security update that it now uses Alphabet (GOOGL) cloud services.“The keys and the file’s metadata are stored by Apple in the user’s iCloud account,” Apple noted in the report. “The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as S3 and Google Cloud Platform.”Media outlets had previously reported—as early as 2016—that Apple uses Google’s cloud services for iCloud storage, but Apple did not confirm this until recently.Apple has worked heavily with Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure cloud services, as well as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS, in the past. Microsoft was notably left out of the language in the most recent report, while Amazon’s S3 cloud-based data storage service is still mentioned.China According to a new Reuters report, Apple will begin to store its iCloud data for Chinese customers in China. Until now, the company stored its Chinese data in the U.S. This move has raised some security concerns, as many experts worry that the Chinese government will be able to access user data too easily.A new set of Chinese laws require cloud services offered to Chinese citizens be operated by Chinese companies, with the data stored in China.The Chinese government previously had to go through the U.S. legal system in order to obtain any information it might want. Now it will not. “While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful,” Apple said in a statement.Apple users outside of China won’t have their iCould storage changed in any way.Warren BuffettWarren Buffett seems more bullish on Apple than ever before. The Oracle of Omaha noted in a recent interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that his company has purchased more Apple stock than anything else over the last year.Buffett placed much of his faith in Apple on the company’s ability to keep customers.""Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,"" Buffett told CNBC. ""I see how strong that ecosystem is, to an extraordinary degree. … You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using. [IPhone] is a very sticky product.""Berkshire Hathaway’s other large positions include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and other industry powers.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2375,WFC,"Despite the trading slump,loan growth and impressive investment banking performancedrove Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 47 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. Also, the figure was 21% higher than the prior-year quarter. Notably, the results exclude a one-time charge of 27 cents related to the tax act.Impressive net interest income growth (driven by loan growth and higher interest rates), stable equity trading income and higher investment banking fees supported revenues. Operating expenses also recorded a decline.However, a fall in fixed income trading revenues (as expected) and mortgage banking losses were the undermining factors. Also, drastic rise in provision for credit losses acted as a headwind.Overall performance of the company’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments witnessed improvement in net income except Global Markets and All Others.Loans & Higher Rates Support Revenues, Expenses DownAdjusted net revenues amounted to $21.4 billion, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.3 billion. Also, it was up nearly 7% from the prior-year quarter. The figure in the reported quarter excluded $0.9 billion of one-time charge related to the tax act.Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, grew 11% year over year to $11.7 billion. Further, net interest yield rose 16 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.39%.Non-interest income declined 7% from the year-ago quarter to $9 billion. The fallwas mainly dueto lower mortgage banking income and the impact of the tax act.Non-interest expenses were $13.3 billion, down 1% year over year. The fall reflects reduced personnel and non-personnel expenses.Provisions JumpProvision for credit losses increased 29% year over year to $1 billion, mainly due to a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Also, net charge-offs jumped 41% from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion.However, as of Dec 31, 2017, ratio of nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties was 0.73%, down 16 bps year over year.Strong Capital PositionThe company’s book value per share as of Dec 31, 2017 was $23.80 compared with $23.97 as of Dec 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share as of Dec 31, 2017 was $16.96, up from $16.89 as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio (Basel 3 Fully Phased-in) (Advanced approaches) was 11.8%, up from 11.0% as of Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeBofA’s efforts to realign its balance sheet and focus on core operations will likely support bottom-line growth. Further, the bank is well positioned to benefit from higher interest rates.As expected, fixed income trading declined.

Results included $3.35 billion after-tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, $848 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services and $3.25 billion pre-tax expenses related to litigation accruals.Though fixed income trading income slumped as expected, Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share were driven by prudent expense management and strong consumer banking.

2376,WFC,"Despite weak fixed income trading revenues, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 15.9%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.68, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.90. Further, the bottom line witnessed 11.8% year-over-year improvement.Notably, results, including income tax expense related to the tax reform of $4.4 billion, reported net loss of $1.93 billion or $5.51 per share.Though the investment bank remains under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the fourth quarter, a continued momentum in investment banking business supported the bottom-line numbers. Further, higher underwriting revenues was recorded.Elevated expenses were an undermining factor. Notably, the quarter witnessed challenging market-making environment, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.For full-year 2017, adjusted net income per share of $19.76 came in higher than the year-ago earnings of $16.29. Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.98.Revenues Fall Y/Y, Expenses EscalateFor full-year 2017, the company’s reported revenues of $32.1 billion were up 5% year over year. Moreover, revenues managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31.8 billion.Goldman’s net revenues were down 4% year over year to $7.8 billion in the quarter under review. However, the figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion.Quarterly revenues, as per business segments, are as follows:The Institutional Client Services division recorded revenues of $2.4 billion, down 34% year over year. The fall indicates lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution revenues (down 50% year over year), adversely affected by lower revenues from interest rate products, commodities, mortgage products, currencies and credit products.Fall in equities client execution, partially offset by rise in securities service revenues, resulted in the downside in Equities revenues (down 14%).The Investment Banking division generated revenues of $2.1 billion, up 44% year over year. Results highlight higher underwriting revenues (up 76%), aided by elevated debt and equity underwriting revenues. In addition, higher financial advisory revenues (up 9%) were recorded.The Investment Management division recorded revenues of $1.7 billion, up 4% year over year. The growth was mainly driven by higher management and other fees, along with transaction fees, partially offset by lower incentive fees.The Investing and Lending division’s revenues of $1.7 billion in the quarter were 12% higher on a year-over-year basis. The upside stemmed from the surge in revenues from investments in equities.Total operating expenses flared up 1% year over year to $4.7 billion. Expenses moved up mainly due to rise in non-compensation expenses (up 10%), partly offset by decline in compensation and employee-benefit expenses (down 12%).Expenses included rise in almost all components, partially offset by lower other costs.Strong Capital PositionGoldman displayed a robust capital position in the reported quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.9% under the Basel III Advanced Approach, highlighting the valid transitional provisions. The figure was down from 13.1% recorded in the prior-year quarter. Notably, the ratio was impacted by 70 basis points (bps) due to the tax legislation.The company’s supplementary leverage ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, was 5.8% at the end of the reported quarter, down from 6.4% recorded in the previous quarter. Notably, the ratio was impacted by 30 bps due to the tax legislation.Adjusted return on average common shareholders’ equity, on an annualized basis, was 10.8% as of Dec 31, 2017.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring 2017, Goldman repurchased 29 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $231.87 and a total cost of $6.72 billion. Notably, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company repurchased 6.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $241.13 and a total cost of $1.59 billion.ConclusionResults of Goldman highlight an impressive quarter. Though trading activities and tax expense related to the recent tax reform weighed on the results, robust investment banking results and underwriting business were positive factors.The company’s well-diversified business, apart from its solid investment banking operations, continues to ensure earnings stability. Its focus to capitalize on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, will likely bolster overall business growth. However, costs stemming from brokerage and market development remain near- to medium-term headwinds. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

For years, economic growth had been stymied by obstruction and inaction from Congress, so some pent-up business investment may be a natural occurrence already; now with fresh tax reduction reviving corporate interests, it may stand to reason this investment may spike — and take future GDP reads up with it.We even hear reports that some companies, like AT&T (T  -  Free Report) are passing along $1000 bonuses to their employees. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) have pledged to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour following the tax passage. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has announced a commitment of $300 million in worker training. These measures would provide a direct benefit to the domestic workforce, at least in some places, regardless whether or not the tax bill was really created to assist middle-income Americans as advertised or not.There is still the matter of reaching a deal in Congress to avoid a government shutdown to end this already active week on Capitol Hill. There is almost nothing more conceivably dampening of the good spirits felt among GOP congresspeople than the realization the U.S. government is non-operational. This morning, a temporary extension to January 19 is being worked up and votes tallied — this would include measures important to Democrats like Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — that would require 218 total votes in the House, and 8 Democrats joining all GOP senators.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2378,WFC,"Congress’s nonpartisan scorekeeper in tax matters, the Joint Committee on Taxation, declared that the House Republicans passed an overhaul of the U.S. tax code that slashes corporate tax rates on Thursday.Big banks will benefit immensely from the tax cut as this will likely bolster investments. Lower tax rates also drive after-tax earnings for tech behemoths as it leads to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and development, as well as mergers and acquisitions.Small-cap companies are poised to gain enormously as well, mostly because they have been paying more taxes than their counterparts. Thus, investors should focus on multinational financial and technology service providers, as well as small-cap players, that can make the most of the slashed corporate tax rate.Senate Passes Tax Bill House Republicans approved a monumental bill to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The bill cleared the House 227-205, without Democratic support. The Democrats believed that it is a give-away to the wealthiest Americans. 13 Republicans representing districts with an already high average state and local tax deduction also voted against the bill.Such a high tax deduction will be scaled back significantly under the House plan. Nevertheless, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that around 92% of Americans will pay less or the same taxes until 2023 under the new plan.Republicans, in the meantime, have been rooting for a change in tax codes for several years but have repeatedly failed to garner support in the House until Trump’s election. Trump said that such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families, while the White House press secretary said that “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”This has set the stage for Republicans to execute their ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses more competitive globally.Great for Banks & Tech CompaniesThe bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, making it the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates ever.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut  to 20%.Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Small Caps Rally on House VoteAfter the House passed the tax bill, small-cap stocks surged. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Moreover, Trump’s call for more protectionism and less global trade boosted small caps that mostly generate less than 20% of its revenues from overseas. In contrast, large-cap companies typically generate more than 30% of their sales from abroad.The Russell 2000 Index, which comprises the smallest companies in terms of market capitalization, is up more than 27% since Trump was elected, while the S&P Small Cap 600 Index climbed more than 25% since the close of trading on Nov 8.Top 5 WinnersInvestors should double down on the hottest banking and tech bigwigs, as well as solid companies with smaller market capitalizations.

2379,WFC,"The unprecedented reversal in the stock market on Jan 16 signals at more choppy trading sessions ahead, thanks to fears of a possible federal government shutdown by the end of the week. The Republican-led Congress is facing numerous obstacles from fellow conservatives and many Democrats.Traders also looked at the recent record-breaking run by major bourses as another sign that the market is getting too pricey and entering the overbought territory. Given such uncertainties, investing in sound stocks that are unfazed by market gyrations seems judicious.Threat of a Government Shutdown LoomsU.S. stocks scaled to record highs last week, mostly on positive earnings results from banking majors Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). They beat analysts’ estimates for revenues and earnings. However, this week, the broader market failed to sustain the gains as investors apprehend a government shutdown.Republican-led Congress needs to pass a funding bill by Jan 19 to avert a government closure. But there are perils. Conservatives within the party want a hike in defense spending that such a bill will not provide. Meanwhile, Democrats might withhold their support until issues related to immigration policy are sorted out. Talks regarding shielding the Dreamers — immigrants brought into the country illegally as children — from deportation have come to a sudden halt between the parties.President Trump, in the meanwhile, has expressed his displeasure toward the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era immigration policy. He has repeatedly blamed the Democrats for such an executive order. The President argued that such a policy isn’t adequate and demanded a merit-based system of immigration as well as funding for a border wall with neighboring state Mexico.But, if we look into last week, negotiations regarding an immigration policy managed to reach a conclusion with the President promising to sign whatever the congressional negotiators decide on. This was taken as a sign of progress in an already tense situation. Having said that, here, we are again facing the possibility of a government shutdown. This makes us believe that shutdown threats are common to politicians. This is because it helps the governing party and the opposition to win over their supporters. After all, the governing party shows that their opposition doesn’t want them to work smoothly and meet their core targets. The opposition also adopts this as a primary stand on an issue that is of utmost importance to them. Needless to say, party affiliations may change, but political dynamics more or less remain the same.How to Play a Possible Government Shutdown?To avoid an embarrasing shutdown, the Republicans rolled out a plan to fund the government for a short time. But, such a move is only expected to extend the deadline for a shutdown until Feb 16. So, the concern remains, with the markets apprehending a lot of gyration in the near future. Thus, such uncertainty calls for investors to build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of ultra-safe stocks.They essentially have a low beta, which makes them less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. They also have large market capitalization (a market capitalization value of $10 billion or more), which helps them provide steadily-increasing earnings growth without having much risk of collapsing. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), through its subsidiary Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates railroads in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.9. Union Pacific’s expected growth for the current year is 14.2%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 9.9%.EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), together with its subsidiaries, explores for, develops, produces, and markets crude oil and natural gas. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 and a beta of 0.98. EOG Resources’ expected growth for the current year is more than 100%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 28.6%.NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) operates as a homebuilder in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.75. NVR’s expected growth for the current year is 42.5%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 16.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) provides various products to connect and share through mobile devices, personal computers, and other surfaces worldwide. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.68. Facebook’s expected growth for the current year is 37.6%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 10.8%.Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report), through its subsidiaries, owns and operates full-service restaurants in the United States and Canada. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 and a beta of 0.2. Darden Restaurants’ expected growth for the current year is 16.4%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 1.1%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2380,WFC,"Though fixed income trading income slumped as expected, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in fourth-quarter 2017 on prudent expense management and strong consumer banking. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.14 per share.Notably, results including non-recurring non-cash charge related to the tax reform of $22 billion, or $8.43 per share, reported loss of $18.3 billion or $7.15 per share.Adjusted net income came in at $3.7 billion, up 4% year over year.Overall top-line strength was reflected, driven by higher banking and consumer banking revenues, along with loan growth. Moreover, expenses dropped on efficiency savings by the bank.However, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the fourth quarter were up 16% year over year to $2.1 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.9 billion and a net loan loss reserve build of $165 million.For full-year 2017, adjusted net income came in at $15.8 billion compared with $14.9 billion recorded in 2016.Top-Line Strength & Low Expenses RecordedFor full-year 2017, the company reported revenues of $71.4 billion, up 2% year over year. Furthermore, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $71.2 billion.Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $17.3 billion in the reported quarter. The rise highlights elevated revenues in the global consumer banking, mostly offset by decline in institutional clients group and corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.1 billion.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $8.1 billion in the quarter, down 1% year over year. Though securities services revenues increased 14%, lower equity markets (down 23%) and fixed income revenues (down 18%) offset the rise on a year-over-year basis. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 11%.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 6% year over year to $8.4 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $746 million, decreasing 13% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly underlined legacy assets runoff.Operating expenses at Citigroup were down slightly year over year to $10.1 billion. Efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets mitigated increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.84 trillion, up 3% year over year. The company’s loans grew 7% year over year to $667 billion. Deposits increased 3% year over year to $960 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 17% year over year to $4.8 billion. The company reported a drop of 15% in consumer non-accrual loans to $2.7 billion. In addition, corporate non-accrual loans of $1.9 billion went down 20% from the year-earlier period.Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $12.4 billion at quarter end, or 1.87% of total loans, compared with $12.1 billion, or 1.94%, recorded in the year-ago period.Solid Capital PositionAt the end of the reported quarter, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.3%, decreasing from 12.6% in the year-ago quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.7%, down from 7.2% in the year-earlier quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, book value per share was $70.85, down 5% year over year and tangible book value per share was $60.40, down 6% from the prior-year period. Results include mainly the estimated impact of the Tax Reform.Capital DeploymentDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Citigroup repurchased about 74 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $6.3 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also, though the bank was impacted by non-recurring non-cash charges related to the tax reform. Furthermore, restructuring efforts, including streamlining moves, will likely continue to ease the bank’s burden on the expense base. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Also, rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Citigroup Inc. QuoteCurrently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Competitive LandscapeWells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of 96 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.04.Including $3.35 billion after-tax benefit, or 67 cents, from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, $848 million pre-tax gain, or 11 cents from the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services and $3.25 billion pre-tax expense, or 59 cents related to litigation accruals, net income came in at $6.2 billion or $1.16 per share.Amid an expected trading weakness, strong investment banking results and higher rates drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. Results exclude one-time tax related charge of $2.4 billion or 69 cents per share.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income growth. Further, rise in investment banking fees and stable equity trading income supported the top line.Riding on higher revenues, PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.1% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 16.2% increase from the prior-year quarter.Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin supported the company’s higher net interest income during the quarter. Also, non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, elevated expenses hurt results to some extent. Further, deterioration in credit quality was a headwind.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2381,WFC,"On Tuesday, U.S. banking regulators — the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (“FDIC”) — passed eight largest domestic banking organizations on their ""living wills"" after completing the evaluation of the resolution plans. These banks include Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report).However, both regulatory agencies have found some shortcomings in the plans of four banks out of the eight firms, which can be improved in the next resolution plan. These four globally important banks include BofA, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.""While significant progress has been made... there are inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with the resolution of a systemically important financial institution,"" the regulators noted.Notably, regulators demand improvement in four particular areas, including the management of derivatives, payment, clearing and settlement activities.Previously, in April 2016, resolution plans of five banks out of these eight were deficient, per the agencies.The plan, better known as “living will,” lays out the strategy for a company’s fast resolution under bankruptcy in the event of failure of the company or severe financial stress. Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the banks (with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more) are required to submit living wills. The main objective behind the submission of living will is to avoid re-run of the 2008 financial crisis and reduce risks of further bailouts.A systemic resolution, maximizing the sale value of a failed bank and minimizing creditor losses would help in efficient handling of bank failures. Moreover, the FDIC will have the power to liquidate a bank if its collapse knocks down the country’s financial stability.Notably, all eight firms require their next resolution plans to be submitted by July 1, 2019.Among these banks, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The regulators are working to improvise the resolution planning process. Therefore, it is expected that the submissions of annual resolution plan can be modified to once in two years in order to extend the time to prepare and review the plans.Bottom LineHypothetically, it is easy to say that resolution plans should be made in a way such that these do not adversely affect the overall financial system. However, in practice, it is difficult to mitigate the harm, as banks depend considerably on mutual businesses.Nevertheless, we believe ""Living Wills"" will help the regulators wind up banks, in case of failures, to some extent. Most importantly, the advance precautions will surely entail into lesser involvement of taxpayers’ money for bailing out troubled financial institutions.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2382,WFC,"Major indices regained stability following an erratic week that ended Feb 9. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 4.3%, marking the largest gain since the election of Trump. On top of that, the S&P 500 registered a gain of 4.3% over the last five trading sessions through the week ending Feb 16, the highest since 2013.It seems investors are no longer fretting over the spike in inflation rates but are instead focused on record-low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job addition. In fact, analysts believe that the record job additions and strong GDP data will help the indices maintain the bullish momentum.Investors should know that out of the 10 sectors tracking the S&P 500 index, the Financial industry rallied 4.7% last week. In particular, banks are poised to generate more profits from higher lending rates. In other words, the possibility of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed through 2018 will likely boost bank profits.Fed May Raise Rate AggressivelyPer the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index ticked up 0.5% through January 2018, beating market expectations of 0.3%. The index rose 2.1% over the past 12 months, indicating that the central bank might make an aggressive move to raise policy rates.Leading investment management firm BlackRock added that the central bank could lift policy rates three or four times in 2018. The rate hike will increase the borrowing cost, leading to the payment of higher interest to lenders. This is expected to ensure higher lending income for banks.Loans to GrowThe mid-month report of the University of Michigan shows that the U.S. consumer sentiment index for the month of February has not only touched a record high but has also risen more than market expectations.The index scaled 99.9 in February, surpassing the estimate of 95.5 made by Reuters economists. It also reflects the second-highest mark over the past 14 years. This clearly shows that consumers are more interested in the news of low unemployment, wage growth, and solid GDP data than the market's tumultuous movement. Hence, significant job addition and healthy consumer sentiments will boost the demand for loans and other related products of banks.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP is expected to jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate by Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the U.S. Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year over year in January 2017.Tax Reforms to Benefit BanksThe tax bill, which was signed into law last year, will likely benefit banks. Although major banks took a hit in the fourth quarter owing to non-recurring non-cash chargea related to the tax reform bill, financial institutions expect the reform to prove beneficial in the long term.During the fourth quarter, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) reported net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share. The results included a non-recurring non-cash charge related to the tax reform of $22 billion. However, Citigroup expects lower effective tax rate to drive net income.Moreover, with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) expects its effective tax rate to be 17% in the first quarter of 2018, 19% in 2018, and nearly 20% in the near term.Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) believe that the tax reform will likely lower their effective tax rates to 19% for 2018. Media reports claimed that the rate for 2018 will be significantly below the actual rate paid during 2016 and hence will increase the combined profit of banks by at least $7 billion this year.Which Stocks to Focus On?Picking bank stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy. We have narrowed down our search to the following four stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and other favorable parameters.Headquartered in New York, JPMorgan is a financial holding company with assets worth $2.53 trillion and stockholders’ equity worth $255.7 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.

The holding company’s long-term success is also underscored by its Class B shares BRKB, which also rest near their all-time highs.Attempting to mimic Berkshire Hathaway’s success would be tough, but what investors can do in order to try to invest like Buffett is to look at the company’s holdings and find stocks that fit their own strategies.Now, let’s take a look at three stocks with high Zacks Ranks that could help investors act more like Buffett:1.      Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report)Shares of the credit card giant have surged 45.54% in 2017, which more than doubles the S&P 500’s movement. Visa is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has received 16 upward earnings estimate revisions for its current full fiscal year against no downgrades—all within the last 60 days.Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Visa’s EPS is expected to jump 12.95% in its current quarter. Looking further ahead, Visa’s full-year fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to pop by 16.45%. On top of this bottom line growth, the credit card firm’s fiscal 2018 sales are expected to hit $20.09 billion, marking a 9.45% climb—which would be strong for a company of its size and age.Visa also boasts a cash flow growth rate of 20.74%, which doubles the “Financial Transaction Services” average and looks even better compared to rival Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). This growing cash position should help the company invest more in up-and-coming payment methods, including the quickly growing mobile payment sector where Visa already operates.2.       Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM score. Shares of the retail powerhouse have climbed 41% in 2017 and 23.69% in the last 12-weeks. Walmart has also recently proved that it is prepared to take on Amazon  after posting strong e-commerce and grocery sales.Walmart’s P/S ratio is currently 0.59, helping demonstrate that the retail powerhouse presents investors with a solid bang for their respective buck. On top of that, the company is trading at 22.11x earnings, which is comparable to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry average.Within the last 60 days, Walmart has experienced nine upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and 14 for its full-year. These earnings revisions are highly important and often prove to be a strong indicator of future performance. Walmart has beat or matched earnings estimates in 13 of the last 14 quarters, including each of the trailing nine periods.3.       American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report)Shares of American Express currently sit close to their 52-week high, after climbing 13% in the last 12 weeks to help the company’s current year gains reach 34.56%. But American Express could easily break into a new range if the company matches its bottom line growth projections.American Express is projected to see its fourth quarter 2017 earnings skyrocketed by 69.56% to hit $1.54 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s sales are also expected to gain nearly 9% to hit $8.73 billion in Q4.American Express is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that is trading at 17.02 earnings, which marks a discount against its industry’s average. The credit card company has also matched or topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing three quarters, as well as seven of the last eight.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

The new rate of interest will hover between 1.25% and 1.5%. This marks the fourth rate hike by Fed in a year’s time. Further, central bank officials reiterated their earlier projection of three possible rate hikes in 2018. Central bankers reasoned that a hike in interest rate would actually prevent the economy from overheating and negate the effects of a sudden increase in inflation.Also, the central bank did not alter its initial forecast for inflation. The Fed projects a gradual increase in inflation with officials forecasting that the year will end with inflation levels still below 2%. This also marked Janet Yellen’s last news conference as the Fed Chief before her term ends in February next year.Doug Jones’ Win Upsets Republican Advantage on Tax BillDemocrat candidate Doug Jones won the Senate elections in Alabama late on Tuesday. defeating Republican Roy Moore.

Financial stocks such as Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all declined 1.6%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively and led the S&P 500 lower.

2386,WFC,"On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced the third rate hike of 2017 at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The Fed was tempted by the strengthening economy as well as impressive labor market gains.The benchmark federal funds rate has been hiked to 1.25-1.50%, from 1.00-1.25% raised in June 2017. Notably, this is the fifth raise in interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, which led the Fed to lower rates to near zero.""The labor market has continued to strengthen and ... economic activity has been rising at a solid rate,"" the Federal Open Market Committee noted in a statement following its two-day meeting.Though policymakers have increased their expectations for economic growth in 2018, on the Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts, they continued with their projections of three hikes in 2018 and two hikes in 2019.“My colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists,” said Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman. She stated they expected the bill to provide “a modest lift.” “We continue to think that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants factoring in their assessment of the tax policy,” Yellen further added.The central bank projects economic growth at the rate of 2.5% in 2018, up from the previous expectation of 2.1%. Further, the growth rate is anticipated to be 2.1% in 2019 — moderately higher than the previous forecast of 2%.Further, based on the updated economic projections, Fed expects inflation to be at 1.7%, below its target of 2%. The unemployment rate is predicted to fall to 4.1% this year, down from the prior forecast of 4.3%. Also, it is estimated to decline to 3.9% in 2018, down from the previous projection of 4.1%.“Changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years,” Yellen said, adding that “the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain.”With decent economic growth and recent strong gains in the labor market, rate hike is an added advantage. However, there are temporary concerns over the weak inflation.In addition to the above, reiteration of number of rate hikes in 2018 and 2019 by the Fed officials disappointed the investors who were expecting more hikes on the likely strengthening of economic activity due to tax policy changes. Notably, Wall Street biggies including U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) edged down more than 1% following the rate hike announcement.Notably, U.S. Bancorp, BofA and Citigroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2387,WFC,"Yesterday, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) was served with another lawsuit on its plate by Navajo Nation, a Native American territory, for having exploited its “most vulnerable population” into opening accounts they did not require.It was only yesterday that investors were ready to put behind Wells Fargo’s disappointing past with renewed hopes on the banks’ performance, which is expected to get support from lower tax rates policy. The market’s positive attitude toward the San Francisco, CA-based bank helped it breach the 52-week high. However, this latest news of the bank’s misdeeds might act as a setback.Major AllegationsThis lawsuit can be considered a minor recap of the fake-accounts scandal Wells Fargo was involved in September 2016. The only difference being that the bank’s representatives fulfilled their sales targets by taking advantage of the elders who do not understand English. Also, they targeted the minors by opening accounts in their names and falsely reporting their ages.In fact, the bank has been accused of having pushed locals into opening unnecessary accounts by following them into events such as flea markets and basketball games.Russell Begaye, President of Navajo Nation, showed his disappointment in the bank by saying, “Wells Fargo’s actions toward the Navajo people have been of a uniquely outrageous nature.”John Hueston has been appointed as the attorney and is directed “to seek restitution, damages and civil penalties” for the wrong doings of the bank. The community has been deeply impacted by this as Wells Fargo is the only major bank that has branches in the area.Spokesperson of Wells Fargo refrained from comments on the matter.Our ViewpointCurrently, the bank has a lot to deal with on the litigation front. Further, Trump’s recent comments on Wells Fargo’s deeds are on legal matters reflect that the bank’s financial statements will be dominated by higher legal costs.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 9.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.8%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderEnterprise Financial Services Corporation (EFSC  -  Free Report) witnessed a 1.2% upward estimate revision for current-year earnings, over the last 60 days.

2388,WFC,"On Wednesday, Janet Yellen will hold her last press conference as Fed Chair after the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting draws to a close. Investors and market watchers are widely expecting the Fed to announce a quarter percentage point rate hike after this meeting. Stocks should witness short-term gains post this announcement even though markets have mostly priced in the rate hike call. Financial stocks and banks in particular have been strong performers this year with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index up 15.7% year to date. A near certain rate hike will only boost banks higher, which is why adding them to your portfolio looks like a smart option.Rate Hike Nearly CertainIf the Fed does indeed decide to hike rates, it will be the third such increase for 2017. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool puts the chances of a quarter point rate hike well above 90%, which makes an increase to 1.25% to 1.50% nearly certain. Of course, the Fed Chair has been hinting at a December rate hike for quite some time now, which is why analysts in general believe that such an occurrence has largely been priced in by equity markets.And last week’s non-farm payrolls possibly removed any doubts over the likelihood of a rate hike completely. The data-dependent Fed’s spirits were significantly lifted after U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in November, steering past expectations of 200,000. Also, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1% in November and continues to remain at a 17-year low. (Read: 4 Best Staffing Stocks to Buy on Blockbuster Jobs Report)Tax Cuts, Deregulation to Boost BanksMeanwhile, last week’s approval of the new tax legislation by the Senate is another big positive for U.S. banks. Per the new law, the corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. (Read: Senate Passes $4-Trillion Budget Blueprint: Top 5 Winners)Meanwhile, Yellen’s successor, Trump nominee Jerome Powell has said that he favors loosening regulations for banks. In his Senate confirmation hearing on Nov 29, Powell said certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act should be eased, particularly regulations pertaining to banks. Powell thinks these regulations had limited banks’ operational flexibility for a considerable period of time and should be removed soon.With the abolishment of these provisions, banks will no longer be mandated to maintain high levels of capital reserves. With more capital in the economy, lending will increase, which bodes well for banks. (Read: 5 Bank Stocks to Buy on Jerome H. Powell Testimony)Our ChoicesThis month’s near-certain rate hike will give yet another boost to bank margins. Also, the move to reduce corporate tax rates and deregulate the sector bodes well for bank profits. Moreover, it is now widely expected that the Fed will hike rates on three more occasions in 2018, a number which can only rise given the current scenario.This is why it makes good sense to pick select bank stocks at this point.

2389,WFC,"Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 5.8% in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Also, the bottom line compares favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 99 cents.Results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in loans balance remained major headwinds.After considering the charges from tax legislation of $107 million and other adjustments, the company reported net income of $112 million in the fourth quarter.For full-year 2017, adjusted earnings per share were $4.73 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70. Also, earnings compared favorably with the prior-year figure of $3.02. For 2017, net income of $743 million was reported, up 55.8% year over year.Segment wise, on a year-over-year basis, its Retail Bank performed well. It reported net income of $21 million against net loss of $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, net income increased 9.1% at Wealth Management while it declined 14.1% at Business Bank. The Finance segment incurred a net loss of $2 million compared with net loss of $60 million in the prior-year quarter.Increase in Revenues Partly Offset by Higher Expenses  For 2017, the company reported revenues of $3.17 billion, up 11.2% on a year-over-year basis. Results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.16 billion.Comerica’s revenues for the quarter were $830 million, up 15% year over year. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $819.6 million. The increase in revenues was supported by expanded net interest margin and higher fee income.Net interest income increased 19.8% on a year-over-year basis to $545 million. Moreover, net interest margin expanded 63 basis points (bps) to 3.28%.Total non-interest income came in at $285 million, up 6.7% year over year. Increased card fees, fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts primarily led to the rise.Further, non-interest expenses totaled $483 million, up 4.8% year over year. The rise was chiefly due to higher salaries, advertising and software expenses, partly offset by lower restructuring expenses.Loans Decline, Deposits IncreaseAs of Dec 31, 2017, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $71.6 billion and $8 billion, respectively, compared with $73 billion and $7.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Total loans were down slightly on a sequential basis, to $49.2 billion. However, total deposits increased marginally from the previous quarter to $57.9 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets decreased 31.6% year over year to $415 million. Also, allowance for loan losses was $712 million, down 2.5% from the prior-year period. Additionally, allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1.45% as of Dec 31, 2017, down 4 bps year over year.Moreover, net loan charge-offs decreased 55.6% on a year-over-year basis to $16 million. In addition, provision for credit losses declined 51.4% to $17 million.Capital Position StrengthensThe company's tangible common equity ratio improved 43 bps year over year to 10.32% as of Dec 31, 2017. Further, common equity Tier 1 and tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.55%, up from 11.09% in the prior-year quarter. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.71%, up 44 bps from the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateNotably, during the reported quarter, Comerica repurchased 1.9 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $200 million to shareholders.For 2017, the company repurchased 7.3 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. It returned a total of $724 million to its shareholders in the year.Impressive Outlook for Full-Year 2018Comerica provided guidance for full-year 2018 assuming continuation of the current economic environment and low rates, along with $270 million of benefits from the GEAR Up initiative.The company anticipates net interest income to benefit from loan growth and increase in interest rates. Full-year benefit from the rate hikes in 2017 is expected to be $110-$125 million (assuming a 20-40% deposit beta for the December rate increase). Notably, elevated interest recoveries of $28 million in 2017 are not expected in 2018.Non-interest income is expected to increase 4%, benefitting from GEAR Up opportunities, which will drive modest growth in treasury management, card fees, brokerage fees and fiduciary income. This expectation excludes deferred compensation of $8 million in 2017.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be up 1%, affected by restructuring expenses of about $47-$57 million and an additional $50 million benefit from the GEAR Up initiatives. Also, expenses related to revenue growth such as outside processing expenses are likely to increase. Pressure will also be created from higher technology expenses and inflationary conditions.Provision for credit losses is expected to reflect continued solid performance in its overall portfolio. Notably, net charge-offs are expected to remain low while provisions are expected to be in the range of 20-25 bps.Income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately 23% of pre-tax income on the assumption of no tax impact from employee stock transactions.Comerica expects average loans to increase in line with the gross domestic product, reflecting rise in most lines of business while remaining stable in Energy and Corporate Banking.Our ViewpointComerica reported another strong quarter. The company remains well poised to benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Additionally, its strong capital position continues to lend support. Further, the top line continues to benefit from easing pressure on margins. Lower tax rates and improving economic conditions are likely to continue supporting its financials going forward.Comerica Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Comerica Incorporated Quote Currently, Comerica sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2390,WFC,"The euphoria over the Republican-led tax overhaul policy helped the Dow persistently hit record highs and book back-to-back weekly gains. This epic Dow rally is likely to get a boost from a stellar Q4 earnings season. Strong guidance and an upbeat economic scenario are cited to be some of the primary reasons that will help earnings pick up steam.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season seems judicious. Such stocks, moreover, are positioned to report promising earnings results as they have strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Jones to Hit Record High Post HolidayDow futures soared triple digits on Jan 15, when the U.S. stock market was closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Dow has already booked two straight weekly gains, as well as registered seven positive weeks in the last eight. The Dow jumped almost 4.4% and posted its best start to a year since the first nine trading sessions of 2003.The 30-stock index demonstrated mostly nothing in the way of gyration or market pullbacks. In fact, the broader market shrugged off uncertainty over the past 12 months. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), quiet remarkably, registered 47 lowest closings last year, out of a total of 56 since its inception in 1990.Tax Package: A Boon for Blue ChipsThe enthusiasm over tax cuts fueled a strong rally in blue-chip stocks. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Q4 Earnings Growth Expected to be StrongerSuch blue-chip stocks’ stupendous start could get even more wings as the Q4 earnings season kicks off. Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. This would follow 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues (read more: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings).Q4 earnings estimates for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil and gas output is expected to benefit the energy sector, while an increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Tech, in the meanwhile, will make headway from substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (read more: 5 Best Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings Season).Healthy Economic DataA sound economy is further likely to support earnings growth. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company, has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.The unemployment rate, in the meanwhile, is at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November 2017. Lest we forget, workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month.Such low jobless level, rise in income and more confident consumers increased spending further at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants (read more: Retailers Cap a Robust Holiday-Shopping Season: 5 Must Buys).4 Blue Chips to Buy NowThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks.

They have a positive Earnings ESP — our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2391,WFC,"Today marks the national domestic holiday for Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On what would have been his 89th birthday, Dr. King is remembered for helping bring Civil Rights to people of color in the U.S. This April will mark the 50th anniversary of his assassination.King is also known for his highly inspirational speeches, and quotes such as, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” Words to live by, whether as a Civil Rights trailblazer, a soldier, a teacher or an experienced stock market investor.When markets open again tomorrow morning, we look forward to plenty of new Q4 earnings reports, largely from more of the big banks, continuing what began on Friday: Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), among others. Other industries will also be represented, such as healthcare — UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — and transportation — CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report).As we saw Friday with Q4 reports from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), we expect one-time charges and gains due to the recently passed tax cut laws. This is anticipated to be especially true at Citi, where analysts expect a $20 billion one-time charge at the bank major.For more on what to expect from the big banks and other companies reporting quarterly earnings this week and beyond, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: JPMorgan’s Positive Kick-Off to Bank EarningsFollowing Friday’s close at fresh record highs, holiday futures trading shows even stronger markets ahead: the Dow is up triple digits currently, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are marginally in the green. Should this trajectory continue into tomorrow morning, look for the Dow to be within striking distance of 26,000. This is an extraordinary rise in value; at this point a year ago, market participants were hoping to see the index crack the 20K level.

2392,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax bill last Saturday, driving investors’ optimism over bank stocks. A significant drop in the corporate tax rate — from 35% to 20% — is one of the major changes proposed in the tax bill.Though low client activities and less volatility across capital markets are expected to hurt banks’ trading revenues in Q4, overall earnings performance is likely to improve on the back of lower taxes.Further, expectations of another rate hike soon, backed by improving U.S. economic data, have boosted investors’ confidence. Mortgage rates increased last week on a bonds sell-off, hitting 3.94%, but remained historically low. In addition, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.367%.Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, acquisitions and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts prevailed over the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Dec 1, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. Major banks expect weak trading revenues in the fourth quarter. At the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) hinted at continued weakness in trading revenues. This is the third time in 2017 that both companies have provided dismal outlook for trading revenues.Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, stated that the company’s trading business so far this quarter has been down nearly 15% year over year. Lake noted that “there haven’t been that many catalysts” and volatility remains ""low across the spectrum.""Likewise, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan predicted the same decline for his company. Both executives cited discouraging comparisons to last year, when volatility was significantly high following the U.S. Presidential election results. Notably, remarks by these executives echo similar comments made in November by Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) CFO Martin Chavez, who said, “The market backdrop that has been in place since the beginning of the year has continued into the fourth quarter. Volatility continues to be low, and client activity continues to be subdued.” (Read more: Banks Appear Unlikely to Benefit From Trading Turnaround)John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) at Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), also foresees a decline in the company’s trading revenues by high teens in the fourth quarter. Also, Trump’s tax reform move is likely to affect the bank’s earnings by a solid $20 million as a one-time charge, after it is enforced as law. He also expects credit card revenues to remain flat in the fourth quarter due to pressure from the recent marketing costs.However, the CFO seemed hopeful about return on tangible common equity, expecting it to rise in 2019 and 2020 due to lower taxes that will result in higher income.

Moody's Investors Service — the rating service arm of Moody's Corp. — affirms or upgrades the major banks’ ratings based on performance and earnings strength.

Additionally, the deposits and senior debt rating of its subsidiary, Bank of America N.A., has been upgraded from A1 to Aa3. Its baseline credit assessment has also been upgraded to baa1 from baa2.On the other hand, short-term ratings and assessments of the company and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by Moody's. Notably, the rating outlook is stable. BofA has witnessed improvement in its profitability in the last few years. Moody’s expects the company to sustain this bottom-line growth in the future as well.

The California Department of Insurance plans to revoke or at least suspend Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) insurance license due to its illegitimate practices relating to the online insurance referral program. The regulator noted that about 1500 fake insurance policies were opened by the company without customers’ knowledge. Wells Fargo is said to have wrongly charged them with premiums.Earlier this week, the banking giant’s CEO Tim Sloan commented on the regular screening of its operations during the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. He had said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” This adds to the many other problems the bank has been facing since the fake accounts scandal surfaced in late 2016.  (Read more: Wells Fargo's Insurance License Likely to Get Revoked)4. Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) has been accused of charging illegal overdraft fees from customers. Per a Reuters report, a federal appeals court recently revived the proposed class-action lawsuit, which had been filed against the company earlier for its wrongdoing. According to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, the rules for charging overdraft fee of Capital One were quite confusing and ambiguous.Thus, a lower court judge had wrongly dismissed a breach of contract claim. Ideally, if a bank pays its merchant for purchases made by customers, who do not have enough money in their accounts, it charges an overdraft fee of nearly $35.

Amid ongoing developments in the U.S. banking sector, CEO Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo is optimistic on the loan scenario in the fourth quarter based on improved customer activity. During the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Sloan commented on the regular screening of the bank’s operations. He said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” According to him, some other areas of mistakes might standout as the bank continues to make improvements.Further, growth in economy is likely to have spurred some customer activity on the consumer and commercial front during the quarter. He expects consumer activity to gain momentum when Trump becomes successful in enforcing the tax bill. In the third quarter, the bank reported nearly 1% drop in its loan portfolio, year over year.He anticipates the commercial and industrial (C&I) lending scenario to be better in the fourth quarter. However, he expects the mortgage segment to be impacted by seasonality during the last quarter, resulting in sluggish growth. Sloan anticipates the auto lending segment to improve late next year.

2393,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The 10-year Treasury bond yields escalated at four-year highs on higher-than-expected inflation. Positive economic growth, along with central banks’ moves globally to improve interest rates from ultra-low levels, boosted yields which supported bank stocks, encouraging investors to focus more on bank stocks.Additionally, investors’ confidence received a boost from President Trump’s much-awaited $200-billion infrastructure plan that rolled out earlier this week.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, hitting a nearly four-year high of 4.38%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increase in mortgage rates will limit reduce refinancing activity.Further, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts persisted in the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

The bank has been slapped with charges of failing to have put together proper anti-money laundering (AML) control programs, along with intentionally keeping itself from reporting a suspicious activity to the authorities.For a period of nearly six years (ended 2014), U.S. Bancorp was found to have been using weak AML measures. The bank limited the number of suspicious activities that could be identified by its monitoring systems due to limited number of employees present to track them.4. Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) chief executive officer, Brian T. Moynihan, received a 15% hike in his total compensation for 2017.

2394,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has been restructuring its credit and debit cards processing venture with First Data Corp (FDC) for small businesses. The company laid off about 50 employees from the venture’s sales department.Wells Fargoseesthis move as a way to align the number of employees with current volumes. Also, it remains committed to providing new jobs to the affected employees within Wells Fargo, as possible.Per Sara Hassell, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, these layoffs remain unrelated to the company’s digitization move coming up in 2018 in the form of a mobile app for the small-business merchant-services customers.Wells Fargo Merchant Services charges a fee for transaction processing and a commission from First Data on equipment leases and sales. In August 2017, a federal lawsuit was filed against the joint venture, alleging it of misleading thousands of merchants by charging them unauthorized fees.Since the breakout of sales practice scandal last year in September, Wells Fargo has laid off a considerable number of employees. Also, it has shut down branches to cope with high litigation costs.The bank remains under heightened scrutiny by the authorities. Recently, Securities and Exchange Commission imposed a $3.5 million civil penalty on Wells Fargo’s Advisory wing.Recently, Wells Fargo along with American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) formed TruSight — a company designed to combine best practices and simplify the process of conducting third-party risk assessments of suppliers and partners across the financial services industry.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 1.9% year to date versus the industry’s rally of 8.9%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2395,WFC,"In a policy reversal by the banking regulator, examiners will continue working at banks they supervise. In a statement to Bloomberg News, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) head Joseph Otting said, “Upon review, it is not practical to continue the agency’s efforts to move resident examiners out of on-site locations.”High cost of independent real estate and the burden examiners will likely face in moving back and forth between government offices and Wall Street banks were cited as the reasons for halting the effort.Otting commented that other measures such as rotating examiners from bank to bank show that the OCC is serious about stopping ‘regulatory capture.’ He said, “The agency will continue to review its locations and real estate strategy to ensure they support the agency’s mission in the most operationally and cost-effective manner possible.”For years, the OCC has been intending to move hundreds of in-house examiners who worked at offices of big banks including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). The primary aim to remove examiners from on-site locations was to prevent them from becoming lenient in scrutinizing banking operations.Notably, former OCC head Thomas Curry led the efforts to remove in-house supervisors. He intended to leave a small number of examiners on site while moving the others to neutral locations.In reality, no significant progress seems to have been made on this front. According to the regulator, nearly 65% of the major bank examiners remain on-site. In fact, this number has risen over the last couple of years.So, though at present banks are not expected to reap any benefits from the change in policy, there are chances that they might gain in the long run. With supervisors remaining on-site, there are chances that they might not report business misconducts and banks may take undue risks.Also, the plan indicates that banking regulators are gradually trying to lessen Wall Street oversight (one of the big electoral promise made by President Donald Trump) despite not making any real progress on that front.Of the above-mentioned big banks, JPMorgan, Citigroup and BofA carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2397,WFC,"John Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), foresees a decline in the company’s trading revenues by high teens in the fourth quarter. Also, Trump’s tax reform move is likely to affect its earnings by a solid $20 million as a one-time charge, after it is enforced as law.He also expects credit card revenues to remain flat in the fourth quarter because of pressure from the recent marketing costs.Shares of Citigroup closed 1.4% lower yesterday, reflecting investors’ reaction on Gerspach’s subdued comments for the upcoming results during an investor conference held by Goldman Sachs.However, the CFO seemed hopeful about return on tangible common equity, expecting it to rise in 2019 and 2020 due to lower taxes that will result in higher income.Let’s take a look at the factors impacting the key components:Lower Trading RevenuesPer Gerspach, the low level of volatility in the fourth quarter, particularly compared to last year when market was reacting actively to the U.S. election, has taken a toll on Citigroup’s trading revenues.Fixed income and foreign exchange segments, on which the company is depends significantly, are likely to have been affected the most. He also said that the local markets performed better when compared with the group of 10 developed countries.Impact of Tax Bill Citigroup would be forced to discard $20 million saved-up tax credits once the tax bill gets implemented.During its Investor Day in July 2017, the company estimated an impact of $15 billion on assumptions of corporate taxes being brought down to 25% and one-time repatriation of overseas earnings.However, as the Senate bill proposes a tax rate of 20%, around $16 million of deferred tax assets will have to be written down. Further, taxes on repatriating foreign income could amount to about $4 billion.Gerspach expects this move to be positive for the banks in the long term. He said, “Lower tax rates and changes in taxation of income earned overseas are expected to ultimately yield higher returns.”Credit Card RevenuesGerspach also said that he expects revenues from Citi-branded credit cards in North America to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Pressure has been put on the revenues due to the company’s extensive marketing strategy.Citigroup countered its peers by giving a 21 months interest free time period to its customers on balances that are transferred from other cards. Thus, higher promotional balances are likely to be at play in fourth-quarter results.Outlook Provided by Other Major BanksAmong the other banks present at the conference, executives of JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) expressed concerns over lower volatility across capital markets that might hurt banks’ trading revenues in 2017. However, both the banks predicted top-line growth for the fourth quarter.

2398,WFC,"No one person’s commentary about the stock market commands quite as much attention as that of Warren Buffett. Of course, the “Oracle of Omaha” has certainly earned that level of respect, amassing billions of dollars over decades of meticulous investing. But this also means that when Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) reports its latest holdings, investors often move quickly to copy its recent moves.Berkshire filed its 13F for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, providing the would-be Buffetts of the world with an update on the conglomerate’s latest adjustments and giving Wall Street the closest thing to a look inside the mind of the billionaire investor that it could possibly have.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. Some of the company’s larger stakes include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of American (BAC  -  Free Report), and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).During the fourth quarter, the portfolio’s value increased about 8%, reaching a whopping $191 billion on the back of one major new addition and several position increases. Should you be following in Buffett’s footsteps by buying the same stocks? Let’s take a closer look.Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by about 23% during the quarter. The technology behemoth is now the portfolio’s largest holding at 14.63% of its total value. Berkshire first purchased AAPL in Jan. 2016, and when asked to explain the move at the time, Buffet responded by simply saying, “Because I liked it.”Apple is currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has been hammered by the recent market sell-off, which occurred just days after the company reported disappointing iPhone sales during the holiday quarter. Nevertheless, the stock is sporting a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and the fact that it presents such a rare value opportunity in the tech sector probably explains Buffett’s position.Shares of Apple are trading at just 15x forward earnings, coming in slightly below the market-wide average. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of 1.26, so investors are getting a decent price for its growth aspirations as well. Apple’s P/S of 3.55 is a bit stretched, but the company remains a cash cow and is generating more than $11.30 in cash per share right now, significantly outpacing its industry peers.Apple remains a strong buy-and-hold option for investors focusing on financial security and value. The firm’s dominant grip on the consumer tech industry might be slipping a bit, but Apple should remain a titan for years to come.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report)Buffett and Berkshire took the bulk of their position in BNY Mellon during the second quarter of 2012. Since then, the size of the holding has fluctuated a bit, including several small decreases in 2015 and two 50% increases in 2017. The conglomerate also upped its stake in BK by about 20% during the fourth quarter, buying a number of shares between $51 and $55.BNY Mellon has performed basically in line with the market over the past year, moving a respectable 18% higher over that time. The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has an overall VGM grade of “D.”Investors should not expect explosive earnings growth or consistent market-beating returns from BNY Mellon. But the stock is probably a decent option for investors looking to diversify their financial holdings with a sound asset servicing company.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA  -  Free Report)Berkshire surprised many investors with the revelation that it had taken a new stake in this struggling drugmaker during the fourth quarter. Its position is relatively small and accounts for just 0.9% of the portfolio’s value, but it led many on Wall Street to question whether Buffett could see something in the stock that others were missing.The generic drug giant has faced significant headwinds lately, due in large part to lower U.S. generic drug prices and increased competition—causing management to take out massive loans to protect from its shrinking profit margins.Berkshire could be well positioned to benefit from the company’s planned turnaround, but investors should note that Teva is currently holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nevertheless, the Zacks Rank is only a one-to-three month indicator, and we know that Buffett likes to buy and hold his stocks well beyond that. Teva might be risky right now, but if the company can solve its debt crisis, it could bounce back over the next few years.Want more analysis from this author?

2399,WFC,"Monday, January 15, 2018Today marks the national domestic holiday for Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On what would have been his 89th birthday, Dr. King is remembered for helping bring Civil Rights to people of color in the U.S. This April will mark the 50th anniversary of his assassination.King is also known for his highly inspirational speeches, and quotes such as, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” Words to live by, whether as a Civil Rights trailblazer, a soldier, a teacher or an experienced stock market investor.When markets open again tomorrow morning, we look forward to plenty of new Q4 earnings reports, largely from more of the big banks, continuing what began on Friday: Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), among others. Other industries will also be represented, such as healthcare — UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — and transportation — CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report).As we saw Friday with Q4 reports from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), we expect one-time charges and gains due to the recently passed tax cut laws. This is anticipated to be especially true at Citi, where analysts expect a $20 billion one-time charge at the bank major. For more on what to expect from the big banks and other companies reporting quarterly earnings this week and beyond, check out Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview: JPMorgan’s Positive Kick-Off to Bank EarningsFollowing Friday’s close at fresh record highs, holiday futures trading shows even stronger markets ahead: the Dow is up triple digits currently, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are marginally in the green. Should this trajectory continue into tomorrow morning, look for the Dow to be within striking distance of 26,000. This is an extraordinary rise in value; at this point a year ago, market participants were hoping to see the index crack the 20K level.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2401,WFC,"Several large banking institutions, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), released their latest quarterly results on Friday, marking the unofficial start of busy fourth-quarter earnings report cycle.In the coming weeks, we will see reports from the world’s biggest and most relevant companies, meaning that investors need to be prepared for the ensuing movement that is likely to occur throughout the market.According to the latest report from Sheraz Mian, the head of the Zacks Equity Research department and an acknowledged earnings expert, earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors—and growth rates are projected to hit the double digits for our Energy, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, and Automotive groups.Meanwhile, the revisions trend for Q4 earnings estimates has been favorable compared to recent quarters. Total earnings growth is now expected to touch 8.8%, up from a projected 8.4% just two months ago.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of January 15.1.       CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report)Rail transportation giant CSX Corporation is scheduled to release its latest earnings report after the market closes on January 16. Shares of CSX have been on a strong run over that past year, gaining roughly 53%. The company has met or surpassed earnings estimates in 15 consecutive quarters, and the stock is carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into its report date.Our latest consensus estimates are calling for CSX to post earnings of 56 cents per share and revenues of $2.88 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of +14.29% and -5.23%, respectively. CSX’s focus has been efficiency, so investors should keep their eyes on margins and free cash flow. Service disruptions could have an effect on the firm’s top line, but earnings growth should still be present. 2.       Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report)Investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs is slated to announce its latest quarterly results before the market opens on January 17. Goldman shares have gained just 5% over the past year, but the stock has moved nearly 7% higher within the past 12 weeks. The firm has met or surpassed earnings estimates in two straight quarters and is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect Goldman to report earnings of $4.90 per share and revenues of $7.63 billion. These results would represent growth rates of -3.54% and -6.60%, respectively. Goldman has struggled with a lack of volatility throughout global markets, and a one-time charge related to the new tax bill’s consideration of overseas profits will impact this quarter. Still, cost control efforts have been commendable and could support the bottom line. 3.       IBM Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report)Information technology player IBM is set to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on January 18. The stock has dipped more than 2% over the past year, although shares have rebounded nearly 7% within the past four weeks. IBM has met or surpassed earnings estimates in 12 consecutive quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into its report date.Our current consensus estimates are calling for IBM to report earnings of $5.17 per share and revenues of $21.96 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of +3.19% and +0.87%, respectively. IBM has been dealing with slumping revenues for years now, so seeing an uptick in quarterly sales would be encouraging. If it comes, it will likely be due to continued strength in the company’s cloud and IoT projects. Want more analysis from this author?

2402,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of 96 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate came in at $1.04.Including $3.35 billion after-tax benefit, or 67 cents, from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, $848 million pre-tax gain, or 11 cents from the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services and $3.25 billion pre-tax expense, or 59 cents related to litigation accruals, net income came in at $6.2 billion or $1.16 per share.Non-interest income recorded growth, partially offset by fall in net interest income. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Notably, lower mortgage income was also a negative. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.For the year ended 2017, earnings per share were $4.10, up 11 cents compared with the prior year. Results also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.98.The quarter’s total revenues were $22.1 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.4 billion. However, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $21.6 billion.Revenues for the year ended 2017 were $88.4 billion, slightly increasing year over year. However, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments’ total quarterly revenues increased around 2.6% and 4.9%, respectively, while Wholesale Banking revenues edged down around 1.4%.Loans & Interest Income Fall, Non-Interest Income Up, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.3 billion, down 1% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities and loans, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin contracted 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.84%.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, up 6% year over year, primarily due to higher net gains from equity investments and debt securities, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues.As of Dec 31, 2017, total loans were $956.8 billion, down around 1.1% year over year. Reduction in consumer as well as commercial loan portfolio was recorded. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $16.8 billion, up 27% from the year-earlier quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from rise in employee benefits and other expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reductions of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 76.2% came in above the 61.2% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the reported quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 4% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $651 million, declining 19.1% year over year. Net charge-offs were $751 million or 0.31% of average loans in the fourth quarter, down 17% from the year-ago quarter’s net charge-offs of $805 million (0.37%). Non-performing assets were down 23.7% to $8.7 billion in the quarter under review from $11.4 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In 2017, the company returned $14.5 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Notably, in the reported quarter, the banking giant repurchased 51.4 million shares of its common stock.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $154 billion from $146.4 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.9% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with 10.8% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $37.44 from $35.18 recorded in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointTop-line headwinds, aided by lower net interest income, were perceived. Furthermore, flaring up expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business. Nevertheless, improved credit quality and tax benefit were positives.Despite several legal tensions, Wells Fargo remains focused on maintaining its financial position. Last year, the banking giant doubled its cost-cutting targets to combat escalating expenses. These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders.We believe, over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also anticipate strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help it expand its business and enhance profitability.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2403,WFC,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, Q4 earnings season finally gets rolling this Friday. Though we have seen companies like Delta and Fed Ex report for the quarter in the past days and weeks, this morning we see a flock of banks and investment firms all reporting Q4 numbers, signaling the next three weeks of heavy earnings data to be reported ahead.First up, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 7 cents per share, coming in at $1.76. (This, by the way, excludes a 69 cent-per-share impact — $2.4 billion — as a result of the pending tax reform laws.) Revenues in the quarter reached $25.5 billion, versus the $25.0 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company returned a total of $67 billion to shareholders in 2017, by way of share buybacks and dividend yields. These numbers illustrate a healthy quarter — augmented a bit by a big drop in Fixed Income Markets (-27%) — with a very positive outlook. For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report) posted strong Q4 results, putting up $6.24 per share versus the $6.08 consensus estimate, on $3.47 billion in revenues that outpaced the $3.35 billion expected. From a top-line standpoint, this represents gains of 20% year over year. Fiscal year earnings hit $22.60 per share, +17% year over year. For more on BLK’s earnings, click here.However, we see a mixed report for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) this morning. The Zacks Rank #3 bank topped earnings estimates, posting $1.16 versus $1.07 anticipated, but missed on revenues — $22,050 million compared with the $22,381 million in the Zacks consensus estimate. The company is also still trying to win back trust from customers following its fake accounts scandal.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) also surpassed estimates for its Q4 sales and earnings — $2.29 per share beat the $2.20 we had been looking for, where revenues of $4.26 billion outperformed the expected $4.17 billion. This amounts to top-line gains of 10% year over year. For more on PNC’s earnings, click here.Consumer Price Index & Retail SalesFinally today, another couple key metrics from a domestic economic standpoint: both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales reads hit the tape ahead of today’s open. The CPI read follows the Producer Price Index (PPI) for December, which came in lower than expected.For the CPI headline we see +0.1%, lower than the +0.3% we were looking for but at least still in positive territory. Ex-food & energy, this number does hit 0.3%. Year over year we see CPI growth of 2.1%, down a tick from November’s read. These numbers appear lukewarm, but are at least a little hotter than the PPI figures we saw earlier.Retail Sales came in-line with expectations at +0.4%, following a by-most-accounts strong holiday shopping season. Ex-auto sales — as well as ex-autos & gas — this figure stays at 0.4%. Not only that, but the prior retail headline, from before the holidays, was revised considerably upward, from 0.8% last read to 1.4% this morning. We may see these numbers manifest in quarterly earnings for retailers, but we’re about a month away from seeing those reports come in.

2404,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement with Popular (BPOP  -  Free Report) to divest certain assets and liabilities of its auto finance business in Puerto Rico. The all cash deal is expected to close by mid-2018.Wells Fargo’s auto lending segment landed in trouble last year when its customers were financially hurt due to issues related to auto Collateral Protection Insurance policies. Per its fourth-quarter earnings release, auto loan originations fell nearly 33% on a year-over-year basis.Terms of the DealThe deal has been valued at $1.7 billion which reflects a 4.5% discount on the value of assets that are to be sold.Reliable Financial Services and Reliable Finance Holding Company, subsidiaries of Wells Fargo, will sell about $1.5 billion in retail auto loans and $340 million in commercial loans to the banking subsidiary of Popular, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico.Past DivesturesRecently, Wells Fargo divested its Shareowner Services business to Equiniti Group plc for $227 million. Equiniti Group is the leading provider of share registration and associated investor services in the United Kingdom.Further, in November 2017, the bank completed the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA to USI Insurance Services. The motive behind this divesture was to bring banking activities back into focus.Our ViewpointWells Fargo has been trimming its operations ever since its downward journey started after the fake account scandal in September 2016. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve put a cap of $2 trillion on its assets. This is likely to further push the bank into concentrating on core operations.Though litigation costs will continue to be burden in the near term, the bank’s cost-cutting initiatives might lend some support to its financials. Also, its strong capital position and much attentive management might keep it from falling into trouble again.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 13% over the past six months, underperforming 15.4% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A couple of stocks worth considering in the same space are The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report),both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PNC Financial has increased 3.1% for the current year, in the last 30 days. The company’s share price has increased 24.7% in the past year.Citigroup has witnessed 4.7% upward earnings estimate revision for 2018, in the last 30 days. Its share price has risen 27% in the past year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2405,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) rose 2% yesterday driven by the optimistic comments of CEO Tim Sloan on loan scenario in the fourth quarter based on improved customer activity.Despite several legal tensions, Wells Fargo remains focused on maintaining its financial position. In May 2017, it doubled its cost-cutting targets to combat escalating expenses. These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders.During the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Sloan commented on the regular screening of the bank’s operations. He said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” According to him, some other areas of mistakes might standout as the bank continues to make improvements.Key TakeawaysSloan is optimistic of the economic growth in the last quarter of 2017 due to the progress on tax reforms and a favorable interest rate environment.Growth in economy is likely to have spurred some customer activity on the consumer and commercial front during the quarter. He expects customer activity to gain momentum when Trump becomes successful in enforcing the tax bill.Another major takeaway from the conference was about his thoughts on loan growth. In the third quarter, the bank had reported nearly 1% drop in its loan portfolio, year over year. He expects commercial and industrial (C&I) lending scenario to be better in the fourth quarter.However, he expects the mortgage segment to be impacted by seasonality during the last quarter, resulting in sluggish growth.Sloan anticipates the auto lending segment to improve late next year.Our TakeThe fake accounts fallout marked the beginning of the bank’s downward journey. Despite efforts to maintain financial health, Wells Fargo’s expense base is likely to continue impacting its financials for some time, primarily due to high legal costs.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 6.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.7%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderEnterprise Financial Services Corporation (EFSC  -  Free Report) witnessed a 1.2% upward estimate revision for current-year earnings, over the last 60 days.

Ex-auto sales — as well as ex-autos & gas — this figure stays at 0.4%. Not only that, but the prior retail headline, from before the holidays, was revised considerably upward, from 0.8% last read to 1.4% this morning. We may see these numbers manifest in quarterly earnings for retailers, but we’re about a month away from seeing those reports come in.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2408,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bearish. Expected delays in corporate tax reform and a flattening of the yield curve drove investor pessimism over bank stocks.Earlier this week, Democrats won elections in Virginia and New Jersey, which indicates increased prospects for their representatives in next year's midterm elections. This development increases investor apprehension, as this might challenge Republicans' plans of lessening regulations for banks. Expected weakness in economic numbers also added to the woes.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 3.9%, awaiting tax-reform results. Notably, concerns rose after the message sent by Republicans last week, “We think homeowners and home buyers have gotten much too sweet a deal from the federal tax code for far too long — and now we’re going to whack them down.”Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations and increased digital offerings persisted over the last five trading days.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 27, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. Amid ongoing restructuring in the banking sector to propel revenues and reduce costs, recently Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) announced it will stop originating mortgage and home equity loans, as heightened competition has made it difficult to remain profitable. The bank will lay off 950 employees as a result of its exit from this business.However, the company will continue to service its existing home loans. Capital One is also closing a call center that employs about 200 workers, as they have experienced a decline in call volume with customers being more comfortable with its mobile app and other modes of communication with the bank.

Moody's Investors Service — the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation — downgraded Capital One’s outlook from stable to negative. The company’s senior unsecured debt ratings were affirmed at Baa1. Additionally, the deposit ratings for its subsidiaries were confirmed at A1/negative/Prime-1. Moody’s believes exceptional loan growth over the years has led to increased charge-offs particularly in credit card and C&I portfolios, which resulted in a decline in the profitability of the company and increased risk levels.

2410,WFC,"Welcome to the ninth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business of Major League Soccer ahead of Saturday’s championship matchup between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC.The MLS has grown in both size and stature in recent years. Just last week, the MLS announced four cities—Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville, and Sacramento—as finalists for two new expansion franchises, with a whopping $150 million price tag attached.On top of that, the league’s TV ratings and attendance numbers have climbed in 2017. Team valuations also continue to rise, as notable owners from the NFL and NBA, such as Robert Kraft and Paul Allen, help inspire other billionaires to get in on the growth of MLS.The league’s TV partners—Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Univision, and others—broadcasted more games than ever before, many in new primetime spots on flagship channels.Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is firmly committed to MLS and growing the sport of soccer in the U.S. The German sportswear giant keeps on pouring money into the league through jersey deals and youth development.MLS is also a corporate sponsors dream, given the ability to advertise directly on team jerseys. This is something Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and many others have embraced. Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also all current MLS partners and sponsors.Still, despite all of these positive signs and real growth, many people around the U.S. question the current and long-term viability of the relatively young MLS.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

2411,WFC,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 88 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 84 cents.Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter. Moreover, revenues improved on a year-over-year basis aided by rise in net interest income. Further, elevated average loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses, lower mortgage banking revenues and provisions were major drags.Net income was $1.6 billion, up 3.5% year over year.Revenues, Loans & Deposits Growth Recorded, Costs & Provisions Flare UpU.S. Bancorp’s net revenues came in at around $5.6 billion in the quarter, up 4.1% year over year. The increase in net interest income was partly offset by lower non-interest income. Also, revenues came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 8.3% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates.Average earning assets climbed 3.8% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.10% was up 12 basis points year over year, driven by higher interest rates and loan portfolio mix. Higher funding costs and elevated cash balances partially mitigated rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income edged down around 1% on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion. The decline was primarily due to lower merchant processing services, mortgage banking revenues and reduced securities gains.Provision for credit losses increased 10.8% year over year to $360 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 3% year over year to $277.6 billion. The growth was stemmed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, total other retail and credit card loans. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate and covered loans. Excluding covered loans, average total loans rose 3.3% year over year.Average total deposits were up 5.2% from the prior-year quarter to $335.2 billion. The upsurge was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 3.7% year over year to $3 billion at U.S. Bancorp. The upsurge in mostly all components of non-interest expenses was partially offset by lower professional services, marketing and business development expenses along with other intangibles.Deteriorating Credit QualityCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $330 million, up 4.8% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment.Total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, slightly up on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets (excluding covered assets) came in at $1.3 billion, down 23.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position. Effective Jan 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements for the company comply with Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by Jan 1, 2018.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 11.1%, in line with the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.8% as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 12.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 7.5% as of Sep 30, 2016.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $25.98 as of Sep 30, 2017, from $24.78 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the third quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 79% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks. It came within the company’s long-term goal of returning 60-80% to its shareholders.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted a decent quarter. Along with elevated revenues, a solid capital position and increased lending activities were added advantages. In addition, rising margins was a positive.Nevertheless, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses, along with provisions, remain headwinds. U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other Major BanksDespite weak fixed income market revenues, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in the third quarter on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and elevated interest rates supported net interest income. In addition, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Though rise in rates provided some respite, lower revenues aided by fall in non-interest income were recorded. Moreover, expenses soared. Also, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Though the bank’s commercial portfolio improved, consumer loans disappointed. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2412,WFC,"Shares of the country’s biggest banks—including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday morning after the Senate finally passed its tax bill over the weekend.The reform package, which—among other things—slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, inspired the bulk of last week’s trading, including a noticeable rally in the aforementioned bank stocks. Now, these financial behemoths are moving even higher as investors become increasingly optimistic that some form of the bill will eventually become law.Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were all up more than 2% in morning trading Monday. Shares of JPMorgan also gained more than 2%, touching a new all-time high of $108.40 in the process. Elsewhere, investment behemoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was up over 1.5%, while smaller national banks like PNC (PNC  -  Free Report), Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), and Fifth Third (FITB  -  Free Report) were also in the green.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are components, moved more than 1.2% higher in early morning hours. The SPDR KBW Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained over 2.5%, and the Financial SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) surged about 2%.On top of the tax reform bill, investors seem excited about direction of the Federal Reserve. Last week, confirmation testimony from Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell all but confirmed another interest rate hike at the central bank’s next policy meeting.Trump’s pick to succeed Janet Yellen also hinted that he believes deregulation might be necessary in today’s banking industry (also read: 5 Bank Stocks to Buy on Jerome H. Powell Testimony).Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was in the red on Monday, supporting the thesis that investors may finally be cashing out of the red-hot sector. Tech has dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but as geopolitical tensions continue to rise, large funds may be shifting to the seemingly less-volatile financial world.Looking ahead, the banking rally will depend on the Fed’s monetary policy, so in addition to the rate cut, investors will want to pay attention to what the nation’s top economists say about 2018. If the tax bill passes, these bank giants could see an improvement to their bottom lines next year, but other factors could always have an influence.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2413,WFC,"S&P Global Ratings recently downgraded the ratings of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The Wall Street biggie’s long-term issuer credit rating has been downgraded to ‘A-’ from ‘A’ and short-term issuer credit rating from ‘A-1’ to ‘A-2’. The credit profile has also been changed to ‘a’ from ‘a+’.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been affirmed at “stable”.Rationale Behind the DowngradeFollowing the consent order by the Federal Reserve which puts a cap on increasing assets beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017) for Wells Fargo due to poor governance and controls, S&P also downgraded the bank’s ratings.Per the rating agency, the regulatory risk of Wells Fargo seems more than expected, and duration of operational and governance improvement also is likely to take longer time. It has been more than a year since the news of the banking giant’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Moreover, the Fed’s latest move has escalated reputational headwinds for the bank which might result in more customer attrition impacting financial performance and credit metrics.Rating Outlook AffirmationAffirmation of stable outlook depicts S&P’s expectations of improved compliance and operational risk management of the bank with meeting the provisions of the Fed consent order. Further, the rating agency anticipates the banking giant to receive independent third-parties’ review confirmation of its processes on improvement plan by Sep 30, 2018.Additionally, competitive position of the bank in core businesses are predicted to be minimally affected due to regulatory growth restrictions, and S&P expects the bank to maintain its earnings growth and stable asset quality over the next two years. Capital equity Tier 1 ratio is also anticipated to be above the company's long-term target of 10%, and the S&P’s risk-adjusted capital ratio is likely to remain at the higher end of the 7-10% range.Rating Action by Other FirmRecently, Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), affirmed all the ratings of Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries. The bank’s long-term deposit rating has been affirmed at A2, senior debt rating at Aa2 and subordinated debt rating at Aa3. The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is Aa1(cr)/Prime-1(cr). The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa1/Prime-1 and a stand-alone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been downgraded to “negative” from “stable”.ConclusionCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. Also, the recent assets cap put on the bank by the Fed has disappointed investors. Therefore, it is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s year-to-date performance reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.2%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 2.3%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderComerica (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

2414,WFC,"The Senate has finally passed the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018, ironing out difficulties in the path of President Trump’s historic tax reform plan. Trump believes that such an opportunity to benefit the middle class by slashing corporate tax rates comes once in a lifetime. Markets rallied after this development as investors believe that a tax cut will boost the U.S. economy over the long term.Tax Reforms to Boost GDPThe latest report from Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) reveals that the new tax plan will drive the economy to new heights. According to the report, a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% will lift the annual GDP growth rate to as high as 5%; the projected range lies between 3% and 5%.As per Business Insider, the U.S. GDP growth rate was 7.4% in 1984, after which it never touched 5%. In fact, since 1980, the rate crossed the 4.5% mark only thrice. It should be noted that with a lower corporate tax rate, companies will accumulate more disposable income to invest in the domestic market and thereby create more jobs. This will pave the way for further economic growth.Tech & Bank Bigwigs Set to GainAccording to Moody's, as much as $1.3 trillion in cash has been stored by U.S. firms overseas in order to avoid paying the stiff corporate tax rate. The five top cash hoarders in the country — Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. , Cisco Systems, Inc  and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report)  — have stockpiled 88% of their cash outside the country, notes CNNMoney. A cut in rates will encourage these companies to repatriate cash, boosting the U.S. economy substantially.Banks also bear a huge tax burden. Among all the sectors representing the S&P 1500 index, financials contribute 25% of tax liabilities, per KBW Research. The investment banking firm believes that the tax rate cut will help Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) boost their earnings by 20%.Per Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the consumer staples sector paid the second highest taxes in the S&P 500 index last year — at a rate of 29.1%. Thus, lower taxes will massively benefit consumer staples companies like Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever PLC (UN  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp.  (SYY  -  Free Report). Tyson Foods sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tax Plan Might Increase Debt BurdenThere has been a prolonged debate on whether the baby boomers generation will become a major burden for the Social Security system. Baby boomers are all those who were born between 1946 and 1964, accumulating almost 76 million people at present, according to media resources. Media reports also claim that this generation will make it to the list of full retirement benefits by 2031.Meanwhile, CNBC claims that Trump’s tax reform will lower revenues by $1.5 trillion in the next 10 years for the U.S. government. Investors should know that, according to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, out of $3.9 trillion spent in fiscal 2016, more than $3.3 trillion was funded by the government. Hence, only a nominal amount was borrowed.However, in the coming years, the government will need to borrow more to support Social Security. In other words, Trump’s tax plan to stimulate the domestic economy will increase the debt burden considerably, raising questions about its sustainability.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Its involvement in fake-account scandal has majorly led to this rating downgrade.The downward rating reflects Wells Fargo’s operational inefficiency and improper management. The rating agency also took into account the bank’s falling reputation because of the several legal issues that have come to light of late.Further, DBRS also considered the amount of expenses the bank has already incurred and would be facing in the near term.Wells Fargo has already agreed to pay $142 million in settlement of class-action suit for opening accounts without its customers’ permission. Also, it paid refunds of about $3.7 million to its customers through July 2017.However, this was not the end for Wells Fargo’s troubles. Some more disclosures regarding problems in other consumer-related products were made.The bank had been accused of charging high termination fees and unauthorized credit card fees along with issues in its auto insurance business in August 2017. Later, news of Wells Fargo closing authentic bank accounts without permission was reported. Moreover, as a result of an expanded review, the bank revealed that another 1.4 million fake accounts were created by its employees illegally. It has agreed to pay another $2.8 million as refunds to customers.The regulators are yet to take actions against the bank. Recently, the Fed Chair Janet Yellen called Wells Fargo’s actions ""egregious and unacceptable"" and disclosed that the Fed is trying to understand the main reasons for these problems.DBRS’ rating still keeps Wells Fargo among the highest-rated banks because of its diversified franchise and strong capital position. However, the rating agency disclosed that higher-than- expected litigation costs are leading to reduced profits. In fact, any further asset quality deterioration would lead to a negative rating.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 17.6% over the past year, underperforming the 36.4% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report) and M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report).

2416,WFC,"The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start reducing its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities after its two-day policy meeting ends on Sep 20. This will be for the first time ever that the central bank will unwind its crisis-era stimulus program. The bond selloff, in the meanwhile, is pushing the long-term Treasury yields higher. Such yields have also been climbing after U.S. consumer prices accelerated in August. This calls for investing in banks as such institutions will see increased profits with an uptick in Treasury yields.Explaining the Fed’s Balance Sheet CutThe Fed pulled the economy during the financial crisis by acquiring vast quantities of bonds and mortgage-backed securities. In this process, the Fed pumped in almost a whopping $4.5 trillion in government securities. This phenomenon is known as quantitative easing and was aimed at uplifting the economy by keeping long-term interest rates low. By holding down rates, the Fed made it easier for the U.S. government to finance budget deficits and for home buyers to apply for loans. It also reduced expenses for companies in China and other emerging economies that borrow in dollars.The Fed, however, put an end to its buying spree in 2014 but refrained from pairing its swollen balance sheet until the economy showed signs of improvement. Now, most policy makers are expecting the unwinding process to begin later this year.And why not? The U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment gave the economy a boost. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Additionally, the Empire State factory gauge hit 24.4 this month, while the new orders component of the report came in strong, as it reached its highest point since October 2009. The NFIB small business optimism index also remained healthy with a reading of 105.3.The Fed, in the meanwhile, is expected to take baby steps in the unwinding process. As per the current plan, the Fed’s balance sheet is expected to initially shrink by only $10 billion a month. Later, the pace of the unwinding process will increase to a maximum of $50 billion a month. Treasury Yields Rise, Fed to Stay on Track for December Rate HikeWith the Fed expected to sell off bonds at a gradual pace, Treasury yields moved north. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.239% on Sep 19, compared with 2.230% the day before, while the 30-year bond yield edged higher to 2.810%, versus 2.804% on Sep 18. Banking behemoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) said that “we expect the announcement next week of Fed balance-sheet normalization, to begin in October, will lift 10-year Treasury yields.”U.S. consumer prices, in the meantime, rose 0.4% in August, its biggest one-month gain since January. This has pushed the year-over-year increase to 1.9% from 1.7% in July. Inflationary pressure firmed in August and brought an end to five successive months of soft data. With inflation gradually climbing to the Fed’s target level, expectations of a further rate hike strengthened.According to the CME Group, there is a 58.3% chance that the Fed will raise borrowing costs at its December meeting, up from 38% a week earlier. As per the CNBC Fed Survey, about 76% respondents believe the central bank will hike interest rates in December. Policy makers also see two to three rate hikes next year and forecast the end of the Fed’s rate-hike cycle in 2019.Banks Ride the Wave of Steepening Yield CurveSince banks lend over the long term and borrow for shorter periods, an increase in the long-term yield is beneficial for them. This boosts net interest margin, an important profitability metric for the banking sector. The spread between long-term and short-term rates also expands during interest rate hikes because long-term rates tend to rise faster than short-term rates.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 cohort rose 0.8% on Sep 19, most in the index.  Shares of banking giants including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) scaled 0.7%, 1.2%, 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively. In the last one-year period, all of these companies had registered double-digit growth.Buy These 5 Bank Stocks Right AwayAs higher yields bode well for lenders, investing in sound bank stocks will be judicious. Optimism surrounding President Trump’s plans to slash taxes and relax regulations has already provided an impetus to bank stocks. Moreover, banks have cleared the Fed’s stress test with flying colors this year. They have adequate capital cushion, which can be used for paying out dividends and repurchasing stocks.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B.

2418,WFC,"The Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks will perform this time, after reporting impressive results in the first three quarters of 2017.The last year has been a roller coaster ride for banks. Though the year begun on an optimistic note with high expectations from President Trump’s electoral promises, it lost some steam in the middle only to regain the bullish trend at the end.Banks showed resilience driven by the Fed’s hawkish stance (three rate hikes in 2017) and the gradually improving U.S. economy. Also, progress on the lesser banking regulation front cheered investors.Further, the new tax act drove the banks too. While the act will result in gains for banks over the long term, the to-be-reported quarter earnings will be adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to the changes in the tax law.Additionally, factors that weighed on major banks’ prior-quarter results persisted in Q4 as well. These, including trading weakness, slowdown in mortgage banking and stable net interest margins, will likely hamper profitability of major banks. On top of these, the above-mentioned charges add fuel to the fire.Also, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings is expected to escalate costs moderately.As such, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness a 6.3% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Analysis article).Nevertheless, strength in investment banking driven by a potential rise in equity issuances (strong rally in the equity market globally) and persistent increase in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) is expected to provide respite to some extent.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a slight improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer will offer marginal support interest income for banks.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Choosing the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

2419,WFC,"A steadily growing economy, more confident consumers and record low jobless rate are sure to give banks a lift this Q4 earnings season. These favorable factors will encourage more people to take loans, and with rising interest rates, net interest margins will improve. Reduction in corporate taxes will also boost earnings as banks will be able to retain more of their revenues.But, the Trump administration’s overhaul of the tax law means that banks will have to re-measure the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and consider one-time charges for repatriating overseas earnings. Most of the banking behemoths have already announced such one-time charges associated with the accounting changes that will now have to be made.Nevertheless, let us focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season. Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Loans to GrowThe consumer confidence index is at a historically high level, courtesy of a bullish job market. While the unemployment rate remained at a record low of 4.1%, workers’ pay has increased 2.5% in the December 2016 to December 2017 period, up from 2.4% in the prior month.The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that the minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will reach employee wages closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”All these factors will lend consumers the flexibility to take more debt and also reduce loan default risks, which bode well for banks.Rising Rates for Borrowers, Not SaversAs widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month. The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. In fact, Fed officials expect to hike rates at a steady pace. The median expectation for rate hikes this year is pegged at three — at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020.A move toward higher rates is a welcome news for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. Then again, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.With the Fed hiking rates by a quarter-point, the biggest banks by assets also said that they will do the same to its main lending rate. Millions of credit card holders and small-business borrowers will have to pay more in terms of interest. But, does that mean there will be higher rates in deposits? Certainly not! Rates for savers will remain unchanged, confirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). Thus, the ability to earn more on assets and limit the cost of liabilities to depositors should keep shareholders of U.S. banks cheerful.How Will Banks Deal With Tax Reform?House Republicans passed a monumental bill to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, making it the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates ever.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to around 20%.But, such tax cuts will result in revaluation in deferred tax assets. This in turn will result in one-off hits to banks’ profits. However, even though it may hamper Q4 earnings, shareholders will be much better off over the long term.5 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q4Barring one-time accounting charges, improving consumer sentiment and rise in interest rates will help banks stay afloat this Q4 earnings season. This calls for investing in five banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q4 earnings.These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP — our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

2420,WFC,"As anticipated by the markets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) announced a rise in its quarterly dividend, as part of its 2017 capital plan. The company declared a revised quarterly cash dividend of 56 cents per share, up 12% from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Oct 31 to shareholders on record as of Oct 6. Based on the Sep 19 closing price of $93.94 per share, the dividend yield is 2.38%.Since 2011, JPMorgan has been raising its dividend annually. From paying 5 cents a share as quarterly dividend during the financial crisis, the company has come a long way in displaying its capital strength. Prior to this hike, the company had raised its dividend by 4.16% (from 48 cents to 50 cents per share) in March 2016.JPMorgan’s 2017 capital plan also includes a $19.4-billion share repurchase authorization, through third-quarter 2018. Supported by a solid balance sheet position, the company continues to enhance its shareholders’ value through efficient capital deployment activities.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are among the other major banks that got approval from the Federal Reserve for their 2017 capital plans. These include share repurchase programs and dividend hikes.Is Dividend Appeal Enough to Boost JPMorgan Stock?Though the overall banking sector’s prospects appear promising, can this dividend hike help JPMorgan draw investors’ attention?Stock is Undervalued: JPMorgan’s stock looks undervalued based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. The company currently has a P/E ratio of 13.42 and a trailing 12-month P/S of 2.94, which is below the industry average of 14.37 and 3.00, respectively.Earnings per Share Growth: JPMorgan’s earnings are projected to increase nearly 10.3% in 2017 and more than 12.9% in 2018. Also, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 14.6%, in the trailing four quarters.Share Price Movement: JPMorgan’s shares gained 40.6% over the past 12 months compared with 34.3% growth recorded by the industry.However, you must consider the following downsides before taking the plunge.  Leverage: JPMorgan’s debt/equity ratio of 1.39 compares with the industry average of 0.88, indicating a higher debt level relative to the industry.Return on Equity (ROE): JPMorgan’s trailing 12-month ROE of 11.53% gradually deteriorated over last few years. Also, it compares unfavorably with ROE of 15.86% for the S&P 500, reflecting the fact that it is less efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Revenue Growth: Though revenues witnessed a CAGR of 1.2%, over the last three years (2014-2016), projected sales growth of 6.13% does not compare favorably with the industry average of 6.22%.Non-Interest Income: JPMorgan’s non-interest income has seen a precipitous decline at a CAGR (2013-2016) of 2.8%. Though it increased in the first six months of 2017, volatility in equity markets is expected to put pressure on fee income.Our TakeJust because JPMorgan has announced a dividend hike, we don’t think the stock is worth adding to your portfolio. Projected revenue growth and decline in non-interest income along with a high-debt level raise our apprehensions about the stock’s performance. Currently it carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2421,WFC,"President Trump’s plans of massive tax cuts and reforms cleared a critical hurdle with the Senate passing a budget blueprint of trillions of dollars for fiscal 2018. This has paved the way for the Republicans to pursue the much awaited tax-cut reform without Democratic support. After all, both American households and corporates have borne the burden of an unfair tax code for quite some time.The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates will put more money in individual’s pockets, while it will be a shot in the arm for financial as well as tech majors that have parked a lot of cash overseas. The cash held overseas will be brought back to avail the lower domestic rate, prompting a slew of new deals. This in turn will fuel innovation, organic growth and earnings.Repatriation of billions of dollars also strengthens the economy causing the federal funds rate to move north, which bodes well for both banking and non-banking financial organizations. Thus, let us invest in multinational financial and information technology service providers, as well as computer makers that can make the most from the lowering of corporate tax rate.Senate Republicans Push Through Budget ProposalSenate Republicans successfully passed a $4-trillion budget blueprint in federal outlays by a 51-to-49 vote. The Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget measure, with GOP senator Rand Paul of Kentucky voting against it. This has set the stage for Republicans to begin ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code as early as this year, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses globally more competitive.After repeatedly failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, the GOP lawmakers were under tremendous pressure to deliver on tax reforms that they had promised in the election campaign. The Senate’s passage of the budget blueprint has unlocked a special parliamentary procedure that will help Republicans cut $1.5 trillion in taxes with just 50 votes. A typical Senate procedure requires 60 votes to bypass the threat of a filibuster.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell supported the budget and said that it was “critical to getting tax reform done;” while President Trump added that it is “an important step in advancing the Administration’s pro-growth and pro-jobs legislative agenda.”President Trump, in the meantime, had a tough message for House Republicans. They need to work on the tax reform and pass the Senate’s budget this week or face bloodbath next year. House Speaker Paul Ryan had already told his members that he wants tax reform enacted by this year, and approving the revised Senate budget this week gives the best shot to get it done within that timeframe.Banks Set to Gain From Trump’s Sweeping Tax CutsIt’s no wonder that bank’s profitability will be enhanced by the proposed tax cuts. The corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%.The slashing of domestic tax rate will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This will, ultimately, boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Non-banking financial institutions including insurance companies, asset managers and brokerage firms should also benefit. Rising rates act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should gain from a higher rate environment.Brokerage firms and asset managers also advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions From Trump’s Tax Plan Tax cuts will make tech majors bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will encourage such companies to carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Oracle Corporation hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings.

2422,WFC,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been in the news on a regular basis, following the sales scam that surfaced in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in the bank’s auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.To add to the woes, during the first quarter, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). The Fed’s action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees.Notably, the firm is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve. However, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.Mortgage business, the primary source of revenue for Wells Fargo, is expected to witness a slowdown in the first quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues is expected to be low.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q1 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto-lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, management expects loan growth to be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. Additionally, based on the current pricing trends and channel mix in held-for-sale pipeline, the gain on sale margin is expected to decline.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Moreover, high legal costs might be witnessed due to ongoing litigation hassles.Non-Interest Revenues to Grow Modestly: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely be recorded on market declines. However, driven by high volatility, trading activity is expected to improve marginally in the quarter and rise in trust income is anticipated on higher equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.73%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings remained stable over the last seven days and is expected to be up 7% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $21.7 billion, down 1.5% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 18.

2423,WFC,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) — all reporting financial numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, interest-rate hikes, tax act movements and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of positive catalysts, have been on the downside.Notably, the U.S. corporate tax overhaul is expected to hurt earnings in the fourth quarter on one-time charge related to cash repatriation and write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs).Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth might be offset by rising consumer loans. Therefore, interest income for banks is likely to improve marginally.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the quarter.Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the banks’ top lines. As the interest-rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. Therefore, debt origination fees will lead to solid gains.Also, despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 turned triumphant. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for banks.On the cost front, banks might record marginally higher expense level due to digitization. Further, the recent tax reform is likely to result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in fourth-quarter 2017 are projected to rise 2.8% year over year.Nonetheless, there might be a surprise in store for major banking stocks this earnings season. Let’s take a look at the three major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow.JPMorgan will report the fourth-quarter earnings before the opening bell. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00%, we are unable to conclusively predict an earnings beat in the quarter to be reported. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Steady rise in net interest income and slowdown in mortgage banking due to seasonality is expected. Investment banking income is projected to be up in the high-single-digits range for the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, weak trading activities and the company’s expectation of one-time charge related to cash repatriation to be more than $2 billion due to the U.S. corporate tax overhaul is likely to be major drag. (Read more: Can JPMorgan's Q4 Earnings Brave Trading Slump?).Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:J P Morgan Chase & Co Price and EPS Surprise J P Morgan Chase & Co Price and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteOn Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo, is also slated to announce results. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.76%, the chances of a likely earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter are bright. Wells Fargo is likely to benefit from easing margin and high interest income, though marginally. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth might be offset by rising consumer loans. Nonetheless, mounting expenses, continual auto loan portfolio runoff and low mortgage business due to seasonality are expected to dent the banking giant’s results. Furthermore, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the quarter. (Read more: Can Wells Fargo Q4 Earnings Hide Mortgage Weakness?).Wells Fargo posted an average beat of 2.75% for the preceding four quarters, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of them, as demonstrated in the chart below: Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteLikewise PNC Financial is also likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter, with an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Expected higher net-interest income and consumer loan growth are anticipated to support earnings. Management projects its net interest income for the quarter under review to increase in low-single digits on a sequential basis. Moreover, an increase in fee income is estimated on investment banking and underwriting business strength. However, one-time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform might be on the downside.

2424,WFC,"Driven by top-line strength, Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV  -  Free Report) recorded a positive earnings surprise of 1.6% in third-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, the reported figure came in 25% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Higher revenues backed by strong loans & deposits balances drove organic growth. Notably, lower efficiency ratio was a tailwind. Moreover, positive impact of rising rates was witnessed.However, escalating expenses and provisions remain a concern for investors which led a 1.7% fall in share price post third-quarter results.  Including the Cabela’s transaction fee and other non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $95.4 million or 78 cents per share compared with $62.7 million or 51 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Top-Line Strength Reflected, Expenses Flare UpTotal adjusted revenues in the third quarter were $331.3 million, up 12.4% year over year. In addition, the top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Net interest income increased 16.2% year over year to $262.6 million. Further, net interest margin expanded 36 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.63%.Non-interest income increased significantly on a year-over-year basis to $135.4 million, including Cabela’s transaction fee and higher brokerage revenues, partially offset by investment securities losses and lower mortgage banking income. Adjusted non-interest income was $68.4 million, almost stable year over year.On the other hand, total non-interest expenses were $205.6 million, up 10.6% year over year, while adjusted non-interest expenses came in at $194.1 million, up 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, increase in almost all components of expenses led to the rise, partially offset by lower advertising expenses.Adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.59%, as compared with 62.41% in the year-earlier quarter. A decline in ratio indicates improvement in profitability.Total deposits came in at $26.2 billion, up 8.3% year over year. Total net loans climbed 5.2% year over year to $24.2 billion.Credit Quality: A Concern?Credit quality metrics for Synovus was a mixed bag in the quarter.Net charge-offs climbed 22.1% year over year to $38.1 million. The annualized net charge-off ratio was 0.62%, up 50 bps from the year-earlier quarter. Provision for loan losses jumped significantly year over year to $39.7 million.Non-performing loans were up 34% year over year to $97.8 million.

The non-performing asset ratio contracted 20 bps year over year to 0.57%.Capital Position: A Mixed BagTier 1 capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 10.41% and 12.28%, respectively, compared with 10.05% and 12.04% as of Sep 30, 2016.Also, as of Sep 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio (fully phased-in) was 9.87% compared with 9.48% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 Leverage ratio was 9.34% compared with 8.98% in the comparable period last year.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased common stock worth $90.6 million.Our TakeSynovus’ results have been quite decent in the quarter. We believe the company’s focus on both organic and inorganic growth, together with cost containment efforts, will pay off and aid bottom-line expansion in subsequent years. Though escalating expenses and provisions raise concerns, lower efficiency ratio indicates optimism.Synovus Financial Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Synovus Financial Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Synovus Financial Corp. QuoteCurrently, Synovus carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other BanksDespite weak fixed income market revenues, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in the third quarter on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and elevated interest rates supported net interest income. In addition, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Though rise in rates provided some respite, lower revenues aided by fall in non-interest income were recorded. Moreover, expenses soared. Also, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Though the bank’s commercial portfolio improved, consumer loans disappointed. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2426,WFC,"The expected fall in JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenues will likely have an adverse impact on fourth-quarter 2017 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Nevertheless, this may not lead the company to report bleak results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are expected to offset the trading slump.Also, though market volatility has not improved much in the last quarter, the decrease in trading revenues will primarily be attributable to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed significantly higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.At an investor conference in early December 2017, Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down roughly 15% year over year. Lake further said “there haven’t been that many catalysts” and volatility remains ""low across the spectrum.""Similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be primarily responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $2.86 billion reflects a decline of 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.57 billion indicates a marginal rise from the last-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence JPMorgan’s Q4 results:Continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances.As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this will lead to strong gains.Also, despite being seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for JPMorgan.The company projects investment banking income to be up in high-single-digits range for the fourth quarter.Steady rise in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in improvement in interest income.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Seasonality is also expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues. Moreover, JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. Mortgage banking revenues are expected to be down 7.3% year over year to $1.57 billion.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact JPMorgan’s earnings unusually.Impact of new tax code: In early December 2017 (before the passage of the tax act), JPMorgan executive had noted that the U.S. corporate tax overhaul will hurt earnings in the fourth quarter. The company had expected one-time charge related to cash repatriation to be more than $2 billion.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:JPMorgan does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.05%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

2427,WFC,"The projected decline in Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) mortgage business will likely impact its fourth-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. However, this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 12. Benefits of higher rates and loan growth are anticipated to be positive factors.Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues are expected to be low resulting from seasonality that might be eased due to immaterial negative MSR valuation adjustments. Notably, expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Here are the other factors influencing Q4 results:Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter. Particularly, weakness in commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth will likely be offset by rising consumer loans. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income. Notably, management projects NII to grow in low- to mid-single digits for 2017.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be around 61% in 2017, excluding the $1-billion discrete litigation accrual recorded in third-quarter 2017 and any other non-recurring expenses. Further, the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by 2019. Of the total cost savings target, 21% is expected to be achieved in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not providing any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.76%.

2428,WFC,"U.S. equity markets are going through turbulent times. There is a lot of volatility and uncertainty owing to rising geopolitical risks and political uncertainty. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. North Korea conducted its seventh nuclear test, an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile that flew over Japan, on Sep 14, 2017. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created huge unrest in a number of Asian economies and the United States.In response to continuous missile tests, President Donald Trump in his maiden UN General Assembly speech threatened to completely destroy North Korea. This prompted North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to warn the United States of the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history”.Moreover, North Korea’s foreign minister stated that Trump’s comments indicate that the United States has declared war against North Korea. ""Since the U.S. declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down the U.S. bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country,"" foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said. However, the White House has rejected the accusations.This latest development made investors flock to safe haven investments and led to a decline in tech stocks (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain Amid Latest North Korea Threats).Trump’s ActionsThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, there are renewed doubts over the capabilities of the Trump administration.Trump introduced a new travel ban with restrictions on citizens from eight nations, six of which are Muslim majority. Starting Oct 18, citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Somalia, and North Korea will be banned from traveling to the United States. However, people holding permanent residency or visas are exempted from the ban, but cannot renew their visas once they expire.Moreover, the Trump administration is being highly criticized. In a separate development, six advisers to Trump have been found to be using personal email addresses for official government purposes. This is ironical given Trump’s stance on the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal server prior to the 2016 Presidential elections (read: Trump Widens North Korea Sanctions: ETFs in Focus).In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

2429,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was bullish. The Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance in its just-concluded September meeting was the primary reason for increased investors’ optimism for banks.While the downsizing of balance sheet was expected, what surprised the market was the Fed signaling four more rate hikes over the next 12 months. With banks being one of the main beneficiaries of the interest rate hikes, the stocks moved higher and 10-year Treasury bond yields rose.Moving on to bank specific news, over the last five trading sessions, three major banks announced dividend hikes (as part of their 2017 capital plan). Further, their efforts to move toward digitization to improve efficiency continued.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Sep 15, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. As part of their approved 2017 capital plan, three banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) — announced dividend hikes. JPMorgan declared a revised quarterly cash dividend of 56 cents per share, up 12% from the prior payout.

Bill.com’s technology is likely to be integrated into JPMorgan’s digital system by early 2018. (Read more: JPMorgan Partners With Bill.com to Eradicate Paper Payments).3. It seems that fake account opening scandal will continue to haunt Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) for some more time. DBRS, a Toronto-based credit rating agency, has lowered the company’s ratings to AA (low) from AA. The downward rating reflects Wells Fargo’s operational inefficiency and improper management. The rating agency also took into account the bank’s falling reputation because of the several legal issues that have come to light of late.

2430,WFC,"Key bank earnings are scheduled for release this Friday. The figures are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s prospects in the near future. Banking stocks are expected to gain from recently concluded tax cuts, but not without suffering a short cycle of discomfort. Most of these have already issued a warning about a likely difficult fourth quarter owing to accounting adjustments necessary to adapt to the new tax structure.For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) has already warned that its fourth-quarter results could be impacted by almost $2 billion due to the new tax law. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has remained silent on this issue. In this context, key bank earnings scheduled for release over this week and the next, including BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), assume greater significance. With JPMorgan and Wells Fargo scheduled to report on Jan 12, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock now. Both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Return on Assets (ROA)Examining earnings per share alone would not generate any significant insights when determining the level of profitability of a bank. Return on assets is a ratio which reveals how efficiently a bank is utilizing its assets to generate profits. Currently, JPMorgan holds total assets of $376.5 billion while Wells Fargo has total assets of $305.7 billion. Our research shows that the average one-year trailing 12-month ROA for Wells Fargo is at 1.16%, higher than 1.06% for JPMorgan.Price PerformanceJPMorgan has gained 11.7% over the last three months, outperforming the broader industry which has gained 8.9% over the same period. In comparison, Wells Fargo has not only outperformed the broader industry but is only fractionally behind JPMorgan, gaining 11.6% over the same time frame. ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.79. This is below the S&P 500 average of 3.87. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry. Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.62 JPMorgan is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Wells Fargo is also undervalued compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 1.69, it is marginally pricier than JPMorgan.   Dividend YieldWells Fargo’s dividend yield over a year is 2.52%. With a dividend yield of 2.07%, JPMorgan shareholders fetch a somewhat lower dividend yield than Wells Fargo. Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, JPMorgan has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 12.8%. Wells Fargo has matched this feat, but with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.8%, it loses this round to its larger rival. But the situation changes when considering Earnings ESP values, with JPMorgan clocking in at -0.62% while Wells Fargo’s reading stands at +0.76%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that JPMorgan holds an edge over Wells Fargo when considering a more detailed earnings history. Both stocks are neck to neck when considering price performance and valuation. However, Wells Fargo is superior when considering return on assets and dividend yield.Additionally, it carries a positive ESP reading unlike JPMorgan. Both stocks have a the same Zacks Rank and seem to be evenly matched but Wells Fargo is preferable ahead of earnings, since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2431,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was overtly positive. The bullish trend was largely driven by progress in tax reform bill, favorable economic data and positive comments by Jerome H. Powell — President Trump's nominee for Fed Chairman.Powell’s comments in support of lesser regulations cheered investors. Apart from this, stability in the Fed's policy despite leadership change is a good sign for the banking sector. Also, encouraging economic data (surge in consumer confidence and higher-than-expected GDP rate) point toward an improving economy.All these favorable factors drove banking stocks higher. Further, banks continued with their initiatives to improve operating efficiency and strengthen profitability through restructuring businesses.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Nov 10, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

2432,WFC,"Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is among the best post-financial crisis success stories. The company’s financial performance has witnessed a significant turnaround over the last couple of years. This, in turn, has aided the stock’s rally.If we look at 2016, BofA’s performance was one of the best. This was driven by several favorable macroeconomic factors like rising interest rates, improving economy and a rise in client activity.Success of BofA’s cost control initiatives, steady rise in loans and deposits, higher trading revenues and steadily improving asset quality supported its performance last year. Moreover, election of Donald Trump as President acted as a catalyst. However, slump in energy sector marginally hurt the company’s performance. But this was more than offset by positive factors.In 2016, the company’s shares rallied 29.1%, thus being the best performer compared with JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Similarly, this year, BofA’s fundamental strength has continued to aid its profitability amid a slightly challenging operating backdrop as trading and mortgage banking activities slowed down. Nonetheless, easing margin pressure, given the two rate hikes announced this year and stable oil prices drove its financials. Further, the company has been steadily lowering its long-term debt.Additionally, BofA along with others cleared the annual stress test. Notably, the company’s 2017 capital plan of a whopping 60% dividend hike and $12 billion share repurchase authorization was among the biggest. This reflected its strong balance sheet position and cheered investors.After initial hiccups, electoral promises by President Trump including easing of regulatory burden for banks and tax reforms seem to be moving forward. Further, encouraging economic data and stability in the Fed’s policy despite change in leadership continue to drive the stock up.So far this year, the company’s shares have jumped 27.5%. This is the best among big banks, with Citigroup coming the close second at 27%.Nonetheless, chances of Citigroup surpassing BofA’s price performance this year are less. Citigroup continues to face margin pressure owing to persistent decline in its legacy holdings portfolio despite rise in rates. This remains a big concern and investors seem to be wary.Therefore, BofA is likely to retain its top spot. With high chance of another rate later this month, investors seem to be bullish on the stock. Also, with improvement in economy, demand for loans will continue to rise.Further, BofA seems undervalued when compared with the broader industry as its current price/book and price/sales ratios are lower than the respective industry averages. Therefore, given the strong fundamentals, the stock has upside potential.Currently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2433,WFC,"Shares of the country’s largest banks—including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report)—gained on Wednesday, helping lift indexes that were otherwise battered by an industry-wide slump in tech stocks.Banks are starting to pick up momentum on the back of two key forces in Washington D.C. First, the entire financial sector—which witnessed huge gains after the election of Donald Trump’s surprise election victory last year—has surged as Republicans continue to make progress on their tax reform bill.After a luncheon with President Trump on Tuesday helped convince two previously on-the-fence budget committee members to approve the bill, GOP leaders now expect the reform package to see a final vote on the Senate floor as soon as later this week.The bill would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which should help the bottom lines of large businesses like the aforementioned banking behemoths.Maybe more importantly, investors were pleased with the testimony of Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell this week.Powell—President Trump’s pick to succeed Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve—all but confirmed that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in December. The nominee also suggested that deregulation might be necessary in today’s banking industry (also read: 5 Bank Stocks to Buy on Jerome H. Powell Testimony).Finally, rising yields and Brexit related news could be playing into today’s banking rally. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was up more than 2.3% on Wednesday, alleviating some worry about a weaker economic outlook and lifting financials that hold credit balances. Meanwhile, the U.K. and E.U. appear close to agreeing to a Brexit deal, which could ease concerns about U.S. banks with large footholds in London.Shares of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup were all up slightly more than 2% in early afternoon trading hours Wednesday. JPMorgan’s gains helped lift the Dow into the green, while the entire banking rally protected the S&P 500 index from the tech selloff.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down nearly 1.3%, providing evidence to the theory that investors may finally be cashing out of the red-hot sector. Tech has dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but after a relatively strong Q3 earnings season for the industry giants, it could very well be profit taking time.It is also worth noting that large funds are beginning their rebalancing process as we approach the end of the month, so we could be seeing the effects of some serious money moving around. What’s more, several geopolitical sagas—most notably the North Korean regime’s latest missile test—could be inspiring investors to move to more “tried-and-true” sectors.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2434,WFC,"President Trump’s Federal Reserve chairman pick, Jerome H. Powell confirmed that certain bank regulations need to be rolled back. Easing of banking regulations will give more power to banking authorities and spur lending activities.Powell also hinted that the chances of a rate hike next month are growing. This development also helped banks’ shares move north as it will drive profits for such companies. Hence, investing in sound bank stocks seems judicious.Powell Favors Relaxed Bank RegulationsPowell, in his Senate confirmation hearing on Nov 29, said that the Dodd-Frank Act strengthened the financial system. Such an Act was passed during the 2008 financial crisis. But, he believes that certain areas of the Act should be eased, such as regulations pertaining to banks. These regulations were baseless and had limited banks’ operational flexibility for a considerable period of time.Banks, moreover, will be in a position to maintain higher levels of capital reserves in exchange of less stringent regulations. With more capital in the economy, lending will increase, which bodes well for banks. In fact, Powell’s comments encouraged several GOP senators, who have argued that for years Dodd-Frank impeded economic growth by making bank loan procurements tougher.Case for Rate Hike in December ‘Coming Together’ — PowellPowell, who has served as Fed governor since 2012, added that the case for a December rate hike has strengthened on an upbeat labor market. While payroll gains averaged a healthy 162,000 over the past three months, jobless rate fell to 4.1% in October as labor conditions returned to normal following the hurricane-weakened September.Currently, the benchmark lending rate is in a range of 1% to 1.25%. A December rate hike will result in the third rate hike this year and the fifth tightening of policy since mid-2009. Wall Street is currently pricing an almost 92.8% chance of a rate hike by the end of the year, per CME Group data.Hike in interest rates, in turn, boosts bank profits. It increases the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. The spread between long-term and short-term rates also expands during interest rate hikes because long-term rates tend to rise faster than short-term rates.Bank Stocks Gain TractionAs loosening up of regulations and higher rates bode well for lenders, banks stocks scaled north. Lest we forget, Trump’s initiative for a big tax cut overcame a potential obstacle. A Senate panel recently approved such measure despite the voicing of concerns by a handful of Republican members. Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them gain substantially when tax rates go down.As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will see a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut  to 20%. Thus, shares of such banking giants gained around 3%. In the last one-year period, all of these companies registered double-digit growth.5 Solid BuysGiven such positive trends, investing in fundamentally-sound banking stocks seems prudent.  We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).First Financial Bancorp (FFBC  -  Free Report) — a Zacks Rank #2 company —  operates as the bank holding company for First Financial Bank that provides commercial banking and other banking, and banking-related services to individuals and businesses in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.

2435,WFC,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 13, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1. Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share. Though rise in rates provided some respite, lower revenues aided by a fall in non-interest income were recorded. In addition, expenses soared.Further, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Though the bank’s commercial portfolio improved, consumer loans disappointed. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced. (Read more: Wells Fargo Q3 Earnings in Line, Legal Costs Flare Up)2. Despite trading slowdown, loan growth and higher interest rates drove Bank of America Corp’s (BAC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The figure was 17% higher than the prior-year quarter. Impressive net interest income growth, marginal increase in equity trading income and a slight rise in investment banking fees supported revenues. Operating expenses also recorded a decline. Further, credit costs decreased despite rise in loans. (Read more: BofA Keeps the Trend Alive, Beats on Q3 Earnings)3. U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 88 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2436,WFC,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q3 earnings releases. The going is good so far, with most big banks crushing estimates on both lines (read: Fed to Hike in December? Buy Quality ETFs).The backdrop should favor the banks along with the course of oil, the stance of the Fed and proposed policies of Trump. However, subdued inflation which may cause the Fed to act dovish and geopolitical risks are concerns for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at banking earnings in detail (read: Should You Buy Bank ETFs Before Earnings Release?):Big Bank Earnings in FocusJP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) reported earnings of $1.76 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 in the third quarter of 2017.

Further, the bottom line witnessed 3% year-over-year improvement. Though the investment bank remains under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter, a continued momentum in investment banking business benefited the bottom-line numbers. Goldman’s net revenues climbed 2% year over year to $8.3 billion in the quarter under review. Furthermore, revenues handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion.Impressive performance of wealth management division and higher investment banking fees drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 93 cents per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents.

2437,WFC,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results recorded 2.6% bottom-line improvement from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected an increase in revenues and higher expenses. The quarter witnessed a decrease in loans and leases and deposits. Additionally, provision for credit losses decreased, which was a tailwind.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $597 million or 74 cents per share compared with $599 million or 73 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Elevate, Loans & Deposits Fall, Costs Flare UpTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.85 billion, up 1.4% year over year. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 2.4% from the prior-year quarter to $1.69 billion. Also, net interest margin expanded 9 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.48%.Non-interest income inched up nearly 1% year over year to $1.17 billion. Rise in service charges on deposits, bankcard fees and merchant discounts, operating lease income and other income led to the growth. These increases were mostly offset by lower mortgage banking income and income from bank-owned life insurance. Also, the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income.Non-interest expense of $1.75 billion increased 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a rise in personnel expense, net merger-related and restructuring charges and other expense.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.3%, down from 58.7% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Sep 30, 2017, total deposits were nearly $156.1 billion, down from $159.9 billion in the prior-year quarter. However, total loans and leases were $144 billion, down around 1% year over year.Credit Quality ImprovedAs of Sep 30, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $680 million, down 19.3% year over year. As a percentage of total assets, NPAs came in at 0.31%, down 7 bps year over year. Also, during the quarter, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.04% of total loans and leases held for investment, contracting 2 bps year over year.Furthermore, net charge-offs were 0.35% of average loans and leases, down 2 bps year over year. Provision for credit losses was $126 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 14.9% decrease year over year.Strong Profitability & Capital RatiosAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.16%, up from 1.15% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity decreased to 8.82% from 8.87% as of Sep 30, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.8%, in line with the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was approximately 10.1% as of Sep 30, 2017, in line with the year-ago quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $920 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeWe anticipate BB&T to remain well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Moreover, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, will likely propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead.However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern. BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and elevated interest rates supported net interest income. In addition, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2438,WFC,"Continuing with its streamlining of insurance products, the U.S. banking and financial services firm Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is set to exit the Personal Insurance business. Following the strategic analysis of its business which began in October 2017, the Wall Street biggie decided to exit the business.Details of the ExitTo start with the winding down process, Wells Fargo will instantly stop marketing and product promotion-related activities. Notably, the bank expects to complete the exit process by first-quarter 2018. However, till then, Wells Fargo will continue to provide Personal Insurance products and serve customer policies.“Wells Fargo continually reviews our product and service offerings to ensure they meet our customers’ needs and align with the company’s long-term strategic goals,” said Laurie Nordquist, head of Personal Insurance. “The decision to exit the Personal Insurance business reflects these practices, and we will wind down operations in a measured and responsible way for our existing customers,” added Nordquist.A number of auto, homeowners, renters and umbrella personal insurance products have been provided by Wells Fargo, since 2003. Notably, among insurance brokerage agency in the company’s portfolio, Personal Insurance business is the last to exit. However, the contribution of this business was immaterial to the bank’s financials. Therefore, the winding down will not affect Wells Fargo’s Wealth and Investment Management’s life insurance practice.Similar ActionsPreviously, in December 2015, Wells Fargo vended its crop insurance business. Rural Community Insurance Services (RCIS) and its subsidiary Rural Community Insurance Company (RCIC) was sold to Zurich American Insurance Company (ZAIC) — a subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group. The deal was completed in 2016.Further, in June 2017, Wells Fargo signed a deal with USI Insurance Services to divest Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA, Inc (“WFIS”). The transaction is expected to close by the end of fourth-quarter 2017. The company offloaded its commercial insurance business with a view to regain focus on banking activities. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo’s personal insurance business will continue to operate under the consumer lending segment.Early this November, Wells Fargo Insurance, Inc. announced a purchase agreement with the global insurance brokerage — Hub International Limited — for vending its crop insurance broker business.ConclusionIt has been more than a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by regulators, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring. A number of consumer businesses have been affected, including some insurance products. Moreover, the bank was banned from conducting its municipal business in a number of states.Currently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for the bank till it gets all the dust settled. However, the company has been taking several initiatives to revamp its financial position. In May 2017, it doubled its cost-cutting targets to combat escalating expenses and improve financials. These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The bank’s performance, so far this year, reflects investors’ disappointment.

2441,WFC,"As expected, the Fed kept the short-term interest rates steady at 1-1.25% in its two-day FOMC meeting concluded yesterday and laid out the timing of reverse quantitative easing (QE), starting next month.The central bank will start unwinding its $4.5-trillion balance sheet, which is mostly composed of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it acquired under a program known as QE till 2014 since recession. So long, it has reinvested the entire proceeds it got from bonds. Now, the Fed will use a cap system every month to execute its roll off plans and reinvest the rest.The central bank has set a roll off target of $10 billion ($6 billion in Treasuries and $4 billion in mortgage-backed securities) per month that will increase every quarter until it reaches $50 billion ($30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for mortgage-backed securities) a month. The process is likely to continue until the balance sheet reaches about $2-$2.5 trillion.The Fed also hinted at one more rate hike this year and expects three lift-offs in 2018. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, the odds for a rate hike by December increased substantially to 67% from 58% a day ago (read: Should You Buy Bank ETFs Ahead of the Fed Meeting?).The move gave a bit more hawkish-than-expected signal, pushing Treasury yields higher, and in turn benefiting the financial sector. The sector is a major beneficiary of a rising-interest-rates environment. This is because the steepening yield curve would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers.Further, the upside to the finance sector is confirmed by the Zacks Sector Rank in the top 50% with more than 70% of the industries placed in the top 38%. This suggests continued outperformance for the sector for the coming months. That said, Zacks Financial Leasing Companies topped the list followed by Zacks Foreign Banks and Zacks Life Insurance.Accordingly, we have highlighted four ETFs and stocks that are expected to see smooth trading for the rest for the year and lead the market higher.Top ETFsWhile there are a number of ETFs in this corner of the market, we have highlighted those that have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) and offer broad exposure to the sector.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This is by far the most-popular financial ETF in the space with AUM of $25.6 billion and average daily volume of nearly 68.2 million shares.

2442,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) CEO Tim Sloan announced plans to regain trust the bank has lost due to its involvement in several malpractices lately, at the global conference held by Barclays (BCS  -  Free Report) last Tuesday. Also, he disclosed that the bank is planning to achieve an additional $2 billion reduction in expenses by the end of 2019.The bank is in the process of achieving its previous savings goal of $2 billion by year-end 2018. It seeks to achieve the target majorly by streamlining human resource, marketing, technology and operations departments. Further, it aims to close about 450 branches by 2018.For 2017, the bank expects third party expenses, including those related to sales practices, to remain high in the third quarter, while decline in fourth quarter. Also, efficiency ratio is expected to be below last three-quarter level.Regarding lending activities, Sloan said the bank is expected to witness continued decline in auto loans along with run off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio. Further, the lending is to be impacted by a slow and increasingly competitive commercial and commercial real estate lending environment. The decline in loans is to be partially offset by growth in non-conforming residential first mortgage.The revelation of fake account scandal that marked the starting point for the several problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Tim Sloan reiterated several structural and strategic remedial measures undertaken by the bank. Elimination of sales goals, a layer of management and introduction of training for retail bank managers on acceptable sales practices were some of the steps taken.We expect Wells Fargo’s focus on managing its business and efforts to remediate the wrong doings in the past to uplift its reputation. Also, its expense saving initiatives are likely to support its financials.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 6.4% year to date, versus the industry’s rally of 4.1%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

2443,WFC,"Hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, are expected to make U.S. banks suffer billions of dollars in losses, per a report published by The Street.Since borrowers in the affected areas are being unable to repay their loans, banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and a few others are dreading huge loan losses that they might have to face.According to analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), nearly $156 billion of loans of eight banks are expected to be affected in the coming 12 months. Hurricane Harvey is likely to cause loan losses of around $600 million to $1.1 billion, while losses from Irma could range from $1.2-$1.9 billion.Per the estimates of the analysts, the earnings per share (EPS) of banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) will likely drop by 1-2%.EPS losses for Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) are expected to range between 11-19%, while SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) are likely to see 6-10% drop in their EPS.In fact, according to Bank of America, Harvey is likely to end up being the costliest natural calamity to date, which can lead to overall losses of as much as $108 billion for the entire economy.Notably, global economist, Ethan Harris, wrote in a note that the hurricane is expected to impact economic growth for the third quarter, dragging it down by almost 40 basis points (bps) to 2.5%.He wrote, ""In the short-term, the hurricanes serve as a drag but ultimately history suggests the rebuilding efforts underpin growth.""Of the banks mentioned above, Zions Bancorporation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2444,WFC,"Shares of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) have lost more than 2% year to date amid industry-wide weakness and legal issues, underperforming the industry’s rally of 9.5%.While the San Francisco, CA-based banking giant recorded growing deposits and loan balances over the past few years, displayed a strong capital position and remained focused on undertaking strategic acquisitions, the recent litigation issues have primarily challenged its profitability.Troubles have been mounting for Wells Fargo, following the revelation of opening of millions of unauthorized accounts, last year. ‘Cross-selling,’ which has been the company’s key strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of employees of the bank had unlawfully enrolled consumers in products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting sales targets. Though the bank is taking necessary steps to address the issue, it undoubtedly keeps the company’s financials under pressure for the near term.In addition to the above, persistent rise in operating expenses over the last few quarters seems to be a concern for Wells Fargo. The company remains focused on expense management with the target of eliminating $4 billion of expenses by 2019. Nevertheless, we believe its bottom line will continue to be affected in the near term on legal expenses related to the above-mentioned sales scam and other litigation issues.Additionally, Wells Fargo’s high debt burden remains another headwind. The company has debt-to-equity ratio of 1.32 compared with the industry average of 0.88. It underlines the financial instability of the company in an unstable economic environment.Further, Wells Fargo’s quarterly dividend payment might not be sustainable as its earnings have been volatile for the last several quarters. Also, given its high debt level and above-industry dividend payout ratio, continuation of dividend payout is doubtful which is disadvantageous for value investors.Moreover, Wells Fargo has been witnessing downward earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate declined 4.3% to $3.97 for 2017. For 2018, it moved down 2.5% to $4.32 during the same time frame.With Wells Fargo currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a Value Score of C, we don’t see it as an attractive investment option. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Investing in large-cap stocks is often perceived as a safe strategy to stay afloat amid market turmoil. However, it may not meet expectations at all times.Selecting the Winning StocksWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four finance stocks with market capitalization of more than $500 million. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 and have expected long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of more than 8%.Further, these have a Value Score of A or B.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are the four stocks that met the criteria:First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.

2445,WFC,"U.S. equity markets are going through a rough patch. There is a lot of political uncertainty as markets predict the odds of the timely passing of President Donald Trump’s tax reform bill. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing (read: 5 Ways to Play Growing Dividends With ETFs).Trump’s ImpactThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, uncertainty over the tax reform has pushed markets lower. Per Washington Post reports, Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one-year delay in reforms.Although the House approved their version of the bill, there are significant differences in the bill from the Senate’s version. Markets are therefore worried that this could create hindrance in the timely passing of the legislation (read: House Passes Tax Bill: Likely ETF Winners & Losers).Trump aims to cut down on stringent regulations to improve ease of doing business. He especially targets to cut a lot out of the Dodd Frank Act as he thinks it restricts business growth. However, there has been no major development in the space and markets are worried about his ability to pass his promised legislation.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. Although the North Korean supreme has been relatively silent over the past few weeks, there has been other developments in the global markets that has been concerning investors.Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman looked at tightening his grip on power by ordering a crackdown with arrests of royals, ministers and investors. Moreover, Houthi forces in Yemen fired a missile toward Riyadh’s international airport. The missile was intercepted midway and debris landed near the airport.“We see this as an act of war,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel Jubair, told CNN. Saudi Arabia accused Iran of providing necessary support to the rebels. Increased geopolitical risks have led to an increase in the price of oil and investors’ appeal for safety.In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends, while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

2446,WFC,"The start of Q3 earnings season is finally upon us, and the first significant handful of S&P 500 companies will release their latest quarterly results this week. Of these, the most highly anticipated reports will be those of our big financial firms—including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Major banks account for nearly half of the finance sector’s total earnings, so tracking these major U.S. financials should give us a relatively clear picture of the strength of this quarter. And after a relatively disappointing Q2 earnings season, bank stocks could use a rebound.Banks have already starting gaining momentum on the back of the GOP’s proposed tax cuts, and a fresh batch of solid quarterly reports should be exactly what the sector needs to finish 2017 on a high note. But what should investors expect to see from these major banks? Let’s take a closer look.1.       JPMorgan ChaseWith global assets worth over $2.5 trillion, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the biggest financial holding companies in the world. The bank is slated to report its latest quarterly results before the bell on October 12, and its success or failure could help set the tone as the busier part of Q3 season approaches.JPMorgan has surpassed our consensus estimate for earnings in each of the trailing seven quarters, including an impressive 15.92% beat in the latest period. Shares are up just over 4% since this latest report. The company has supported bottom line growth through streamlining efforts and branch consolidation, and an improved rate environment should offset challenges faced by its persistent fee income growth problem.Heading into the report, our latest consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $25.40 billion, which would reflect year-over-year growth of 5.62% and 2.93%, respectively. The stock is currently sporting a respectable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but its negative Earnings ESP—a metric that compares the consensus estimate with the most recent estimates in order to gauge latest analyst sentiment—reduces our ability to predict an earnings beat.It’s also worth noting that JPM could seem slightly undervalued compared to its industry right now. For example, its P/E ratio of 14.24 bests the Major Banks industry average of 15.46, and its P/CF ratio of 11.48 is slightly ahead of the industry’s 12.33. 2.       CitigroupWith an impressive earnings surprise streak under its belt and shares up more than 27% year-to-date, Citigroup is one of the hottest companies in the financial sector. This banking giant is preparing to release its most recent quarterly results before the market opens on October 12.Citigroup has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in ten straight quarters. In its most recent report, the company posted earnings that were nearly 5% than we were expecting, and shares have gained more than 9% since that report was released. Citigroup’s investments in core business and expense management have been encouraging, and the recent expansion of its wealth management business in Australia signal the company’s intentions to keep growing.Currently, our consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $1.30 per share and revenues of $17.73 billion. This earnings figure would represent year-over-year growth of 4.30%, while this revenue result would mark a slight slump from the year-ago quarter. Citigroup is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.29%, which makes surprise prediction more difficult.Still, with its P/E ratio of 14.44 and a PEG ratio of 1.48 coming in better than the respective industry averages of 15.46 and 1.72, some investors might consider Citigroup shares to be undervalued heading into the report. 3.       Wells FargoEmbroiled in a wide-ranging fraud scandal and at a low point in terms of brand favorability, Wells Fargo will desperately want a positive reaction to its new report. The struggling bank is slated to report its latest results before the bell on October 13.Wells Fargo has managed to beat our consensus estimate for earnings in four straight quarters, but the stock is flat on the year as investors continue to react to its phony checking account scheme.Heading into its report, Wells Fargo is a Zacks Rank #4 (Hold). We typically avoid poorly-ranked stocks at earnings time, and the company’s lackluster growth picture will likely repel even more investors. Our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $1.03 per share and revenue of $22.30 billion, both of which would be basically flat year-over-year.In the near term, the key details from Wells Fargo’s report will be management’s latest comments on the scandal and whether a satisfactory action plan has been produced. 4.       Bank of AmericaBank of America is one of the world’s most recognizable consumer banks, and a surprise uptick in investment banking has made it one of 2017’s most compelling stocks in the financial sector. The bank will look to continue this momentum with another solid report before the market opens on October 13.Bank of America has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, including a 6.98% beat in the most recent period. Since this latest report, shares have gained nearly 13%. The company’s gloomy view on trading revenues has been a concern, but increases in loan and deposit balances and streamlined overall operations have helped growth.Currently, our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $0.45 per share and revenues of $22.06 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 10.84% and 1.97%, respectively. BAC is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but its Earnings ESP of -0.66% makes surprise prediction more challenging.Bank of America’s current cash flow growth of 11.45% has outpaced the industry average, so investors should keep an eye on any further improvements to the company’s financial picture. For more on what to expect from the big bank’s this week, check out the latest analysis from Sheraz Mian, an acknowledged earnings expert and manager of the Zacks Equity Research department: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2447,WFC,"We issued an updated research report on Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) on Nov 20. The San Francisco-based company has traditionally followed organic and inorganic growth strategies. However, it is struggling with legal issues and escalating costs.Troubles mounted for Wells Fargo following the revelation of opening of millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. ‘Cross-selling’, which has been the company’s core strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention after it was discovered that numerous employees of the bank had unlawfully enrolled consumers in products and services without any consent.This was followed by the disclosure of issues in the bank’s auto insurance business and online bill pay services. Though Wells Fargo is taking necessary steps to address the issue, it undoubtedly puts the company’s financials under pressure for the near term.In the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing higher non-interest expenses. Wells Fargo is focused on expense management with the target of reducing $4 billion in costs by 2019. However, the company’s bottom line will continue to be hurt in the near term by legal expenses related to the sales scam and other litigation issues.Though the company has an impressive capital deployment plan with a decent dividend payout ratio, its debt/equity ratio compares unfavorably with that of the industry. Moreover, the company’s volatile performance in the past few quarters indicates that its capital deployment activities might not be sustainable, which will disappoint shareholders.However, easing margin pressure and substantial deposits provide some respite to the company. At the same time, Wells Fargo’s financials exhibit improving credit metrics.Nevertheless, analysts have a negative outlook on the stock. As a result, in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has declined marginally to $3.97 per share from $4.00. The estimate for 2018 earnings has been stable at $4.32.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2448,WFC,"A rise in trust income drove Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) earnings surprise of 7.1% in third-quarter 2017. Earnings came in at $1.20 per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12. Also, the figure compared favorably with $1.08 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Results benefited from increase in net interest income and non-interest income. In addition, the quarter witnessed a rise in assets under custody and assets under management. However, escalating operating expenses acted as a headwind.Net income came in at $298.4 million, up 12% year over year.Revenues Rise, Costs EscalateTotal revenues of $1.36 billion was marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 billion. The reported figure was up 11% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $366.2 million was up 11% year over year. This was driven by increased levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin was 1.29%, up 15 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable mix shift in balance sheet.Non-interest income grew 9% from the year-ago quarter to $991 million. Increase in trust, investment and other servicing fees, other operating income, and security commissions and trading income were the primary drivers for improvement.Non-interest expenses were up 11% year over year to $935.6 million in the quarter. This was mainly due to an increase in most components of expenses.Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Sep 30, 2017, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody increased 16% year over year to $7.75 trillion, while total assets under management rose 19% to $1.13 trillion.Improvement in Credit QualityTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $173.4 million, down 23% year over year. Net recoveries were $1.6 million, up from $0.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Also, credit provision was $7 million in the quarter compared with $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, non-performing assets declined 20% year over year to $145.5 million as of Sep 30, 2017.  Strong Capital PositionUnder the Advanced Approach, as of Sep 30, 2017, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio were 14.6%, 16.5% and 8% respectively, each exceeding the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment ActivitiesDuring the third quarter, Northern Trust repurchased 1.41 million shares for $124.8 million at an average price of $88.43 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the consistent growth in assets under custody, revenues and an improving credit quality to some extent.However, costs continue to escalate due to ongoing investments in technology impacting compensation and equipment and software expenses. Further, elevated levels of non-performing assets remain a major concern.Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteCurrently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other Major BanksCitigroup Inc.

Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects a 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2449,WFC,"BancorpSouth, Inc. (BXS  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of 43 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. Also, the bottom line compared favorably with the year-ago quarter earnings of 39 cents. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest revenue and lower expenses, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. Loans and deposit balances remained strong during the quarter. However, the company recorded provisions in the quarter, which was a headwind.Including mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) valuation adjustment, the company’s net income amounted to $39.5 million or 43 cents per share, increasing from $37.8 million or 40 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Net Interest Revenues Up, Expenses DownQuarterly net revenues increased 1.2% year over year to $186.5 million. However, the reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $191.2 million.Net interest revenues came in at $120.6 million, up 5.2% year over year. Fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) was 3.58%, increasing 7 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter figure.Non-interest revenues decreased 5.3% year over year to $66 million. The decline was primarily due to a fall in mortgage banking revenues and deposit service charges. These decreases were partially offset by high insurance commissions and other income.Non-interest expenses were $126.9 million, decreasing 1.1% on a year-over-year basis.As of Sep 30, 2017, total deposits were $11.8 billion, down 1.4% sequentially, while net loans and leases grew marginally to $10.9 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing loans and leases were 0.59% of net loans and leases as of Sep 30, 2017, down from 0.85% as of Sep 30, 2016. Additionally, allowance for credit losses to net loans and leases was 1.08%, down from 1.18% registered in the comparable period last year.

The ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets contracted 30 bps to 9.56%.Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 0.7 million common shares at an average price of $28.99 per share.Our ViewpointPersistent decline in mortgage banking revenues continues to be a major concern for the company. Though, NIM improved in the quarter, it has been declining since the past few years. Thus, lower NIM might hurt the company’s top line growth. Further, the company’s significant exposure to risky loan portfolios might hamper its financials in the near term.BancorpSouth, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BancorpSouth, Inc.

Earnings per share of $1.12 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the bottom line came in 28.7% higher than the prior-year quarter figure of 87 cents.Better-than-expected results were driven by rise in revenues and lower provisions. Organic growth was reflected, with significant rise in loans and deposit balances. However, elevated expenses remained the undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders was $56.2 million, up 39.5% year over year.Revenues Rise, Loans & Deposits Go Up, Costs EscalateTotal revenues (net of interest expense) jumped 21.8% year over year to $223.4 million in the quarter, driven by higher net interest income and non-interest income. Moreover, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $213.1 million.Texas Capital’s net interest income was $204.4 million, up 22.6% year over year. In addition, net interest margin expanded 45 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.59%. This resulted from improvement in earning asset composition and the favorable impact of increased interest rates on loan yields.Texas Capital’s non-interest income surged 13.8% year over year to $19 million. The rise was primarily due to an increase in service charges, servicing income, wealth management and trust fee income, along with bank owned life insurance income. These were partially offset by lower brokered loan fees, swap fees and other income.However, non-interest expenses increased 21.1% year over year to $114.8 million. This mainly stemmed from a rise in almost all components of expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, total loans rose 16.9% year over year to $21.4 billion while deposits climbed 5.5% year over year to $19.1 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets totaled 0.67% of the loan portfolio plus other real estate owned assets, reflecting a year-over-year contraction of 40 bps.

Tangible common equity to total tangible assets came in at 8.2% compared with 7% in the prior-year quarter.Stockholders’ equity was up 25% year over year to $2.2 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. The uptrend was chiefly allied with retention of net income and proceeds from common stock offering during fourth-quarter 2016.Our ViewpointTexas Capital’s improved top line and a better balance sheet during the quarter impress us. However, bleak economic situation may hurt the company’s performance in the future. Though its inability to control expenses may hamper profitability going ahead, improvement in margin remains a favorable factor.Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.

2456,WFC,"The Dow suffered a loss of more than 200 points on Tuesday to register its worst one-day drop since Aug 17, ending its four day winning streak. Such losses were incurred after investors rotated out of relatively riskier assets due to escalating tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. Likelihood of the fallout of another hurricane named Irma over the coast of Florida sent home insurers lower.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,987.56, declining 234.25 points or 1.1%. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) was the Dow’s biggest decliner after its shares tanked 5.7% following a deal with Rockwell Collins to purchase the latter for $30 billion. The S&P 500 Index (INX) dipped 0.8% to close at 2,457.85, ending a six day winning streak and recording its worst daily drop since Aug 17. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,375.57, decreasing 0.9%. Trade volumes remained lower on Tuesday due to Labor Day holiday.A total of 6.7 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.34-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.14-to-1 ratio. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX) increased 21% to 12.23.Geopolitical Tensions Send Shivers Down the MarketsThe CBOE Volatility index (VIX), widely regarded as the fear guage in the market, briefly jumped more than 38% to 14 on Tuesday. This was because of the escalating geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the United States. Over the weekend, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear bomb, raising geopolitical instability in the Korean Peninsula and between Pyongyang and Washington.The latest missile test resulted in North Korea earning flak from leaders in the U.S. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis warned Pyongyang that it would have to face  “a massive military response” in case of it attacked the U.S. or any of its allies such as South Korea and Japan. “We have many military options and the President wanted to be briefed on each one of them,”  said Mattis on Sunday afternoon.Moreover, South Korea’s defense ministry announced that North Korea was preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile. Major General Jang Kyung-soo, the acting deputy minister for national defense policy, South Korea, said there are indications that North Korea will launch another ICBM, which they would test around Sep 9, their Foundation Day. Such statements hurt investor sentiments.Investors Rotate Out of Financials into BondsThe S&P 500 suffered its worst daily drop since Aug 17 following a nosedive in shares o financials. Eight of the S&P 500’s 11 main sectors closed lower, with financials leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost 2.10%, suffering its worst decline since May. Such a decline was the result of investors moving out of stocks that would have benefitted from tax deregulations to safer havens such as bonds. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith on Trump Administration’s ability to push through the much awaited tax reforms. Moreover, the recent rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington also led investors to rotate out of riskier assets.The rotation from financial shares into bonds led to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes falling to 2.07%, its lowest level since Nov 9, 2016. Shares of financial companies nosedived on Tuesday. Also weighing on treasury bonds were comments fromFederal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard. According to Brainard, the Fed should slow down the momentum of interest rate hikes in the face of relatively lower inflation rates which have not hit the target of 2% over the past five years. “In that case, it would be prudent to raise the federal funds rate more gradually,” she commented.Shares of JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined 2.4%, 3.2%, 1.7%, 1.7%, 2.1% and 3.6%. Losses for financial shares also weighed heavily on the Dow. HSBC possesses a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) whereas the other companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This weighed on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Shares of Everest Group (RE  -  Free Report) and XL Group (XL  -  Free Report) tumbled 6.9% and 5.8% respectively. Shares of Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report) also tanked 3.7%, scraping off almost 31 points from the Dow.

2457,WFC,"Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) shares climbed on Tuesday morning after Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) upgraded the media giant’s stock.Wells Fargo upgraded Disney from ""market perform"" to ""outperform"" and raised its price target to $116 a share from $109 a share, which would mark a 14% gain from Friday's close. The firm pointed to Disney’s new commitment to enter the streaming and over-the-top programming sector as the key reason for its renewed faith in the media powerhouse.Disney recently announced that it expects to introduce a Disney brand direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. The company also hopes to roll out a streaming version of the struggling ESPN channel as soon as 2018.“With DIS’s foray into direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming, we can’t help but believe the TV ecosystem will soon embark on an accelerated over-the-top (OTT) path,” Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Monday. “Thus, investors may need to start thinking about increasing exposure to those media cos. with solid streaming strategies, such as CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), FOXA (FOXA  -  Free Report), and DIS…”Disney announced in early August that the company would leave Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to set up an exclusive streaming platform for all Disney and Pixar movies.""We like the entry point for DIS even if we're early. … We view the risk/reward as heavily skewed to the upside,"" Ryvicker noted. ""We continue to believe Disney is a premium brand with one of the best management teams in media.""Wells Fargo also said that if Disney’s move into video streaming is successful that “we might even see the stock return to trading at a 1-2x premium to the market, putting the stock at $128/share.”Disney’s stock has had an up and down year thus far, and shares of the conglomerate have dropped significantly from its 52-week high water mark of $116 a share that it reached in April.Shares of Disney popped over 1% in morning trading on Tuesday, but now hover around 0.50% higher than Friday’s closing price at $102 a share.Other Note Highlights Ryvicker upgraded Disney based on a strong belief in the company’s ability to successfully progress into the world of digital streaming. The same Wells Fargo note cautioned investors about media companies that don’t have enough exposure in nonlinear television.The analyst pointed to three companies—Discovery Communications (DISCA  -  Free Report), Scripps Networks , and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report)—as media outlets that could potentially be hurt as the shift towards streaming continues to heat up.Ryvicker singled out Viacom as being particularly exposed and downgraded the stock accordingly. Ryvicker downgraded Viacom’s non-voting stock to “market perform” from “outperform.” The analyst also lowered her price target from $43 a share to $32 a share. Shares of Scripps Networks fell marginally, while Discovery Communications saw its stock price sink by around 1% to touch a new 52-week intraday trading low of $21.89 a share.Viacom’s class B shares dropped by over 3.20% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading low. The company’s voting  shares dipped by roughly 2%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2458,WFC,"The recent disclosures by the Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has raised skepticism over the mega bank’s existence. It revealed to have identified an additional 1.4 million fake accounts apart from the 2.1 million accounts disclosed last September.After being pressured by the legislators for expanding the review period from the beginning of 2009 instead of 2011, the new discovery was made. Investigation of about 165 million deposit and credit-card accounts found that the employees had been conducting illegal sales practices for an even longer period.Wells Fargo stated that of the total unauthorized accounts that were opened, about 190,000 had incurred fees and other charges compared with 130,000 disclosed earlier. The bank is now expected to pay $10.7 million in compensation to its customers, which includes refunds of about $7 million, up from $3.3 million previously.It has been almost a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s involvement in unfair sales practices had spread in the market. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, Wells Fargo had to go through a lot of restructuring. Its executives faced pay cuts and about 5000 employees were fired.Further, the repercussions of this new disclosure keep us anxious.The review also revealed issues with the online bill pay service that the bank provides to its customers. It was uncovered that about 528,000 unauthorized online bill-pay enrollments were made without customers’ knowledge. The reviewers found those accounts to have only one transaction of a nominal amount. The bank has promised to refund $910,000 to the affected customers.Currently, Wells Fargo is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for the bank till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past year reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 1.7%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 26.8%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Washington Federal, Inc.

2459,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Though rise in rates provided some respite, lower revenues aided by a fall in non-interest income were recorded. Moreover, expenses soared. Further, reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter. Though the bank’s commercial portfolio improved, consumer loans disappointed. Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced.Third-quarter net income came in at $4.6 billion, down from $5.6 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter. Results included $1 billion worth of discrete litigation accrual.The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior-year quarter figure of $22.3 billion.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, revenue generation at the business segments was mixed. Community Banking and Wholesale Banking segments’ total quarterly revenue decreased around 2.4% and 1%, respectively, while Wealth and Investment Management revenues increased around 2.4%.Loans Fall, Interest Income Rise, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.5 billion, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities, loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin expanded 5 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.87%, reflecting the rising interest-rate environment.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.5 billion, down 9% year over year, primarily due to low mortgage banking revenues, lower net gains from trading activities and reduced service charges on deposit accounts.As of Sep 30, 2017, total loans were $951.9 billion, down around 1% year over year. Reduction in its consumer loan portfolio was recorded, partially offset by growth in commercial loans. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, in line with the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $14.4 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from rise in almost all components of expenses. Nonetheless, Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reductions of $4 billion by the end of 2019.The company’s efficiency ratio of 65.5% was above 59.4% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.1 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, down 4.7% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $717 million, declining 11% year over year. Net charge-offs were $717 million or 0.30% of average loans in the reported quarter, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter net charge-offs of $805 million (0.33%). Non-performing assets were down 22.5% to $9.3 billion in the quarter under review from $12 billion in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the reported quarter, the company returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $152.8 billion from $147.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.8% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 10.7% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share advanced to $36.96 from $35.81 recorded in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported a disappointing quarter. Top-line headwinds, aided by lower non-interest income, persist. Further, escalating expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business. However, improved credit quality was a positive.This banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services. Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer — Timothy Sloan — apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come.We believe, over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also believe strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability. Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteCurrently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in third-quarter 2017 on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and elevated interest rates supported net interest income. In addition, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth.

2460,WFC,"New pre-market reads this morning from important inflation metrics and some of the largest companies on Wall Street inform this Friday the 13th. Results are not scary (which should be a relief to the superstitious among us). Instead, they look to be fairly Goldilocks-like: pointed in the right direction, but still under control.The Consumer Price Index (CPI), like the Producer Price Index (PPI) that came out ahead of the opening bell yesterday, ratcheted up noticeably in September: +0.5% (PPI was +0.4%). This was 10 basis points lower than expected, but still robust. A half a percentage point gain month over month helps agencies like the Fed make up their minds about raising interest rates, likely at its December meeting. (Odds for this occurring are now over 90%.) Year over year, the CPI is +2.2%.Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the CPI was only +0.1, whereas +0.2% had been expected. Which means that, although increased pricing is going to help get inflation up to the Fed’s desired 2%, the majority of these gains month over month may be a little more fluid. It may not be ideal, but it is a position we’ve gotten used to with incremental changes on this sort of economic data.Retail Sales in September also rose, this time by +1.6%. Again, a tenth of a point lower than expected, but still in the right direction for seeing the positive influence of inflation affecting our economy. Ex-automobile sales, retail sales dips to +1.0%, which is higher than the +0.8% analysts had anticipated. More data to support the narrative that the economy is perking, but without froth.Q3 Earnings ResultsBoth Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) posted Q3 earnings results ahead of regular trading today. While BofA beat on the bottom line by 2 cents per share and narrowly squeaked a positive surprise in revenues, Wells Fargo met the Zacks earnings consensus exactly but came up short on quarterly payments.Bank of America has beaten earnings estimates for at least the past five quarters in a row, at an average of 12.5% over the trailing four quarters. The big bank’s 48 cents per share was a more modest improvement over the 46 cents expected. Despite a weaker trading quarter, revenues of $22.1 billion beat the $22.0 billion in the Zacks consensus, and bettered the $21.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.Wells Fargo reported litigation expenses of $1 billion to help account for its $1.04 earnings per share, in-line with our consensus. Interestingly, this chunk set aside for litigation is not related to Wells Fargo’s fake account scandal, which will require further capital outlays over time to right this part of the ship. Wells’ Efficiency Ratio (non-interest expense/revenues) ballooned up to 65.5% in the quarter, though subtracting one-off payments like this litigation expense, this number falls to 61%, a full percentage point improvement quarter over quarter.Wells Fargo shares are trading down roughly 2.5% ahead of the opening bell. Bank of America shares are flat pre-open, after a slight sell-off from earlier this month, remain trading at multi-year highs.

2462,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) guaranteed auto protection (GAP) insurance program is currently under investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Under the bank’s GAP insurance, a customer gets coverage on the difference between the amount he owes on a car loan and the value an insurance company will give him if the car is destroyed in an accident or stolen. The customers are entitled to a refund of some portion of the GAP insurance in case loans are paid off early.In its filing issued last week, the bank disclosed that it found some issues relating to its GAP insurance product. The borrowers were not returned the amount they were entitled to.Wells Fargo has now started issuing refunds to the eligible customers in several states. Further, the bank is closely monitoring its auto-lending business as it fears that it may drive attention of the regulators.Currently, Wells Fargo is in midst of a number of pending probes and lawsuits, which are not likely to end anytime soon.

2463,WFC,"Troubles are not yet over for Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). A federal lawsuit has been filed against the company’s joint venture with payment processor First Data Corp (FDC  -  Free Report), accusing it of misleading thousands of merchants by charging them unauthorized fees. The news was first reported by Reuters.The venture, known as Wells Fargo Merchant Services was formed to help small businesses and other merchants across the country to process their credit and debit card transactions. It had promised to provide a transparent pricing policy to the merchants.However, per the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn on Friday, on behalf of Patti's Pitas, a now closed restaurant in Pennsylvania, tour operator Queen City Tours in Charlotte, NC, and other merchants, the venture had not been living up to its promises.It was overbilling merchants for its services and had been charging them with unanticipated fees which they were claiming to be ""interchange charges."" The venture claimed that the fee was being charged by some credit card network, but actually it was they who were making profit out of the same.Also, Wells Fargo framed a 63-page contract which had to be signed by the merchants. The contract was quite complicated and beyond the capacity of merchants to understand. Upon signing, the merchants were hit by some unauthorized monthly charges.Sara Hassell, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said, ""We deny the claims and plan to defend against the misrepresentations outlined in the lawsuit."" On the contrary, Mark Murphy, the spokesman for First Data did not comment.This is not the first time Wells Fargo has faced legal action for misleading sales tactics. The company is already struggling with a nationwide lawsuit filed against its employees for unfair cross-selling practices by opening unauthorized accounts.Last year, it agreed to pay $185 million to the U.S. government to settle such claims.In the last one year, shares of the company have gained only 7.4%, underperforming the 35.6% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).Carolina Financial witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 4.5% for the current year, over the last 60 days.

2464,WFC,"After a deeper investigation into its fraudulent sales scheme, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) revealed that it discovered up to 1.4 million more fake accounts than it previously estimated, leading famous Wall Street commentator Jim Cramer to declare the company a “rogue bank.”Wells Fargo just announced this new twist in its phony account scandal, which began after the allegations surfaced nearly a year ago, and now it looks like the extent of the bank’s fraud was significantly greater than anyone expected.The company said it has now found a total of 3.5 million potentially fake bank and credit card accounts, up from the previous total of about 2.1 million. The newly discovered accounts were found during an analysis that searched back to January 2009 and reviewed the original suspect period from May 2011 to mid-2015.On top of this, Wells Fargo said that it discovered a brand new issue, as more than 500,000 people were found to be enrolled in online bill pay without their consent. These new revelations are causing a deserved uproar around the markets on Thursday.“It's not embarrassing, it's rogue. This is a rogue bank,” said CNBC’s Jim Cramer. “They thought they got to the bottom of it but they left out a million accounts. That does not seem like the bottom of this. This is so outrageous.”Cramer also called on members of Congress to continue investigating the company. Earlier this year, Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for the ouster of 12 Wells Fargo board members.Meanwhile, billionaire investor Warren Buffett took to the airwaves to defend the bank. “What you find is there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen when you start looking around,” the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) told CNBC. Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder.Shares of the bank were down nearly 0.7% through early morning trading hours Thursday. The stock has now lost about 5.5% over the last month, bringing its year-to-date slump to nearly -7%. As for now, Wells Fargo remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2465,WFC,"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $48.3 billion, up 10.7% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $5.7 billion, up 8.5% year over year.Banks’ earnings were stemmed by higher revenues and loan growth. On the other hand, expenses flared up and loan loss provisions rose.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, contributed a major part of the earnings in the reported quarter. Though such banks constitute only 1.8% of the total number of the U.S. banks, these accounted for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Leading names in this space include Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).All the above mentioned banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Revenues Escalate, Costs Flare UpBanks have been consistently striving to reap profits and are consequently boosting productivity. Around 63.4% of all institutions, insured by the FDIC, reported improvement in quarterly net income, while the remaining recorded a decline in comparison to the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the percentage of institutions reporting net losses for the quarter edged down to 4.1% from 4.6% in the year-ago quarter.The measure for profitability or average return on assets (ROA) inched up to 1.14% from 1.08% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Net operating revenue was $190.5 billion, up 6.1% year over year.  A rise in net interest income, as well as non-interest income, was the driving factor.Net interest income was recorded at $123.7 billion, up 9.1% year over year, driven by rise in interest-bearing assets and net interest margin (NIM). NIM advanced to 3.22% from 3.08% recorded in the year-earlier quarter. It depicts highest average margin for the industry since fourth-quarter 2013.Non-interest income for the banks climbed 1% year over year to $66.8 billion. Increase in servicing income stemmed this rise, mostly offset by lower trading income and reduced gains on asset sales.Total non-interest expenses for the establishments were $108.6 billion in the quarter, up 3.3% on a year-over-year basis. Increase in salary, and employee benefit costs and other non-interest expense led to this rise.Credit Quality a Concern?Overall, credit quality was a mixed bag in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs increased to $11.3 billion, up 11.2% year over year, reflecting the seventh quarterly rise. Notably, higher credit card charge-offs led to this rise.In the reported quarter, provisions for loan losses for the institutions came in at $12.0 billion, up 2.3% year over year. The level of non-current loans and leases decreased 14.5% year over year to $116.6 billion, indicating the 28th decline in non-current loan balances in the last 29 quarters. The non-current rate was 1.23%, reflecting the lowest rate since third-quarter 2007.Strong Loan & Deposit GrowthThe capital position of the banks remained solid. Total deposits continued to rise and were recorded at $13.1 trillion, up 4.6% year over year. Further, total loans and leases were $9.5 trillion, up 3.7% year over year.As of Jun 30, 2017, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased to $87.6 billion from $77.9 billion as of Jun 30, 2016. Furthermore, interest earned on investment securities and assessment income primarily led to the growth in fund balance.Less Bank Failures, Shrinking Problem InstitutionsDuring second-quarter 2017, three banks failed, while 62 were merged. As of Jun 30, 2017, the number of ‘problem’ banks declined from 112 to 105, underlining the lowest number in more than seven years and significantly decreased from 888 recorded in first-quarter 2011. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions decreased to $17.2 billion from $23.7 billion.Our ViewpointThe decline in the number of problem institutions looks encouraging with the quarter witnessing top-line growth on higher NIM. Banks have been gradually easing lending standards and trending toward higher fees to counter pressure on the top line. In addition, more interest rate hikes will dodge the pressure on interest income. Then, again, consistent expense control and stable balance sheets will likely act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters.With lingering uncertainty in the economy, we do not see this issue-ridden sector returning to its pre-recession levels anytime soon. What encourages us though is that a lot depends on to what extent Trump lives up to his promises. Bank stocks may be hit hard if he does not deliver on certain policy goals.The Fed’s actions on expediting rate hike – which is again a function of economic growth based on Trump’s policy alterations – will also play a key role in keeping the optimism on bank stocks alive.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2466,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is in trouble once again for causing inconvenience to its customers by closing authentic bank accounts and making their funds inaccessible. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently investigating the matter.Per an article by Reuters, customers have complained of fraudulent deposits whose origin cannot be identified. Some claimed that their identities were stolen and their accounts were closed by the bank.

2467,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, investors’ pessimistic stance continued for the banking stocks. Release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting indicated a divide over the timing of interest rate hikes. The primary reason for this is the expectation of inflation staying below the Fed’s targeted level of 2% for an extended period.While banks, at present, are reaping benefits from higher rates (easing margin pressure and increase in interest income), it now seems uncertain when the next rate hike will occur. This is perhaps one of the reasons that affected investors’ confidence in the banking stocks to some extent.Also, disbanding of President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council and the Strategy & Policy Forum indicate continued disruptions happening in the White House. Though this development is not likely to directly affect several proposed policy initiatives that are expected to strengthen the economy, investors now seem to be concerned over the timing.Apart from these macro factors, banks continue to reel from litigation and regulatory probes. Legal headwinds pertaining to business malpractices in the pre-crisis period persist.On the other hand, banks are intending to boost profitability through streamlining strategies. Also, with an aim to focus more on diversifying revenue base, banks are increasing market share in lucrative sectors.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Aug 11, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. Per a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) merchant services division has been accused of charging small business with unacceptable fees for credit card transactions. Also, the bank has been alleged to have charged excessively high fees for early termination. (Read more: Wells Fargo Accused of Levying High Early Termination Fees)2. A lawsuit has been filed in the federal court in Manhattan by three public pension funds against six major banks. In the suit filed by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, Orange County Employees' Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association, the banks have been accused of collaborating and conspiring to remove competition from the stock lending market.The accused banks are Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG.In the stock lending market, investors can sell a stock without owning it through a process called short selling. Investors or firms borrow stock with the help of agents by paying a fee and then sell it expecting to buy it again in the future at a lower price.Some upstart lending platforms were developed to help various borrowers and lenders interact directly without the use of middlemen.However, the above mentioned banks have been accused of trying to boycott and hence block the development of such lending platforms over the years. This was done to remove competition from the lending market and thereby charge higher fee from borrowers who wanted to engage in short selling. The act is in violation of the federal antitrust law.Moreover, in order to prevent borrowers from going to other places in the market to get better prices, the banks had created a lending platform of their own called EquiLend LLC. It is through this platform that the banks have been trying to develop anticompetitive strategies in the market to safeguard their interests.3. Capital One Financial Corp.

2469,WFC,"Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects a 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Likewise, underwriting fees (both equity and fixed income) witnessed a fall. Also, a decline in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and fall in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind.Apart from these, results were adversely impacted by an increase in provision for credit losses, mainly due to reserve build in Card portfolio.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate & Investment Bank, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, both credit card sales volume and merchant processing volume grew 13%. Further, both Commercial Banking average loan balances and Asset Management average loan balances rose 10%.Trading Slump Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs DownManaged net revenues of $26.2 billion in the quarter were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.7 billion. Rising rates and loan growth were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues, investment banking fees and mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.3 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily driven by lower marketing costs and stable compensation expenses, partially offset by technology, communications and equipment costs.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for credit losses increased 14% year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily due to reserve build in Consumer loan portfolio. Also, net charge-offs were up 13% year over year to $1.3 billion.However, as of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.2 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Sep 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Sep 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 16.1% (estimated) as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 15.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.Book value per share was $66.95 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $63.79 as of Sep 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $54.03 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $51.23 as of Sep 30, 2016.Bottom LineContinued improvement in loans and higher interest rates are projected to support JPMorgan’s revenues, going forward. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates, the company’s interest income will likely increase.However, slowdown in trading owing to low volatility and muted investment banking performance are likely to continue in the near term.J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteCurrently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2470,WFC,"In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors.In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun. Futures this Monday morning are all up a half-hour before regular-day trading begins.

2471,WFC,"Recently, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) announced that it entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to pay $108 million for a lawsuit settlement.Filed in 2006, the lawsuit claimed that some Veterans Administration (VA) Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans (IRRRLs) originated by Wells Fargo should not have been eligible for VA guarantees on account of the fees charged to the borrowers. However, the bank had denied all allegations.In 2011, the bank had provided compensation to all veterans who received a VA IRRRL from Wells Fargo between Jan 20, 2004 and Oct 7, 2010.Per Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo, this settlement would allow the bank to look ahead and rebuild trust of shareholders. However, the bank’s troubles are unlikely to end soon.Wells Fargo’s structure, composition and practices are all under review and is expected to be completed in the third quarter.The bank is reviewing whether fees charged to extend the interest rate lock periods on residential mortgages and its practice of freezing deposit accounts for suspected fraud caused undue harm to customers.Last week, the bank disclosed that it charged about 570,000 auto borrowers for insurance they did not want. This resulted inabout 274,000 of them defaulting on loans. Further, it led to nearly 20,000 unjustified repossessions.The bank’s involvement in such legal proceedings are likely to keep hurting its reputation and lower investor confidence. Further, the legal costs are expected to remain on the higher side.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 4.1% year to date, underperforming the 7.3% rally for the industry.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the financial space include Washington Federal, Inc.

2472,WFC,"We are now on the bck half of Q2 earnings season. While most banks that reported results this week managed to beat estimates, concerns over underlying weakness shadowed the optimism.Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins. However, lower treasury yields curbed the benefits to some extent. Also, a rise in deposit balances and manageable expense level supported the results.Investment banking fees were favorable but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter.

2473,WFC,"We expect PayPal Holdings, Inc.

2474,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. Though most banks which reported second-quarter 2017 results this week managed to beat estimates, concerns over the underlying weakness shadowed the optimism.Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins. However, lower treasury yields curbed the benefits. Additionally, rise in deposit balances and lower provisions driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio were impressive.Investment banking fees were favorable, but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume were on the downside.Though the absence of exceptionally high legal expenses was a big support, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 14, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

2475,WFC,"The Dow continued to trade within a tight band during a week dominated by earnings. Investors refrained from posting big bets on Monday, leading to the index ending mostly unchanged. Earnings results guided the Dow’s fortunes over the next two trading days of the week. However, it was a deal between two retailing majors which led to losses for a key component, and hence for the index itself on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row last Friday. The 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year, increasing by 0.4% as tech stocks gained. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all posted better-than-expected earnings results.But shares of these banking-behemoths fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic reports on retail sales and inflation, which led market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The index gained 1% last week even as all major benchmarks posted solid gains. The indexes overcame a series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.The Dow This WeekThe index declined a meager 0.04% on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players that were slated for release during this week.The index declined 0.3% on Tuesday weighed down by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). Shares of the banking behemoth slipped after reporting a staggering 40% drop in second-quarter bond trading revenue. Meanwhile, shares of Netflix, Inc.

Netflix’s gains helped other benchmarks close in the green.The Dow gained 0.3% on Wednesday. Benchmarks closed at record highs on Wednesday boosted partly by broad-based gains in technology shares. Meanwhile, IBM Corp’s (IBM  -  Free Report) disappointing quarterly results limited the Dow’s advance. Nevertheless, the blue-chip index still managed to finish at a record high.The deal between Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) weighed on home improvement retailers on Thursday. This in turn dragged the Dow 0.1% lower after Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) lost 4.1%.

However, earnings witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback.

COST co-brand portfolio.The company reaffirmed its earlier EPS guidance of $5.60–$5.80 for 2017.

2477,WFC,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its earnings are likely to improve year over year, but revenues might decline.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Wells Fargo has undertaken a number of steps to restore its reputation, post scandal. Recently, at a heated senator meeting, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer — Timothy Sloan — vigorously tried defending America’s third-largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators.Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come. The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance.Amid such adversities, shares of Wells Fargo have gained just around 1% so far, this year, significantly lagging 10.5% growth recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release exert more pressure on the stock? Notably, Wells Fargo delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.99%. However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat in the third quarter.Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteA stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.06. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Notably, management projects technology costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter, before declining in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be in the range of 60-61%, but the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by year-end 2019.Notably, legal costs related to sales scam scandal might also escalate expenses for the bank.Mortgage Business to Surge:  Wells Fargo — one of the largest mortgage lenders in the nation — might record rise in mortgage banking revenues. Higher mortgage banking is expected on stronger origination volumes. However, the bank projects decline in the auto portfolio to reflect lower origination volumes. Management tightened credit underwriting standards in response to early signs of rising delinquencies in the industry and declining used car values. As a result, the quality of originations has improved and the company expects the size of the auto portfolio to decline persistently in 2017.Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue in the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Notably, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

2478,WFC,"Big banks are gearing up for the third-quarter earnings season this week. Investors are hopeful that bank profits will rise on the White House’s intention to slash corporate taxes and ease banking regulations. Higher wage growth, in the meantime, is expected to counter setbacks stemming from soft loan growth. Yet, multiple banks believe that trading revenues are trending lower in the current quarter.Nevertheless, let us focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season. Such banks are poised to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.America’s Leading Banks Mint MoneyFive of America’s biggest banks are expected to register $21 billion in profits in Q3. Such banks include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC  -  Free Report).Undoubtedly, JP Morgan is the most valuable U.S. bank, with assets more than $2.1 trillion. Jamie Dimon’s company is likely to post $6.4 billion in profits in Q3, which will in time make it the most profitable. The shares of the bank have already seen steady gains since June 2016. Such gains came in despite the latest dip in September that hit the 200-day simple moving average.Citigroup’s shares also continue to hit milestones, thanks to a more than 50% surge since Trump’s election. The banking behemoth is now worth more than $200 billion. Bank of America, in the meantime, celebrated a landmark of its own last week, when its share price touched the $26 mark for the first time since September 2008, the month Lehman Brothers had shut down.Wells Fargo also continues to make big money, even if its CEO Tim Sloan faces tough questions regarding the recent auto insurance and mortgage fee controversies. The bank is expected to register $5 billion in profits in the said quarter. And don’t forget, PNC Financial Services, the sixth largest bank in terms of asset size, is positioned to see the strongest earnings growth from last quarter.But, it’s just not the large banks that are expected to make money. The overall banking industry is doing really well. Bank stocks, collectively, are up more than 8% over the past month, roughly double the S&P 500’s performance in that time period (read more: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?).And how can we forget that banks have already earned a record $48.3 billion in Q2, which was well above the pre-crisis high of $38 billion in 2006, according to the FDIC.Banks Set to Gain Under Trump’s Tax Plan & DeregulationIt’s no wonder that bank’s profitability will be enhanced by proposed tax cuts and deregulation. The corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%.Lowering of domestic tax rate will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This will, ultimately, boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.The Republican, bill better known as the Financial Choice Act, in the meanwhile, would free up banks by giving more power to banking authorities and spurring lending activities.Loan Growth, Trading Activities SoftWe shouldn’t forget that loan growth for commercial banks has declined precipitously since last November, to 2.1% from 8.1%, as per the Federal Reserve data.Higher wage growth, however, is expected to drive demand for retail and small business loan. Wages have increased 0.5% to average of $26.55 an hour in September, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.But, the major concern for banks is lack of activity on trading floors. Jamie Dimon expects trading revenue decline of 20% in the three months ending September 30, while Citigroup’s Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach also expects trading revenues to fall 15% from the year-ago period. Bank of America did confirm that it’s seeing a similar trend. The only hope in this case is that investment pros expect markets to be choppier in the later half of this year, which could well spur trading activities.5 Bank Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q3Barring a drop in trading revenues, banks are likely to see solid growth in Q3. This calls for investing in five banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q3 earnings. These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP.

2479,WFC,"The earnings season is knocking at the door and investors must be interested in knowing how banks (one of the industries that have been in the spotlight for quite some time now) are likely to perform.Will the major banks be able replicate first-half 2017 performance? Let’s check out how the factors have played out this time.The Fed’s interest rate hike in June had full-quarter impact during the third quarter. Thus, the pressure on margins is expected to continue easing. Further, per the Fed’s latest data, loans continued to increase. Both consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans are projected to rise while commercial real estate loans might fall. So, interest income for banks is expected to improve marginally.Typically, the third quarter is a seasonally weak period on the capital markets front, and it was not different this time. While debt underwriting continued to rise (mainly on assumption of persistent increase in interest rates) and fixed income trading flows were stable, slowdown in equity issuance, weak equity trading volumes and overall low volumes of M&As are expected to hurt fee income growth for banks to some extent.On the cost front, as the majority of avoidable expenses have already been cut by banks, expense reduction will less likely be a big support. Also, as banks move toward improving their digital offerings, expenses are bound to marginally rise.Per our latest Earnings Preview, Major Banks (accounting for nearly 45% of the Finance sector’s total earnings) is expected to witness a 5.1% year-over-year decline in earnings in the quarter. This compares unfavorably with the 10% growth witnessed in the prior quarter.This week, four major banks are scheduled to announce their third-quarter results. Let’s have a closer look at what to expect.Like always, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) will kick-start earnings season for the major banks. The company is slated to announce results on Thursday, Oct 12 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of -0.53%, the chances of earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter is less. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Sluggish trading activities during the quarter are expected to be a major undermining factor for JPMorgan. Trading revenues are projected to decrease 20% year over year as indicated by CEO Jamie Dimon. Though overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter will marginally hurt investment banking fees, higher debt origination is expected to be a saving grace. A slight improvement in lending activities along with higher interest rates is anticipated to result in an increase in interest income.Notably, JPMorgan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:J P Morgan Chase & Co Price and EPS Surprise  J P Morgan Chase & Co Price and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteAnother big bank, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), will also report earnings on Oct 12. Similar to JPMorgan, our quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this time. The company has Earnings ESP of -0.29% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Citigroup’s earnings are expected to be adversely impacted by a decline in trading income (down 15% year over year) and lower equity underwriting fees. Also, credit costs are anticipated to rise. However, improving interest income (driven by loan growth and higher interest rates) and an increase in debt underwriting fees will support bottom line.Citigroup outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Citigroup Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citigroup Inc. Quote Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Friday, Oct 13, before the markets open. With a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.66%, the chances of the bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter is less.Similar to other big banks, the company expects trading revenues to decline. Its chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio projected that the bank’s earnings in the quarter will be hit by a decline in trading income (down roughly 15% from the prior-year quarter). However, net interest income is expected to rise driven by modest growth in loans and deposits, partially offset by the adverse impact from the sale of non-U.S. consumer credit card operation.Bank of America outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation Quote On Friday, yet another big bank, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), is also slated to announce results. With a Zacks Rank #4 and Earnings ESP of +0.03%, the chances of earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter is less.Mounting expenses (mainly due to elevated technology costs) and continual auto loan portfolio runoff are expected to dent the results. Also, litigation costs/provisions are projected to remain high as the bank continues to face accusations related to its sales practices. However, Wells Fargo will likely benefit from easing margin, loan growth and seasonally higher mortgage banking income to some extent.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise  Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company Quote Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2480,WFC,"So far, small-cap stocks and related ETFs like iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM  -  Free Report) were meant to provide true domestic exposure. Since small-cap stocks are less exposed to foreign markets, these are less scathed by a stronger greenback and economic upheaval abroad (read: Behind the Incredible 5-Year Run of Small Cap ETFs).However, iShares recently launched a fund, iShares Russell 1000 Pure U.S. Revenue ETF (AMCA  -  Free Report), which is large-cap in nature but includes stocks that derive 85% or more of their sales from the United States and is a good replication of domestic economic health.Inside AMCAThe fund tracks the performance of U.S. companies exhibiting higher domestic sales as a proportion of the company’s total sales relative to other large- and mid-capitalization U.S. equities, as per the issuer. All companies on the Russell 1000 Index with a domestic sales ratio of 90% or greater will get a chance to be included in the underlying index.The ETF comprises 423 stocks with top holdings including AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report),  Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), having shares of 3.65%, 3.40% and 3.30%, respectively. The fund is highly concentrated on its top 10 holdings, which account for about 28.49% of the assets (read: Why You Should Bet on Blue Chip ETFs Now). As far as sector allocation is concerned, Financials (24.1%), Consumer Discretionary (15.4%) and Utilities (10.5%) hold the top three spots in the fund. It is light on the technology, energy, industrials and consumer staples sectors. The fund charges 15 bps in fees from investors per year.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?Investors should note that sales are harder to influence in an income statement than earnings. A company can land up on decent earnings numbers by adopting cost-cutting or some other measures that do not speak for its core strength. But it is harder for a company to mold its revenue figure. So, the revenue figure is extremely important in judging a company’s health. Notably, the Q2 earnings season is in its tail end. Growth appears slightly weaker than the prior period, but beat ratios have emerged stronger, especially on the top line. This makes it important to have a look at the revenue-weighted products (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Moreover, U.S.-focused companies will cushion the fund against macroeconomic upheaval and negative currency translation.ETF Competition The newly launched ETF is less likely to face stiff competition thanks to conceptual novelty. The fund will not just revolve around revenues, it will target companies fetching more revenues from the United States.However, the newbie may find Oppenheimer Large Cap Fund (RWL  -  Free Report) as its peer. The underlying index of RWL is created by “re-weighting the constituent securities of the S&P 500 Index according to the revenue earned by the companies in the S&P 500 Index” (read: Earnings or Revenue-Weighted ETFs: Finding the Q2 Winner).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2481,WFC,"Per a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) merchant services division has been accused of charging small business with unacceptable fees for credit card transactions. Also, the bank has been alleged to have charged excessively high fees for early termination.The lawsuit claims that the bank used a 63-pages long contract written in ""deceptive language"" in order to confuse the small business owners.This time Wells Fargo Merchant Services has come under the limelight, which is a joint venture between Wells Fargo and First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report).CNNMoney cited a former employee of the bank’s Merchant Services division, who claimed to have been instructed to target small business with no legal support. He disclosed that during his two-year tenure at the bank, it was impossible for the owners to exit the agreement.Among the plaintiffs, Queen City Tours claimed that the bank charged it monthly fees of $20 to $35 for not being able to conduct minimum number of transactions, when it was specified in the contract that there would be no such fees. Further, the tour company also accused the bank of levying an early termination fees of about $500.Another plaintiff, Patti's Pitas, a Pennsylvania-based restaurant, claimed that is was charged very high fees when it went out of business. Wells Fargo argued that Patti's Pitas could not break the three-year term of the contract. However, the restaurant owner was not aware of the term.Wells Fargo, however, denied all allegations. Further, the bank believes that the negotiated pricing terms were fair and had been administered well.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the same space worth considering are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).Carolina Financial witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 4.5% for the current year, over the last 30 days. Its share price has increased 51.8% in the past year.BNY Mellon’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings have been revised nearly 1% upward in the last 30 days. The company’s share price has increased almost 30% in a year.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

2482,WFC,"Monday, October 9, 2017In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors. In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun.

2484,WFC,"People's United Financial Inc.’s (PBCT  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 operating earnings of 24 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure was up 4% year over year.Higher revenues and lower provisions primarily led to the earnings growth. Growth in loans and deposit further supported the results. However, the rise in expenses and decline in profitability ratios were the undermining factors.Net income came in at $69.3 million or 19 cents per share compared with $68.5 million or 23 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Revenues Rise but So Do ExpensesNet revenue, on a fully taxable basis, was up 13% year over year to $376.8 million in the quarter.Net interest income, on a fully taxable basis, totaled $285.2 million, up 15.1% year over year. Further, net interest margin improved 9 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.90%.Non-interest income climbed 7.3% year over year to $91.6 million. The rise was primarily attributable to higher investment management fees, commercial banking lending fees, operating lease income and insurance revenue.Non-interest expenses increased 21% on a year-over-year basis to $257.3 million. Rise in compensation and benefits, professional and outside services, regulatory assessments and other non-interest expenses were the main factors responsible for the significant increase in expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $31.6 billion, up 6.4% from the prior quarter. Further, total deposits increased approximately 4.3% to $31.8 billion from the prior quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $198.1 million, up 8.8% year over year. Ratio of non-performing loans to total originated loans increased 4 bps from the prior year quarter to 0.60%.However, net loan charge-offs decreased 4% year over year to $4.9 million and provision for loan losses was $7.8 million, down 25.7% year over year.Capital Position Strengthens, Profitability Ratios DeclineCapital ratios of People’s United displayed improvement. As of Jun 30, 2017, total risk-based capital ratio climbed to 12.6% from 11.5% in the year-ago quarter. Further, tangible equity ratio was 7.5%, up from 7.2% in the year-ago quarter.The company’s profitability ratios deteriorated. Return on average tangible stockholders’ equity was 8.7%, down from 10.1% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average assets of 0.65% was down from 0.70% in the year-ago quarter.Our ViewpointPeople’s United reported a decent quarter with healthy organic growth. Furthermore, the company is steadily growing through acquisitions, which is likely to continue in the near future, given its strong balance sheet position. Also, a likely ease of regulatory restrictions might bring down costs on this front.However, margin pressure and rising non-interest expenses are expected to restrict bottom-line expansion in the upcoming quarters. People's United Financial, Inc.

2485,WFC,"Regions Financial Corporation’s (RF  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings from continuing operations of 25 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, the figure came in 25% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Impressive growth in revenues aided by easing margin pressure drove the better-than-expected results. Further, the quarter recorded growth in loans, though deposits balance remained stable. Credit quality metrics also improved. Rise in operating expenses and decline in non-interest income were the undermining factors.Income from continuing operations available to common shareholders was $301 million, up 17.6% year over year.Revenue Improves, Costs UpAdjusted total revenue (net of interest expense) came in at $1.42 billion in the quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Net interest margin (on an FTE basis) expanded 17 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.32% in the quarter. Elevated market interest rates and favorable credit-related interest recoveries drove the results. These increases were partially offset by reduced average loan balances.Regions Financial reported slight decline in non-interest income to come in at $525 million. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income remained stable year over year.Non-interest expense edged down around 1% year over year to $909 million. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses rose 1.1% year over year to $899 million. An increase in salaries and benefits, FDIC insurance assessments, professional, legal and regulatory, along with furniture and equipment expenses, led to the rise. These were mostly mitigated by reduced provision for unfunded credit losses, marketing and other real estate expenses.Balance Sheet StrengthAs of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were down 2.3% year over year to $80.1 billion. Further, total deposits came in at $97.5 billion, almost stable year over year. Total funding costs were 34 basis points (bps).As of Jun 30, 2017, low-cost deposits, as a percentage of average deposits, were 93.0% compared with 92.5% as of Jun 30, 2016. In addition, deposit costs came in at 15 bps in the reported quarter.Credit Quality ImprovedNon-performing assets, as a percentage of loans, foreclosed properties and non-performing loans held for sale, contracted 26 bps from the prior-year quarter to 1.14%. Also, non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, as a percentage of loans, came in at 1.03%, down 22 bps from the year-ago quarter.Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans, net of unearned income was 1.30%, down 11 bps from the year-earlier quarter. In addition, provision for loan losses was $48 million, plunging 33.3% year over year.  Additionally, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans came in at 0.34%, down 1 bp. The company’s total business services criticized loans declined 10.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionRegions Financial’s estimated ratios remained well above the regulatory requirements under the Basel III capital rules. As of Jun 30, 2017, Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) and Tier 1 capital ratio were estimated at 11.3% and 12.2%, respectively, compared to 10.8% and 11.7% in the prior-year quarter.During second-quarter 2017, Regions Financial repurchased 9.1 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $125 million and announced $84 million in dividends to common shareholders.

2487,WFC,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q2 earnings releases. The going is good so far, with five big banks crushing estimates on both lines and Wells Fargo beating on earnings but missing on revenues.The Zacks Sector Rank for some top banks is in the top 19%. However, the downtrend in the benchmark U.S. Treasury yields in recent times thanks to a dovish Fed rate hike outlook and geopolitical risks are concern for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at banking earnings in detail:Big Bank Earnings in FocusRising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings to $1.82 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. Also, the figure reflects a 17% rise from the year-ago period. Managed net revenue of $26.4 billion was up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.8 billion. An 8% jump in interest income spurred by rising rates and an advancement in the number of loans facilitated revenue improvement.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) reported 2% year-over-year expansion in revenues to $17.9 billion helped by the retail division and investment banking. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.3 billion. The company’s income from continuing operations per share of $1.27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.9% in the second quarter. Earnings of $1.07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.01 per share. The quarter’s total revenue was $22.2 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion but in line with the prior-year quarter figure. Wells Fargo witnessed a slump in car loans and tighter lending standards hurt the segment, going by article published on BBC News. Lending was also stagnant.Driven by increase in net revenues in equity securities, The Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) reported earnings per share of $3.95 in the second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36. Further, the bottom line witnessed 6% year-over-year improvement. Goldman’s net revenue edged down 1% year over year to $7.89 billion in the quarter under review. However, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.57 billion.However, lower fixed income revenues were a drag. Goldman’s FICC trading recorded its lowest revenue in any single quarter since 2008. Institutional Client Services division and Investment Banking division suffered in the quarter.Higher investment banking fees as well as loan growth can be attributed to Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.46 per share. The figure was 12% higher than the prior-year quarter. Net revenue amounted to $23.1 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.9 billion. Loan growth supported revenues.Continued strength in equity trading drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.87 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76. The reported figure was 16% above the prior-year quarter. Net revenue amounted to $9.5 billion, reflecting a rise of 7% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.3 billion.Market Impact Investors, who still have their hopes pinned on an upbeat earnings season, Trump’s promises for deregulation and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) responded to the earnings releases. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (see all Financial ETFs here).Most of these ETFs slipped in the last five days (as of July 17, 2017) – in the peak of the earnings season. Only IYF and IAI logged modest gains of about 0.5% each in the last five days (as of July 17, 2017) (read: Strong ETF Inflows Boost BlackRock Earnings).What Led to the Underperformance Despite Beat?The yield on the 10-year note are on a declining mode thanks to political uncertainty and some downbeat economic numbers. This once again stirred speculation over whether the Fed will be able to enact one more rate hike this year, which is likely to weigh on banks’ future net interest income (read: Why Bank ETFs Fell on Friday Despite Decent Earnings?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

2488,WFC,"It’s time for full-fledged releases of quarterly earnings. Big banks will start reporting from this week. Let’s dig deeper into the likely earnings picture of the big six banking companies that could drive the performance of the sector ahead (read: Buy These ETFs & Stocks as Q3 Earnings Unfold).According to our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Inside Our Surprise PredictionAmong the big six, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) are likely to report on Oct 12. JPM has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.53%. This lowers the predictive power of ESP because a favorable Zacks Rank when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. The stock has a VGM Style Score of D and a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 38%.The same is the surprise prediction for Citigroup. Despite a Zacks Rank #3, an ESP of -0.29%, a VGM Style Score of F and a Zacks Industry Rank of bottom 38% spell trouble for the stock.On Oct 13,Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and an ESP of +0.03%, will report earnings results. This once again makes chances of an earnings beat poor.Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is expected to report on Oct 13 before the market opens. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -0.66%. Needless to say, here also, surprise prediction is tough. WFC and BAC have a VGM Score of D and F, respectively. Plus, the Zacks Industry Rank of both is in the bottom 8%.On Oct 17, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) are likely to come up with their earnings releases. Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP of -1.46%. While the earnings beat is difficult to predict, a VGM Score of B and a Zacks Industry Rank of top 23% are positives about the stock.Goldman has a Zacks Rank #3, a VGM Score of F and an ESP of 0.00%.The stock’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, doesn’t make it a sure-shot candidate for an earnings beat. But the stock’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 23%.What Does ESP Tell About Bank ETFs? As discussed above, chances of a broad-based earnings beat are anything but high.Total Q3 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry are expected to decline 5.1% from the same period last year on 2.2% higher revenues, as per the Earnings Trends.It is the Fed and Trump who can save the sector. The Fed in the form of policy tightening and consequent higher yields and Trump in the form of likely tax cuts may benefit the space.Notably, since banks' effective tax rates hover in a range as high as 25-35%, these are likely to benefit more from the tax reform plan, as per analysts (read: Best ETF Strategies for a Hawkish Fed).Market Impact Still, investors pinning their hopes on a moderate earnings season, Trump’s promises for deregulation and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report) (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) (VFH  -  Free Report) are performing before the earnings releases. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (see all Financial ETFs here).Goldman has moderate exposure in the aforementioned ETFs, rather it is heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report). All these ETFs were in line with the S&P 500-based ETF SPY in the last five days (as of Oct 9, 2017) (read: 5 Winning ETF Strategies for Q4).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2489,WFC,"It’s been an interesting few days around the global markets, but investors are still eagerly anticipating the slew of earnings reports coming from the big banks later this week. Of these, we can almost guarantee that investment and consumer banking behemoth Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results will be an important bellwether for the rest of the financial sector.With shares up about 27% year-to-date, Citigroup has emerged as one of the most compelling stocks in the financial sector. On top of that, excitement over the GOP’s proposed tax cuts and anticipation for another rate hike in December has sparked positive momentum throughout the banking industry.(For more on the banking industry as a whole, check out our expanded earning preview: Bank Stocks Earnings Preview: What To Expect From BAC, JPM, C, & WFC)Today, we’ll be taking a closer look at Citigroup and what types of results investors should expect to see in its key categories this quarter. By using our Zacks Consensus Estimates, as well as our exclusive non-financial metrics file, we’ve found three important things to note ahead of Citigroup’s report.Check them out: Earnings:Based on the latest Zacks Consensus Estimate, we expect to see Citigroup report earnings of $1.30 per share. This would represent growth of 4% from the $1.25 per share posted in the year-ago quarter. The biggest potential headwind for this quarter will be weak trading revenues, as lower volatility around the world has likely led to a slow quarter in this unit. However, recent restructuring and streamlining initiatives should support profitability.Efficiency Ratio:The efficiency ratio is always an important measure of bank productivity. In short, it is a way to gauge the cost required to generate one dollar of revenue. According to our consensus estimates, Citigroup’s efficiency ratio is expected to come in at 57.4% this quarter. That would mark an improvement from the 59% ratio posted in the previous quarter, further signaling that the company’s expense management efforts have been successful.Total Provisions For Credit Losses:Based on our consensus estimates, we expect to see Citigroup report total provisions for credit losses in the area of $1.855 billion. This is up from $1.717 billion in the previous quarter and $1.736 in the year-ago period. Remember, while this is an estimation of potential losses due to defaulted credit, it is treated as an expense on the company’s balance sheet. With provisions rising, Citigroup will need to support earnings somewhere else.Some of these consensus estimates are pulled from our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2491,WFC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Wells Fargo Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates, Costs Flare UpHigher interest income drove Wells Fargo & Company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings which recorded a positive surprise of 4.9%. Earnings of $1.07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.01 per share.Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances. Higher net interest income was also favorable. In addition, a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key positives. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside.Notably, reserve release of $100 million was recorded in the reported quarter, driven by strong credit performance. Second-quarter net income came in at $5.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion in the prior-year quarter.The quarter’s total revenue was $22.2 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion. Revenues were in line with the prior-year quarter figure.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, revenue generation at the business segments was impressive. Community Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments’ total quarterly revenue increased around 1.0% and 7.7%, respectively, while Wholesale Banking revenues declined around 4.5%.Loans and Deposits & Interest Income Rise, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.5 billion, up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities, loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin expanded 4 basis points year over year to 2.90%, reflecting a rising interest rate environment.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 7% year over year, primarily due to low mortgage banking revenue, lower net gains from trading activities and debt securities, along with reduced other income.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $957.4 billion, up slightly year over year. Growth in commercial loan portfolio contributed to the rise, partially offset by reduction in consumer loan portfolio. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, up 4.8% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $13.5 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from higher FDIC and other deposit assessments, as well as elevated other and employee benefits and salaries expenses.The company’s efficiency ratio of 61.1% was above 58.1% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, down 4.7% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $555 million, plunging 48.3% year over year. Net charge-offs were $655 million or 0.27% of average loans in the reported quarter, down 29.1% from the year-ago quarter net charge-offs of $924 million (0.39%). Non-performing assets were down 25.2% to $9.8 billion in the quarter under review from $13.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the reported quarter, the company repurchased 43 million shares of common stock.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $151.9 billion from $145.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.6% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 10.6% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share increased to $36.53 from $35.38 in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported decent revenue numbers and we expect top-line headwinds to subside, given the improving interest rate environment. However, escalating expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business.Cross-selling, which has been the company’s major strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of bank employees were unlawfully enrolling consumers for products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting the sales targets. The bank has also been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Nevertheless, we believe that over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also believe that strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to six lower.Wells Fargo & Company Price and Consensus  Wells Fargo & Company Price and Consensus | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Wells Fargo's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, though it is doing a lot better on the momentum front with a B. The stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum and value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

2492,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. Investors’ optimism on the overall second-quarter earnings performance of the industry has been faded by concerns related to the North Korean.The three major equity benchmarks — Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq — recorded the worst session on Thursday since mid-May.

The venture, known as Wells Fargo Merchant Services, was formed to help small businesses and other merchants across the country to process their credit and debit card transactions. It had promised to provide a transparent pricing policy to the merchants.However, per the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn, on behalf of Patti's Pitas, a now-closed restaurant in Pennsylvania, tour operator Queen City Tours in Charlotte, NC, and other merchants, the venture failed to live up to its promises. It was overbilling merchants for its services and was charging them with unanticipated fees, which they were claiming to be ‘interchange charges.’ The venture claimed that the fee was being charged by some credit card network, but actually it was them who were making profit out of the same.

2493,WFC,"Fresh rhetoric on North Korea ruined market gains on Tuesday as the Dow’s record run of wins finally came to a close. Despite the day’s gyrations between loss and advances, trading retained a muted tone, with the S&P 500 losing only 0.2% to end near session lows.Such a finish was in keeping with the market’s mood over most of the year, with the broadest benchmark hovering within an extremely narrow corridor. And despite losing out on early gains to end the day 0.2% lower, financials may hold the key to gains in the days ahead. A variety of factors have investors rooting for the group and you would be missing out on some neat profits if you don't pick up these five great financials picks. Trading Within a Tight BandBy all accounts, this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965. One estimate puts the current level of volatility at the lowest in 52 years. Since Jul 19, the S&P 500 has not gained or lost 0.5% over a single session. In fact, the index has swung 1% either way only four times year to date. The only exception to such placid behavior has been the Nasdaq, which has moved 1% over 11 trading days.To put things in perspective, the market’s so called “fear gauge”, the VIX, continues to linger near its lowest point in 23 years and more. The popular measure of market volatility had plummeted to this level on May 8, within striking distance of where the market stands. Of course, this has translated into strong gains for the average investor, with the S&P 500 up more than 9% year to date.Not just that, indexes have continued to notch up record levels during this abnormally quiet stretch of trading. The calm has been broken only seldom, primarily by the valuation fears which stalked tech stocks before their fabulous second-quarter results.Could a Dip be Around the Corner?But growing voices within the investment community believe that such a state of affairs might not last long. Even as friction with North Korea rises, central banks across the world are taking a hawkish stance on monetary policy. Meanwhile, there are growing signs that the projected step up in GDP, to 3%, is unlikely to happen during a likely lackluster second half. This is another reason why upside has been limited for stocks till now this year as investors continue to steel themselves for the drop that is likely to come sooner or later.Even as the future looks uncertain for markets, investors are becoming increasingly partial to a few select sectors and to financials in particular. According to Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), this is one of the sectors presently positioned “for the biggest outperformance.""Why Financials are Set to WinA bunch of fundamental and technical factors have been working in the sector’s favor. Investment firm Oppenheimer has underlined the fact that finance has remained the leading sector in terms of performance since May, even as interest rates plummeted and Treasury yields touched peak levels. Strong performance in the face of such adverse conditions was a sign that downsides had been priced in and the sector was set to rally, the firm said.Additionally, the sector remains relatively undervalued at a time when prospects of further deregulation look bright. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) strongly believes share buybacks and dividends for the sector are likely to rise thrice as much as that of the S&P 500. Further, the investment bank thinks even though finance has gained more than 30% over the last year, emerging as the best performing sector, room for further upside still exist.Our ChoicesStocks have traded within a narrow channel so far this year, continuing to create multiple milestones. But such tight trading hints at futher downside. In such a scenario, a few favored sectors have emerged and finance is likely the most promising of them all.Picking financials, the leading performer over the last one-year period, will help you reap rich profits even in the near term.

2494,WFC,"U.S. stocks continue to extend their winning streak with the S&P 500 carving its sixth straight record close on Oct 5, the longest since June 1997. The market value-weighted index also completed its eight-day long winning streak, the longest since 2013. The broad index has posted its 43rd record close in 2017 so far and is up 350% from the low hit in March 2009. In fact, the index has more than doubled in the decade ever since its pre-crisis peak of October 2007.So, what has driven the S&P 500 higher? Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution. Renewed optimism over tax cuts propelled the buying of assets perceived as risky, including financial and tech stocks.Investors’ sentiments were also buoyed by narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and rebound in exports, which might boost the economy in the third quarter. The U.S. economy is already growing close to the range projected by the White House, while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in fundamentally sound stocks listed under the S&P 500 seems judicious.House Passes $4.1-Trillion BudgetThe House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much awaited tax code later this year. The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains $1.1 trillion in non-entitlement outlays, including nearly $622 billion for defense.The far-reaching plan will trim taxes for individuals as well as corporates. The tax plan aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%, while the corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. These tax reforms will put the economy in overdrive, which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above $20 trillion.Republicans’ major tax bill, known as budget reconciliation, required a simple majority in the Senate. The final tally was a narrow 219 to 206, with majority adopting the House of Representatives’ version of the budget.Financials and Technology Led Advancers in the S&P 500 Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Banking on such optimism, shares of banks scaled north.Among tech behemoths, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Oracle ORCL and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas. The tax plan seeks to encourage such multinationals to bring those profits back to the United States by cutting the tax rate. Shares of these companies scaled higher, with Netflix turning out to be the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, ending the day 5.4% higher at $194.39.Other sectors, including telecom, consumer staples and consumer discretionary, that tend to pay more to Uncle Sam also benefitted immensely.Investors Happy on Solid Economic DataThe U.S. international trade deficit fell by nearly $1 billion in August from July, while exports rose slightly to $128.9 billion in the month. This is quite encouraging as analysts had feared that hurricanes might affect trade data for August, with exports delayed due to storms.The U.S. GDP, in the meanwhile, expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States also scaled a 13-year high in September, while non-manufacturing activity picked up to a 12-year high. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. The non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month from 55.3% in the prior month.5 Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy NowWith the S&P 500 scaling record highs on tax cut hopes and a strengthening economy, investing in sound stocks from the index seems a prudent choice.

2495,WFC,"The financial sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately. With developments in President Donald Trump’s tax reform plan and odds of another rate hike to end this year increasing, financials stocks have been rallying.Cause for AppealRepublican leaders unveiled a tax reform plan aimed at reducing taxes for the corporate and also individuals. Although still in its early stages, it has increased investor optimism about hopes of tax cuts and deregulation (read: Treasury ETFs Weaken in the Wake of Tax Talk and Fed Chief Rumors).Moreover, in its latest September meeting, the Federal Reserve held on to rates. However, it hinted at chances of a rate hike in the December meeting. The current probability of a December rate hike of 25 basis points is 76.7%, per the CME Fed watch tool.Adding to the rally, the current favorite to lead the Fed, Kevin Warsh, is seen as a friend of the administration who is expected to expedite the process of deregulation and further rate hikes if he assumes the position currently held by Janet Yellen (see all Financials ETFs here).iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Financials Index. It has AUM of $1.98 billion and charges a moderate fee of 44 basis points a year.

The fund’s top three holdings are Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRK.B  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) with 7.1%, 6.7% and 5.0% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 29, 2017).  The fund has returned 26.3% in a year and 11.2% year to date (as of Oct 2, 2017). IYF currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Financials 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $6.5 billion and charges a fee of only 10 basis points a year.

The fund has returned 33.6% in a year and 11.0% year to date (as of Oct 2, 2017). VFH currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineVFH is more popular than IYF, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, it also may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  It also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, both the funds have had relatively similar year to date performance. IYF returned a mere 0.2% more than VFH so far this year whereas in a year, VFH clearly outperformed IYF. With growing developments in the sector, these ETFs are poised to offer great growth potential. However, since the factors driving growth in this sector is still in its early stages, a better-ranked ETF like VFH might help alleviate some of the political uncertainties prevailing in the region.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2496,WFC,"BancorpSouth, Inc.’s (BXS  -  Free Report) adjusted operating earnings in second-quarter 2017 came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Moreover, the company compared favorably with the year-ago quarter tally of 39 cents. Revenues escalated aided by strong loans and deposits balances. Further, stable non-interest expenses were a positive. However, decreased mortgage lending revenues were a major drag.Including mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) valuation adjustment of $1.5 million, the company’s second-quarter net income amounted to $37.9 million or 41 cents per share, down from $34.7 million or 37 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues, Loans and Deposits Escalate, Costs StableBancorpSouth’s second-quarter net revenue increased 2.7% year over year to $185.6 million. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $187.8 million.Net interest revenue amounted to $117.5 million, up 4.6% year over year. Fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.52%, down 4 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter figure on high average cost of deposits.Non-interest revenues dipped slightly year over year to $68.1 million. The decline was mainly due to a drop in mortgage banking revenues and deposit service charges. These decreases were partially offset by high insurance commissions and other income.Excluding the MSR valuation adjustments, mortgage banking revenues totaled $7.6 million, down 36.7% from $12.0 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses remained stable at $127.6 million on a year-over-year basis.As of Jun 30, 2017, total deposits were $11.9 billion, up 4.4% year over year, while net loans and leases rose 3.8% to $11.0 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagBancorpSouth’s credit quality displayed a mixed picture. The company recorded $1.0 million of provisions in the reported quarter compared with $2 million in year-ago quarter. Non-performing loans and leases decreased to $71.7 million or 0.65% of net loans and leases as of Jun 30, 2017, from $80.2 million or 0.76% as of Jun 30, 2016.Additionally, allowance for credit losses to net loans and leases edged down to 1.10% from 1.20% recorded in the comparable period last year. Also, non-performing assets were $79.4 million, down 16.3% year over year.However, annualized net charge-offs, as a percent of average loans and leases were 0.17% compared with annualized 0.06% in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionBancorpSouth remained well capitalized during the second quarter. As of Jun 30, 2017, Tier I capital and tier I leverage capital was 11.90% and 9.93%, while it was 12.37% and 10.66%, respectively, at the end of the prior-year quarter.The ratio of its total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.40% at the end of the quarter, down from 12.12% as of Jun 30, 2016. The ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets contracted 67 bps to 9.44%.During the second quarter, the company repurchased 1.38 million common shares at an average price of $29.64 per share.Our ViewpointWe believe BancorpSouth is well poised to expand through strategic acquisitions, backed by a strong capital and liquidity position. In addition, gradual economic recovery is likely to boost the company’s top-line performance, highlighting its organic prospects. However, decline in mortgage banking revenues is a matter of concern. BancorpSouth, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BancorpSouth, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BancorpSouth, Inc.

Earnings per share of 97 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.

This resulted from improvement in earning asset composition and the favorable impact of increased interest rates on loan yields.Texas Capital’s non-interest income surged 35.3% year over year to $18.8 million. The rise was primarily due to an increase in service charges, servicing income, wealth management and trust fee income, along with other income.However, non-interest expenses increased 18.6% year over year to $111.8 million. This was mainly stemmed by rise in almost all components of expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans rose 13% year over year to $20.3 billion, while deposits climbed 3.6% year over year to $17.3 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets totaled 0.73% of the loan portfolio plus other real estate owned assets, reflecting a year-over-year contraction of 31 basis points.

2498,WFC,"Continued strength in equity trading drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 87 cents per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. The reported figure was 16% above the prior-year quarter.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained nearly 4% in early market trading, largely driven by impressive growth in equity trading income and investment banking. The stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Higher underwriting fees, growth in equity trading income and stable advisory fees were primarily responsible for the significant improvement in earnings. Also, the company’s capital ratios remained strong.However as expected, fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) income declined. Further, lower net interest income (owing to a fall in corporate loans) and a rise in operating expenses acted as headwinds.Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.8 billion, up 11% year over year.Equity Trading Improvement Supports Revenues, Costs RiseNet revenue amounted to $9.5 billion, a rise of 7% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.3 billion.Net interest income was $751 million, down 18% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely due to a drastic rise in interest expenses. However, total non-interest revenues of $8.8 billion grew 7% year over year, primarily supported by improvement in trading and investments.Total non-interest expenses were $6.9 billion, up 7% year over year. The rise was due to a 6% increase in compensation and benefits costs as well as 29% jump in other expenses.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion, down 4% year over year. Net revenue of $4.8 billion rose 4% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly driven by a significant increase in underwriting income and equity trading revenues as well as stable advisory income, partially offset by decline in FICC income.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, a jump of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue was $4.2 billion, up 9% year over year, driven by higher asset management fee revenues and net interest income, partly offset by a fall in transactional revenues.Investment Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $142 million, jumping 20% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue was $665 million, a rise of 14% year over year. The increase reflected higher investment revenues and asset management fees.As of Jun 30, 2017, total assets under management or supervision were $435 billion, up 7% on a year-over-year basis.Strong Capital PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, book value per share was $38.22, up from $36.29 as of Jun 30, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $33.24, up from $31.39 as of Jun 30, 2016.Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 capital ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 18.9%, up from 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 common equity ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 16.6% compared with 16.8% in the prior-year quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley bought back around 12 million shares for nearly $500 million. This was part of the company's 2016 capital plan.Dividend HikeAs part of its 2017 capital plan, Morgan Stanley announced quarterly dividend of 25 cents. This represents a 25% hike from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Aug 15 to shareholder of record as of Jul 31.Our TakeMorgan Stanley’s initiatives to offload its non-core assets, in order to lower balance-sheet risks and shift focus toward less capital-incentive operations are commendable. However, continued decline in interest income despite an improving rate scenario remains a near-term concern. Also, decline in bond trading fees owing to low client activity is an issue.Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteCurrently, Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other banking giants, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

2499,WFC,"Impacted by low non-interest income and high expenses, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.8% in second-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.18, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. However, the reported figure compared favorably with $1.07 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Escalating operating expenses and fall in non-interest income were recorded. However, top-line growth aided by higher net interest income and credit provisions was positives. In addition, the quarter witnessed a rise in assets under custody, as well assets under management.Net income came in at $267.9 million or $1.12 per share compared with $263 million or $1.10 recorded in the prior-year quarter. Results include certain one-time items.Margins Improve, Non-interest Income Falls, Costs EscalateTotal revenue of $1.33 billion was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported figure was slightly up year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $350.4 million was up 14% year over year. This was driven by increased levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin (NIM) was 1.28%, up 12 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates and reduced premium amortization. The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable mix shift in earning assets.Non-interest income declined 4% from the year-ago quarter to $979.7 million. Fall in foreign exchange trading income, other operating income and treasury management fees were the primary reasons for this decrease. These were partially offset by elevated trust, investment, along with rise in security commissions and trading income.Non-interest expenses were up 1% year over year to $937.4 million in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an elevation in mostly all components of expenses.Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Jun 30, 2017, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody increased 16% year over year to $7.38 trillion, while total assets under management rose 14% to $1.03 trillion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $178.8 million, down 21% year over year. Net charge-offs were $3.2 million, up 33% from the year-ago quarter figure. Also, credit provision was $7.0 million in the quarter compared with $3.0 million in the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets increased slightly year over year to $166.7 million as of Jun 30, 2017.  Strong Capital PositionUnder the Advanced Approach, as of Jun 30, 2017, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio were 14.5%, 16.5% and 8.1% respectively, each exceeding the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment ActivitiesDuring second-quarter 2017, Northern Trust repurchased 1.76 million shares for $157.6 million at an average price of $89.52 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.Recently, Northern Trust announced a quarterly cash dividend of 42 cents per share on common stock, indicating an increase of 10.5% over the prior dividend of 38 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Oct 1 to holders as of Sep 1, 2017.The company’s board of directors also approved a new common stock repurchase authorization of up to 9.5 million shares, replacing the authorization approved in Apr 2015.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the consistent growth in assets under custody, revenues and an improving credit quality to some extent. Moreover, positive impact of rising rates was visible. Though increase in expenses and lower non-interest income might pose a threat to the company’s profitability, anticipated lesser regulations might act as a tailwind.Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteCurrently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2500,WFC,"Driven by high net interest income, U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) reported a positive surprise of 1.2% in second-quarter 2017. The company reported earnings per share of 85 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Results also came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 83 cents.Also, shares of U.S. Bancorp gained more than 2% in the pre-market session, indicating that investors have been bullish on the results. The price reaction during the full trading session will give a fair idea about the extent of satisfaction among investors.Rising interest-rate environment aided the bank’s interest income. Further, elevated average loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. Steady capital deployment activities reflected a strong capital position. However, escalating expenses and provisions were undermining factors.Net income was $1.5 billion, down 1.4% year over year.Revenue, Loans & Deposits Growth Recorded, Costs & Provisions EscalateU.S. Bancorp’s net revenue came in at around $5.49 billion in the quarter, up around 1% year over year. The increase in net interest income was mostly offset by lower non-interest income. Moreover, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.46 billion.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 5.9% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates.Average earning assets climbed 4.8% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average cash balances. Further, net interest margin of 3.04% was up 2 basis points year over year, driven by higher interest rates. Loan portfolio mix, reduced reinvestment rates on maturing securities and elevated cash balances partially mitigated rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income moved down 5.2% on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial products revenue, mortgage banking revenue and other non-interest income.Provision for credit losses increased 7.0% year over year to $350 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans increased 3.4% year over year to $275.5 billion. The growth was stemmed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, total other retail and credit card loans. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate and covered loans. Excluding covered loans, average total loans rose 3.7% year over year.Average total deposits were up 7.7% from the prior-year quarter to $331.2 billion. The upsurge was due to growth in non-interest-bearing deposits, as well as interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 1.0% year over year to $3.0 billion at U.S. Bancorp. The upsurge in mostly all components of non-interest expenses was partially offset by lower employee benefits and other intangibles.Deteriorating Credit QualityCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $340 million, up 7.3% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment.Total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, slightly up on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets (excluding covered assets) were $1.3 billion, down 23.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position. Effective Jan 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements for the company comply with Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by Jan 1, 2018.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 11.1%, in line with the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.3% as of Jun 30, 2017, in line with the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of “well-capitalized” requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.7% as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 12.0% as of Jun 30, 2016.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.5% as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 7.6% as of Jun 30, 2016.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $25.55 as of Jun 30, 2017, from $24.37 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the second quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 81% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks. It surpassed the high end of the company’s long-term goal of returning 60–80% to its shareholders.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted an impressive quarter. Along with higher revenues, a solid capital position and increased lending activities were added advantages. The company follows a conservative growth stratagem and has made small but strategic acquisitions.However, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses, along with provisions, remain headwinds.U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2501,WFC,"Financial stocks suffered sell-offs on Friday despite upbeat earnings. Bellwethers like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) missed revenue estimates but beat on earnings (read: De-Stress Your Portfolio by Betting on Bank ETFs).Though there were positive attributes like loan growth and improving net interest spread, the decline in U.S. Treasury yields weighed on the sector. Added to this, a somewhat subdued outlook provided by a few industry leaders led to Friday’s fall in banking shares.Decline in YieldsThe yield on the 10-year note dropped five basis points to 2.298% on July 14 on downbeat inflation number and retail sales data. This once again stirred speculation over whether the Fed will be able to enact one more rate hike this year. In any case, dovish remarks from Fed chief Yellen kept Treasury yields at check (read: Dovish Yellen Testimony to Boost These ETFs).The Fed chair has full faith in the U.S. economic growth momentum with a solid labor market, though she remains cautious about subdued inflation and wage growth. Yellen indicated that since the neutral rate – at which economic growth matches its potential and inflation – “is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance.""Inside Doubtfulness Tied to the Outlook J.P Morgan expects net interest income to grow by $4 billion this year, down from the prior guidance of $4.5 billion, due to a combination of mortgage adjustments, weakness in markets-related income, and an unexpected slump in 10-year bond yields, as per an article published on Reuters. Shares of JPM were down 0.9% on July 14.Reuters went on to explain that Citi Group depends less on deposits from consumers, who have not required higher rates as fast as institutional customers. Notably, a huge portion of Citigroup’s loan growth originated from credit cards which are devoid of balances and thus do “not earn interest from those loans.” Shares of Citigroup lost about 0.5% on July 14.Wells Fargo benefited from higher interest rates but “stagnant lending and weaker revenue in areas like mortgage banking” were concerns. Wells Fargo witnessed a slump in car loans and tighter lending standards hurt the segment, going by article published on BBC News. WFC lost about 1.1% on July 14.PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) also came up with an impressive scorecard but dampened analysts’ mood as it did not beef up its guidance. The stock shed over 0.1% on July 14.Banking ETFs’ PerformanceThe largest financial ETF Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report) lost over 0.4% on July 14. Banking ETFs like SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF(KRE  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF ((IAT  -  Free Report)), SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report) and First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund ((QABA  -  Free Report)) shed about 0.6%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively, on July 14 (see all financial ETFs).What Lies Ahead?Overall, the banking sector is on growth path. JP Morgan reported a 4.7% year-over-year increase in total net revenues to $26.4 billion for the second quarter of the year. An 8% jump in interest income spurred by rising rates and an advancement in the number of loans facilitated revenue improvement.There was also a double-digit uptick in J.P. Morgan’s card sales and merchant processing volumes. Citigroup reported 2% year-over-year expansion in revenues to $17.9 billion helped by the retail division and investment banking.Investors should note that major banks are expected to report about 4.5% earnings growth in the second quarter of 2017. Zacks Industry Rank for banks is still in the top 28%. Still, the interest rate is the key risk in the space, which is why the Zacks Sector Rank for banks is in the bottom 25%.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

2502,WFC,"Benchmarks finished at record highs on Friday as tech stocks gained. Tech has come a long way, evolving from the dot-com catastrophe to becoming a safety trade and are now favored by active managers. Investors are pouring money into Internet and tech companies, which are less vulnerable to tax cuts and changes in interest rates and are expected to benefit from lower corporate taxes, mainly on cash held overseas.Earnings season, meanwhile, kicked off. JP Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all posted better-than-expected earnings results, but, their shares fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic data on retail sales and inflation, which made market participants believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row, while the 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year. The Dow advanced 0.4% to close at 21,637.74. The S&P 500 also notched a record high, its first since June 19. The benchmark index rose 0.5% to finish at 2,459.27. The Nasdaq, however, finished slightly below its closing record of 6,321.76 set on June 8. The tech-heavy index gained 0.6% to close at 6,312.47.For the week, all the major indexes posted solid gains. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 1%, 1.4% and 2.6%, respectively. The indexes have overcome series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.Big Bank Earnings In a NutshellBanking-behemoths JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) handily beat earnings and revenue estimates, while Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations but modestly missed revenue estimates. A big reason for the market’s lukewarm reaction to the seemingly positive bank earnings is the soft guidance for the current period, particularly from JPMorgan. Also, signs of a slowdown in trading weighed on bank stocks (read more: Bank Earnings Are Good, But Fail to Impress).Soft economic data on retail sales and particularly the Consumer Price Index, furthermore, reduced the chances of additional rate hikes this year. This has dragged down Treasury yields, which has lowered the chances of increase in profits from one of the major profit centers for banks – interest income.Retail Sales Fizzle Out, Inflation was FlatSales at retailers fell 0.2% in June, marking the second straight drop and the biggest decline of the year. Most of the retail segments including gas stations, grocers, restaurants, book stores, sporting-goods stores and department stores saw a decline in sales figures. Such disappointing numbers indicated that the U.S. economy hasn’t rebounded strongly in the spring, which may give the Fed a reason to reassess how quickly it withdraws stimulus from the economy.The consumer-price-index, meanwhile, was unchanged last month. The index showed that the prices Americans pay for goods and services aren’t rising very much. In fact, the rate of inflation over the past 12 months has slowed down to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in the prior month.

2503,WFC,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.0% in second-quarter 2017, riding on higher revenues. The company’s income from continuing operations per share of $1.27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.25 per share.Despite earnings beat, investors were a bit disappointed on elevated costs of credit which led shares to decline around 0.45% to close at $66.72.Net income came in at $3.9 billion or $1.28 per share compared with $4.0 billion or $1.24 per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Overall revenues escalated, driven by higher banking revenues. However, expenses surged. Further, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the second quarter were up 22% year over year to $1.7 billion. The rise largely reflects net credit losses of $94 million and a net loan loss reserve release of $16 million.Higher Banking Revenues, Costs Flare UpRevenues increased 2% year over year to $17.9 billion in second-quarter 2017. The rise highlighted higher revenues in institutional clients group and global consumer banking, partially offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.3 billion.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.2 billion in the quarter, up 6% year over year. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 13%, partially offset by a 5% decline in total markets & securities services revenues on a year-over-year basis.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 5% year over year, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $653 million, plunging 45% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly reflected legacy assets runoff and divestiture activity.Operating expenses at Citigroup were slightly up year over year to $10.5 billion. Further, expenses elevated 2% (in constant dollars) on increased volume-related expenses, performance-based compensation and ongoing investments. These were mostly offset by efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.86 trillion, up 2% year over year. The company’s loans grew 2% year over year at $645 billion.

Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as expected potential ease of regulations under Donald Trump’s administration.However, several legal hassles remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc.

2505,WFC,"Higher investment banking fees as well as loan growth drove Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 46 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Results included $103 million of after-tax gains related to the sale of its non-U.S. consumer credit card business. The figure was 12% higher than the prior-year quarter. Nonetheless, markets don’t seem to be happy with BofA’s results. In  pre-market trading, the company’s shares were down nearly 1.1%. Sequential decline in net interest margin (owing to lower treasury yields during the quarter) and decline in mortgage banking fees were perhaps the reasons for the bearish stance. The price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better picture about how the investors accepted the results.Further, a slight rise in expenses and fall in trading revenues (as expected) acted as headwinds. However, increase in investment banking fees more than offset these and partially aided fee income growth during the quarter. The quarter witnessed modest loan growth, which helped in improving interest income. Additionally, provision for credit losses recorded a fall.Also, overall performance of the company’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments witnessed improvement in net income except Global Markets.Loan Growth Supports Revenue, Expenses Rise MarginallyNet revenue amounted to $23.1 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.9 billion.Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, grew 9% year over year to $11.2 billion. Further, net interest yield rose 11 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.34%.Also, non-interest income rose 6% from the year-ago quarter to $11.8 billion. The increase reflected higher investment banking fees, partially offset by decline in trading income and mortgage banking income.Non-interest expenses were $13.7 billion, up 2% year over year. The figure includes the impact of impairment charges related to certain data centers in process of being sold and higher severance.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Jun 30, 2017, ratio of nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties was 0.78%, down 20 bps year over year. Further, net charge-offs dropped 8% from the year-ago quarter to $908 million, indicating lower losses in consumer real estate.Also, provision for credit losses fell 26% year over year to $726 million, reflecting lower losses in consumer real estate and lower in energy exposures.Strong Capital PositionThe company’s book value per share as of Jun 30, 2017 was $24.88 compared with $23.71 as of Jun 30, 2016. Tangible book value per share as of Jun 30, 2017 was $17.78, up from $16.71 as of Jun 30, 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, the company’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio (Basel 3 Transition) was 11.5%.Our TakeImpressive performance in investment banking continued. BofA’s efforts to realign its balance sheet and focus on core operations will likely support bottom-line growth. Further, the bank is well positioned to benefit from higher interest rates.As expected, fixed income and equity trading declined. Further as interest rates move higher, mortgage refinancing is expected to continue falling.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteCurrently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, results were supported by a fall in provision for credit losses, rise in investment banking fees, loan growth and higher interest rates.

2506,WFC,"Higher interest income drove Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings which recorded a positive surprise of 4.9%. Earnings of $1.07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.01 per share.Shares of Wells Fargo decreased more than 2% in the pre-market session, indicating that investors have been bearish on the results. The price reaction during the full-trading session will give a fair idea about the extent of disappointment among investors.Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances. Higher net interest income was also favorable. In addition, a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key positives. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside.Notably, reserve release of $100 million was recorded in the reported quarter, driven by strong credit performance. Second-quarter net income came in at $5.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion in the prior-year quarter.The quarter’s total revenue was $22.2 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion. Revenues were in line with the prior-year quarter figure.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, revenue generation at the business segments was impressive. Community Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments’ total quarterly revenue increased around 1.0% and 7.7%, respectively, while Wholesale Banking revenues declined around 4.5%.Loans and Deposits & Interest Income Rise, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.5 billion, up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities, loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin expanded 4 basis points year over year to 2.90%, reflecting a rising interest rate environment.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 7% year over year, primarily due to low mortgage banking revenue, lower net gains from trading activities and debt securities, along with reduced other income.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $957.4 billion, up slightly year over year. Growth in commercial loan portfolio contributed to the rise, partially offset by reduction in consumer loan portfolio. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, up 4.8% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $13.5 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from higher FDIC and other deposit assessments, as well as elevated other and employee benefits and salaries expenses.The company’s efficiency ratio of 61.1% was above 58.1% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, down 4.7% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $555 million, plunging 48.3% year over year. Net charge-offs were $655 million or 0.27% of average loans in the reported quarter, down 29.1% from the year-ago quarter net charge-offs of $924 million (0.39%). Non-performing assets were down 25.2% to $9.8 billion in the quarter under review from $13.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the reported quarter, the company repurchased 43 million shares of common stock.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $151.9 billion from $145.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.6% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 10.6% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share increased to $36.53 from $35.38 in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported decent revenue numbers and we expect top-line headwinds to subside, given the improving interest rate environment. However, escalating expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business.Cross-selling, which has been the company’s major strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of bank employees were unlawfully enrolling consumers for products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting the sales targets. The bank has also been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Nevertheless, we believe that over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also believe that strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability.Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteCurrently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2507,WFC,"It’s finally here, and people like me now have something concrete to talk about: Q2 Earnings Season. It tends to be the quarter that least affects stocks and the market as a whole, based on the summer season and where it lays within the fiscal year: Q1 kicks off performance metrics for the full year, and Q3 brings them into the final stretch. Q4 is the final word. Q2 is… Q2.JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines, reporting $1.82 per share compared to the Zacks consensus of $1.57. Revenues of $26.4 billion topped expectations of $24.8 billion, as well as the year-ago number of $25.2 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon was quoted as saying the U.S. consumer remains healthy, but that without gridlock in Washington DC, his company would grow faster.JPM shared are trading down in the pre-market following the earnings announcement, which may speak to the “quality” of the beat. Certain aspects like a low loss provision in the quarter might be seen as temporary. But the company was boosted by lending, which illustrates financial market activity which we may see pop up elsewhere in the economy.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations as well, reporting $1.28 per share — 7 cents better than the Zacks consensus expectation of $1.21. Revenues of $17.90 billion also topped the consensus estimate of $17.32 billion, up 2% year over year. Healthier revenue streams were somewhat offset by higher costs of credit in the quarter. Like JPMorgan, Citigroup has a recent history of beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter. Pre-market shares are down slightly, however.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus, by 5 cents to $1.07 per share. Revenues, however, missed just slightly at $22.2 billion from the $22.3 billion expected. Pre-market shares of Wells Fargo are also down following the report; perhaps whatever good was expected by financial analysts has already been baked into the share price. Although market participants look to be in a relatively hesitant move at this hour, so perhaps we’re merely looking at the present mood of traders, subject to change.PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates as well this morning, posting a 9-cent beat to $2.10 per share. Revenues of $4.06 billion improved on the $4.00 billion expected, 7% greater than in the year-ago quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also trading down slightly in today’s pre-market.Keep in mind these banking majors are all up big from this time a year ago, 50+% in some cases (aside from Wells Fargo, which has had its internal issues about generating false accounts and its subsequent comeuppance from regulators; it is up only 16% year over year). So perhaps a “sell the news” scenario is in place for these companies on the first full day of Q2 earnings season, which is nothing to fear for longer-term market participants.Inflation Metrics MutedElsewhere, a new Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning for June in unchanged, slightly under analysts’ expectations. The core year-over-year read was 1.7%, about in-line with the modest gains expected in this inflation metric. A decline in energy prices (-2.8%) and airline fares (-2.7%) were notable in these latest monthly numbers.Retail Sales for June were also in negative territory: -0.2% on the headline, whereas analysts had been expecting a positive number. This follows a -0.3% read from May, meaning retailers have seen overall prices slip half of a full percentage point over the past two months. The drop in auto sales (-0.2%) are coming off tougher comps from a year ago, but we see broad-based weakness in retail pricing from last month.This is the sort of thing Janet Yellen and her cohorts at the Fed pay close attention to. We are not seeing inflation bubbling up in the economy as we had expected, especially in light of strong and consistent U.S. employment figures as of late. So while the pre-market appears cautious in trading right now, the mood may shift as it did during Yellen’s testimony a couple days ago: that factors indicate a lesser likelihood of raised interest rates in the near future, which may again spring market buying to new highs.

2508,WFC,"When the Federal Reserve had begun quantitative easing (QE) program in November 2008 and lowered the interest rates to near zero, the economy was in a mess with a significantly high unemployment rate, plummeting housing and financial markets, and lower consumer spending. The main goal was to stabilize the economy and spur growth, primarily by revitalizing the banks.With the Fed injecting money into the economy, banks had more money to lend and earn from that. This liquidity infusion also fueled deposit growth. Over the years, major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) recorded a significant increase in their deposit balances.As the economy was in shambles, lending activity failed to rise significantly. So, the banks were saddled with considerable amount of deposits. But with gradual economic recovery, loan demand improved. Along with this, banks witnessed a rise in deposits. So, they didn’t face much competition for attracting deposits to meet higher demand for loans.As economy has stabilized and there seems to be no need for liquidity support, the Fed is gradually tightening its monetary policy. In December 2015, the central bank raised its interest rates for the first time in a decade. Since then, three more rate hikes have been announced.Given the continued improvement in the economy, interest rate hikes will likely continue. With banks being one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher rates, this will support their revenue growth.Moreover, last month, the Fed announced the timeline for commencing its balance-sheet (currently standing at a whopping $4.5 trillion) normalization program. Banks are likely to benefit from this as well. As the Fed buys back short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This, in turn, will result in rise in the yield on long-term bonds and thus banks will gain from improved margin spreads.While everyone is looking at the banks’ benefits from the Fed’s tightening monetary policy, there is a downside to it as well.Increased Competition for DepositsThe Fed’s plan to unwind its balance sheet is expected to result in deposit outflows. Also, as the money supply in the economy will reduce, lesser amount will get deposited in the banks.Such a scenario will lead to increased competition among banks to attract deposits. Similar sentiments are being echoed by top executives of major banks.William Demchak, chairman and chief executive of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), at an investors’ conference in September noted that competition for customer deposits could increase “partly as a result of the Fed draining cash out of the system by shrinking its balance sheet.”Earlier in July at second quarter earnings conference call, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) chief financial officer Terrance Dolan said “…as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits.”Competition will likely be more intense for wholesale deposits — those coming from institutional clients and large companies.Also, as the rise of online banking has made it easier from customers to switch banks and with the Fed expected to further increase interest rates, it will become easy for banks to offer higher rates on deposits. For customers stuck with persistently low deposit rates till now, banks providing higher rates on savings account will become more attractive.Nevertheless, with economy improving gradually, deposits are expected to rise as well. Specifically, retail deposits are expected to rise driven by higher rates on deposits.Overall, deposits are expected to continue increasing given the economic growth, though the pace of rise is likely to be slower compared with the QE period.Of the above-mentioned major banks, JPMorgan, BB&T, Bank of America, PNC Financial and Citigroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2509,WFC,"At a heated senator meeting held on Tuesday, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan vigorously tried to defend America’s third-largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators.Sloan was grilled for forcing the affected customers of fake accounts scandal into arbitration in order to avoid courtroom experience. He responded by saying that the bank has not prevented its customers from suing and would not do so in the future either.The senators charged Wells Fargo of hiding the problems in auto insurance business in the meeting that was held last year regarding the fake accounts that had been created.Further, in a follow-up after the hearing, the committee had asked whether there was any evidence of other fraudulent activity in the bank or discovery of any misconduct. To this, the bank reported only about certain employees in the community banking division and did not disclose the auto insurance scandal, which had come to light in July 2016.Sloan defended himself by saying that he got the insurance program suspended in September 2016 after he came to know about the problems.While one of the democrats suggested regulators to consider revoking the bank's charter and shutting it down completely, the other suggested Wells Fargo’s CEO to be fired.Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and has promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come.Further, Sloan also disclosed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is investigating fees charged from customers to extend interest rate lock periods for mortgages. He also revealed that the bank plans to contact over 108,000 customers to address complaints about fees charged to lock in mortgage rates.The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance. The legal costs will remain elevated in the near future and will hurt its financials.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained nearly 1% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 9.5%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the financial space are M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), Syvonus Financial Corp.

2510,WFC,"Amid mounting litigation issues, the U.S. lender — Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) — has once again come under regulators’ eyes. Per Reuters, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) might charge the bank with new penalties for issues related to car insurance and mortgage loans.Wells Fargo is under OCC’s investigation for improperly charging customers for car insurance and mortgage loans, disclosed this year. Therefore, if the inquiry reveals violation of agreement, known as a ‘Matter Requiring Attention’ to finish off unfair and deceptive business malpractices, the bank will be charged with new penalties. Moreover, issues related to previous consumer lending continues for this U.S. lender as well.This week, the bank’s chief executive — Tim Sloan — will be answering the Senate Banking Committee’s questions related to scandal over the bank’s sales practices since the past year. Thus, the new penalties of the OCC will depend to an extent on Sloan’s assurance to lawmakers.It has been almost a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring.

2511,WFC,"Friday, July 14th, 2017It’s finally here, and people like me now have something concrete to talk about: Q2 Earnings Season. It tends to be the quarter that least affects stocks and the market as a whole, based on the summer season and where it lays within the fiscal year: Q1 kicks off performance metrics for the full year, and Q3 brings them into the final stretch. Q4 is the final word. Q2 is… Q2.JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines, reporting $1.82 per share compared to the Zacks consensus of $1.57. Revenues of $26.4 billion topped expectations of $24.8 billion, as well as the year-ago number of $25.2 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon was quoted as saying the U.S. consumer remains healthy, but that without gridlock in Washington DC, his company would grow faster.JPM shared are trading down in the pre-market following the earnings announcement, which may speak to the “quality” of the beat. Certain aspects like a low loss provision in the quarter might be seen as temporary. But the company was boosted by lending, which illustrates financial market activity which we may see pop up elsewhere in the economy.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) beat earnings expectations as well, reporting $1.28 per share — 7 cents better than the Zacks consensus expectation of $1.21. Revenues of $17.90 billion also topped the consensus estimate of $17.32 billion, up 2% year over year. Healthier revenue streams were somewhat offset by higher costs of credit in the quarter. Like JPMorgan, Citigroup has a recent history of beating earnings estimates quarter after quarter. Pre-market shares are down slightly, however.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus, by 5 cents to $1.07 per share. Revenues, however, missed just slightly at $22.2 billion from the $22.3 billion expected. Pre-market shares of Wells Fargo are also down following the report; perhaps whatever good was expected by financial analysts has already been baked into the share price. Although market participants look to be in a relatively hesitant move at this hour, so perhaps we’re merely looking at the present mood of traders, subject to change.PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates as well this morning, posting a 9-cent beat to $2.10 per share. Revenues of $4.06 billion improved on the $4.00 billion expected, 7% greater than in the year-ago quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also trading down slightly in today’s pre-market.Keep in mind these banking majors are all up big from this time a year ago, 50+% in some cases (aside from Wells Fargo, which has had its internal issues about generating false accounts and its subsequent comeuppance from regulators; it is up only 16% year over year). So perhaps a “sell the news” scenario is in place for these companies on the first full day of Q2 earnings season, which is nothing to fear for longer-term market participants.Inflation Metrics MutedElsewhere, a new Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning for June in unchanged, slightly under analysts’ expectations. The core year-over-year read was 1.7%, about in-line with the modest gains expected in this inflation metric. A decline in energy prices (-2.8%) and airline fares (-2.7%) were notable in these latest monthly numbers.Retail Sales for June were also in negative territory: -0.2% on the headline, whereas analysts had been expecting a positive number. This follows a -0.3% read from May, meaning retailers have seen overall prices slip half of a full percentage point over the past two months. The drop in auto sales (-0.2%) are coming off tougher comps from a year ago, but we see broad-based weakness in retail pricing from last month.This is the sort of thing Janet Yellen and her cohorts at the Fed pay close attention to. We are not seeing inflation bubbling up in the economy as we had expected, especially in light of strong and consistent U.S. employment figures as of late. So while the pre-market appears cautious in trading right now, the mood may shift as it did during Yellen’s testimony a couple days ago: that factors indicate a lesser likelihood of raised interest rates in the near future, which may again spring market buying to new highs.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2512,WFC,"Driven by increase in net revenues in equity securities, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 17.6%. The company reported earnings per share of $3.95, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36. Further, the bottom line witnessed 6% year-over-year improvement.Results were primarily driven by higher equities revenues and low expenses. However, lower fixed income revenues were a headwind. Notably, the quarter witnessed challenging market-making environment, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.Shares of Goldman lost more than 1% in the pre-market trading. Perhaps, lesser support on the fixed income revenues led to investors’ bearish stance. Nonetheless, the actual picture will emerge in the full day’s trading session, with investors and analysts considering the core results.Net earnings of $1.83 billion reflected a slight increase from the prior-year quarter.Solid Revenues in Equity Securities & Low ExpensesGoldman’s net revenue edged down 1% year over year to $7.89 billion in the quarter under review. However, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.57 billion.Quarterly revenues, as per business segments, are as follows:The Institutional Client Services division recorded revenues of $3.1 billion, down 17% year over year. The fall indicated lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution revenues (down 40% year over year), adversely affected by lower revenues from interest rate products, commodities, currencies and credit  products, partially offset by high revenues in mortgage products.However, rise in commissions and fees, along with securities services and equities client execution, resulted in the gain in Equities revenues (up 8%).The Investment Banking division generated revenues of $1.7 billion, down 3% year over year. Results displayed lower debt and equity underwriting revenues, indicating 1% year-over-year decline in total underwriting fees. Further, lower financial advisory revenues (down 6%) were recorded, affected by the decreased number of completed industry-wide transactions during the quarter.The Investment Management division recorded revenues of $1.5 billion, up 13% year over year. The growth was mainly driven by higher incentive and transaction fees, along with management and other fees.The Investing and Lending division’s revenues of $1.6 billion in the quarter were significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. The rise was aided by surge in revenues from investments in equities, partially offset by lower revenues in debt securities and loans.Total operating expenses decreased 2% year over year to $5.4 billion. Expenses moved down mainly due to decline in compensation and employee benefits expenses (down 3%).Non-compensation expenses were almost flat compared with the prior-year quarter. Expenses included elevated level of brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, market development expenses, along with depreciation and amortization expenses, mostly offset by reduced other expenses, driven by lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.Strong Capital PositionGoldman exhibited a robust capital position in the reported quarter. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% under the Basel III Advanced Approach, highlighting the valid transitional provisions. The figure was down from 12.9% recorded in the prior quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 6.3% at the end of the second quarter, down from 6.4% recorded in the prior quarter.Adjusted return on average common shareholders’ equity, on an annualized basis, was 8.7% in the reported quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring second-quarter 2017, the company repurchased 6.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $221.92 and a total cost of $1.47 billion.ConclusionResults of Goldman highlight an impressive quarter. The company’s well-diversified business, apart from its solid investment banking operations, continues to ensure earnings stability. Its focus to capitalize on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments, including the digital consumer lending platform, should bolster overall business growth. However, costs stemming from unresolved litigations remain near- to medium-term headwinds. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

2513,WFC,"As investors continue to react to the fresh earnings reports from banking giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), all eyes will soon shift to investment behemoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), which is slated to report its Q2 results on Tuesday morning. However, a quick glance at Monday’s price action reveals a cautionary tale for the financial space. Despite earnings beats across the board, all three of the aforementioned bank stocks are slumping to start the week, suggesting that there is something more to the story here. Does this hesitation foreshadow a similar post-earnings slump from Goldman Sachs? Will the factors weighing down the banking giants also impact the more investment-focused companies? Let’s take a closer look. Banks Slump on Earnings Beats Although some investors consider the second quarter to be the least important in the fiscal calendar, our rising rate environment and tumultuous political climate mean that no banking report can be ignored right now (also read: Q2 Earnings Season Finally Here: JPM, C, WFC, PNC Beat).  JPMorgan Chase posted earnings of $1.82 per share and revenues of $26.4 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.57 and $25.2 billion, respectively. Nevertheless, JPM shares fell about 1% on Friday and continued their minor slump on Monday morning.  Certain aspects of the company’s report, such as its low loss provision, could be interpreted as temporary strengths. However, JPMorgan reported strong lending figures, which is an indicator of an active economy. In fact. the overall strength of the economy was confirmed by the latest comments from CEO Jamie Dimon, who also mentioned that his company would be growing even faster without the gridlock in Washington D.C. Citigroup also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations, with profits of $1.28 per share and revenues of $17.90 billion surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.21 and $17.32 billion. Overall, revenues were up 2% year-over-year, although the company’s markets & securities unit slipped about 5%, which could be more of a precursor for Goldman’s report.  Wells Fargo also joined in on the earnings beat fun, but its quarterly revenues came in just shy of our consensus estimate. The bank witnessed strong growth in interest income, due in part to increases from trading assets and investment securities. On the other hand, non-interest income slipped about 7% thanks to weakness in the mortgage banking segment and lower net gains from trading activities. Outlook for Goldman Interestingly enough, the strength of the global economy could be what hurts Goldman this quarter. Indeed, lower volatility in both the bond and equity markets is expected to lead to less trading, which means lower trading revenues for the investment banker (also read: Will Bleak Trading Revenue Hurt Goldman's Q2 Earnings?).  Additionally, one of the more sluggish corners of the global economy, the M&A space, is hurting Goldman. Continued weakness in this area, as well as soft results in the debt underwriting segment, will contribute to the company’s Q2 challenges. Headed into its report, Goldman Sachs sits at a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Additionally, its Earnings ESP of -1.43% does not improve its likelihood of an earnings beat. With trading activity down and financial stocks struggling to move higher even after earnings beats, Goldman looks like a risky play right now. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

2516,WFC,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts. Banks are continuing with such initiatives with an aim to focus on core operations and enhance profitability, going forward.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 7, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

Higher net interest income was primarily responsible for this earnings beat.How Was the Estimate Revision Trend?You should note that the earnings estimate for Wells Fargo depicted pessimism prior to the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased around 1% over the last 7 days.    However, Wells Fargo has a decent earnings surprise history. Before posting earnings beat in Q2, the company delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters. Overall, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.52% in the trailing four quarters. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteRevenue Came In Lower Than Expected    Wells Fargo posted revenues of $22.2 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion.
