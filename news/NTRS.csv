7,NTRS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) were among all 35 banks that passed the Federal Reserve's stress test, clearing a major hurdle toward huge hikes in capital returns.The Federal Reserve said the nation's largest banks are strongly capitalized, though Goldman Sachs (GS) came the closest to missing the mark, posting a leverage ratio of 3.1% vs. the Fed's minimum requirement of 3%.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a press release.The Dodd-Frank stress test results detail whether banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. This is the first of two tests. On June 28, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.Some analysts see a majority of banks making payouts that exceed profits for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo among them.""I don't think generally today's results, that everyone passed, are a big surprise to anybody. It was largely expected,"" Raymond James managing director Michael Rose said.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stress test actually being stricter this year.Under 2018's stress test scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak. This is tougher than the 6.5% drop that was modeled last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's stress test outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Banks will be able to unveil their capital return plans for the coming year following the release of the second set of results next Thursday. Those tests determine how large a capital buffer that banks need to protect themselves from a financial crisis.But Wells Fargo is at an elevated risk to fail the June 28 test due to oversight issues related to its account-opening scandal and perhaps a lack of focus by management on the exam due to the scandal, Rose said.""Even if everybody passes quantitatively, (Fed regulators have) historically made an example out of one or more banks on the qualitative side,"" he told IBD. ""I wouldn't expect them to deviate from that historical pattern when we get next week's CCAR results.""Shares of JPMorgan closed essentially unchanged on the stock market today. Bank of America rose 0.2% and Wells Fargo dipped 0.2%, while Citigroup gained 0.4%. Goldman Sachs fell 0.4% and Morgan Stanley (MS) slid 0.2%.After the close, Wells Fargo edged up, while the others fell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoldman analysts see State Street (STT), Wells Fargo and Northern Trust (NTRS) able to increase payout ratios the most among large-cap and trust banks. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Not everyone is quite so bullish, however. The likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James see the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks. This is around a quarter more than in 2017.""We look for the median bank's total payout ratio to approach 100%, while both dividends and share repurchase increase over 20% from CCAR 2017's level,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note. ""We believe the pace of dividend increases could exceed that of share repurchase.""There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.One fly in the ointment is the current flattening yield curve. This could lower profits, as banks make money on the difference between long- and short-term rates. The spread between U.S. Treasuries 2-year and 10-year yields has not been this narrow in a flattening process since 2005.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These Banks Are Seen Paying Out The Most To Investors After Stress TestWhy Tougher Bank Stress Test May Not Hurt Dividends, BuybacksIBD Stock Of The Day: Bank To The Tech Stars Sets Up Swing Trade, Add-On ChancesStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

The following Thursday, June 28, the Fed will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.While individual banks have paid out more than they earned, this would be the first time since 2008 that it has happened at a majority of the top banks. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 13 out of the 25 banks it follows to be approved to pay out more than they earn over the next four quarters.

11,NTRS,"Two bank stocks in the superregional group — Comerica (CMA) and Northern Trust (NTRS) — have recently appeared in the Big Cap 20. A few statistics point to where some of the market's strength is emerging so far this year.The S&P 500 is down 3.2%  for the year. The Big Cap 20 is up 3.1%. The superregional bank group is up 1.3%. The bank sector, which includes seven industry groups, is down 1.66%. Northern Trust is down 0.4%, and Comerica is up 5.6%.So far this year, the superregional group is the leader among bank groups.Chicago-based Northern Trust has accelerated its earnings growth in recent quarters. Earnings rose 6% vs. year-ago levels in the first quarter of 2017, then 10%, 11%, and 20% in the most recently reported quarter. The Street expects earnings to increase 27% in the current quarter.Annual earnings growth is expected to hit 29% in 2018, which would be the fastest growth in 10 years.Two new factors could be helping the banks. First, rising interest rates are expected to boost the banks' net profit margins.Second, the Republican changes to the Dodd-Frank law will ease some of the regulations affecting the banks, especially those banks with less than $250 billion in assets. According to SEC filings for the year ended in December, Northern Trust's total assets were $138.6 billion. Comerica's total assets were $71.6 billion.From the smaller banks' perspective, that's good news. However, there's some bad news that goes along with the changes.From a free-market perspective, the bad news is that the Republicans are not repealing Dodd-Frank. Not even close. They are ensuring that much of it will survive. Regulators will continue to have control over how big capital cushions should be and how much in profits banks can return to shareholders.The Senate has approved the changes, but the House had yet to vote on its version, as of Friday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNorthern Trust's annualized dividend yield is 1.6%. The long-term estimated annual dividend growth rate is 6%. Comerica's annual payout is 1.3%. The dividend growth rate is 11%.The atmosphere could now be more favorable to increasing bank dividends, as profits improve in the sector and fears recede from the 2008 collapse of Lehman Bros.Comerica is based in Dallas. Quarterly earnings increased 49%, 40% and most recently 29%. The Street expects Q1 earnings growth to roll in at 47%, which would put growth back on the high end of the trend.Annual earnings growth increased 57% last year after breaking free from a five-year growth rate of 7%. Analysts peg 2018 growth at 37%.Pretax margin last year reached 39%, the best in at least nine years.Results from the next annual stress tests for banks are expected to be released at the end of June.RELATED:Look For An Exit When Leaders CrumbleIPO Bases Are Unusual But Can Be ProfitableThink Big Profits: The Rally Around The High Tight Flag

33,NTRS,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak. REITs, utilities and other ""defensive stocks"" were not immune to the sell-offs.(A version of this column was first published on Dec. 12, 2016.)RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying PowerWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

41,NTRS,"Congress is set to give a bunch of banks more of what they want — which is to say, fewer regulators in their lives — with legislation making its way through the Senate this week.X The Senate on Tuesday voted to begin debate on a bill that would free some banks from taking stress tests, drafting plans to show how they'd wind down in a crisis, and being ""too big to fail.""The legislation has the backing of the GOP and some Democrats, and could pass the chamber this week. But how will it actually affect the biggest banks, like Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and others?""In a very limited way,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said. ""The bill is geared toward smaller banks — banks under $250 billion in assets.""He later added: ""You'll see this rhetoric that this going back to the bad old days, and this is, say, a giveaway to the big banks. Not to the biggest banks it's not.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11
"
42,NTRS,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio.

Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today.

The Nasdaq fell 1.3%, pulled down by the Philadelphia semiconductor index's more than 4% loss.Small caps surged with the Russell 2000 adding 0.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly up. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, financials led. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) popped 2.5%. Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.9%. American Express (AXP) grabbed a 1.5% gain, but Visa (V) dived 3.5%.American Express is bouncing off its 10-week moving average line, while Visa is testing its 50-day line.Bank stocks were up midday Wednesday after rising Tuesday on the testimony of Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve nominee for chief. Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that  he favors easing bank regulations. Powell's confirmation hearing was smooth, disturbing neither senators nor Wall Street.Among the bank sector, stocks notching 52-week highs included JPMorgan; Morgan Stanley (MS), up 2.5%; Bank of America (BAC), up 3%; SVB Financial (SIVB), up 2.5%; Comerica (CMA), up 4%; and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), up 4%.

Tech is suffering but other areas are rising. In Tuesday's new highs list, the building sector delivered 29 new highs; banks, 27; and finance, 22. Chips only accounted for two new highs.Factors influencing the strong side of the stock market include: Trump's choice to head the Fed, who is finding favor; the Republican tax-cut package which won tentative but positive remarks from maverick Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine; and recent economic data, including a 17-year high for consumer confidence.Before the open Wednesday, the bulls received additional good news.

48,NTRS,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak. REITs, utilities and other ""defensive stocks"" were not immune to the sell-offs.(A version of this column was first published on Dec. 12, 2016.)RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying PowerWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

Tuesday's rebound from the 50-day moving average offered a possible new buying opportunity, though investors should try to buy 50-day/10-week rebounds as quickly as possible.Goldman Sachs climbed 0.8% to 241.36, near a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base and moving above its 50-day line in strong volume.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are key reasons why the Dow industrials rallied and the S&P 500 was nearly flat as the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled.Citigroup rose 1.8% to 75.04. Citigroup is closing in on a 76.24 buy point but cleared an alternative entry at 74.95 intraday after powering above its 50-day line Tuesday.Bank of America (BAC) advanced 2.3%.

Schwab is just within range of a 46.31 buy point of a flat base cleared on Tuesday. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) climbed 1.7%, now extended.Several factors appeared to be driving the rally in financials.The GOP's tax-cut plan on Tuesday cleared the Senate Budget Committee along party lines, moving the bill closer to a full vote in the chamber. A full Senate vote could come this week.The bill, which would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, is likely to contain a tax-raising mechanism that would kick in if the benefits from the tax cuts don't pan out as expected, easing concerns about the debt.But other GOP lawmakers are opposed to that mechanism. The Senate bill also still needs to be fused together with the House's.Jerome Powell, who President Trump has chosen to succeed Janet Yellen as head the Federal Reserve, said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that ""the case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together"" while also stressing that he sees no sign of economic ""overheating."" The next policy meeting takes place on Dec. 12-13.When the Fed raises the rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other to meet financial quotas, banks pass the higher costs on to consumers, often through raising rates on their own loans. The higher rates help improve banks' financial results.Meanwhile, Powell hinted that he favors relief on financial rules. While not a surprise, the combination of steady of monetary policy and regulatory relief is positive for banks.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose Wednesday. That rate also influences the rates on credit that banks offer to their customers.Wall Street has been concerned about the flattening of the yield curve, a gauge of inflation expectations that tracks the difference between short-term and long-term government debt. Earlier this month, the gap between the short end and long end of that curve was at its narrowest in a decade, raising concerns about a weaker economy. The yield spread widened slightly on Wednesday.The short end of that curve has crept up as the Fed raises rates. When Wall Street expects the economy to be stronger in the years ahead, the long end of the curve rises, as future economic growth raises prices and investors demand a greater return on their bonds to make up for the declining buying power of the dollar.Rising yields were definitely a factor Wednesday. Dow financials JPMorgan, Goldman and American Express (AXP) rallied, but Visa (V) fell sharply. Visa doesn't hold credit balances, so higher rates don't offer a benefit.The U.K. and the EU are reportedly coming closer to agreeing on what the island nation will pay to get out of the bloc.

62,NTRS,"U.S. stock indexes stumbled midday Thursday, but the Dow held up best among the market indexes.The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq sawed off 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 was practically flat.XVolume was running lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time in the previous session.President Trump this afternoon is expected to name his choice to head the Federal Reserve. The consensus view is that the nominee will be Jerome Powell, a current member of the Fed's board. If so, Powell would be a continuity pick. Barack Obama first chose Powell to serve on the Fed's board of governors in 2012.Blue chips were mostly down. Losers in the 30-component Dow held the advantage over winners by a 9-2 ratio. Home Depot (HD) was the biggest percentage loser, down 2.3% in strong volume following  proposed tax changes that may hurt the housing industry. A drop is vigorous volume is considered bearish for a stock. However, Home Depot's drop was arrested at the 50-day line, which is regarded as a positive.Home Depot will report fiscal Q3 results Nov. 14. The fiscal year ends in January. The Street expects fiscal Q3 earnings to rise 13% to $1.81 per share. Revenue growth is estimated at more than 5% to $24.46 billion.Home Depot broke out in September but never rose much more than 4% before retreating. The stock is barely above its 160.96 buy point.In the IBD 50, declining issues led advancing issues by a 5-3 ratio. The biggest loser was electronics parts maker Kemet (KEM), which plunged 27% on its quarterly results. Earnings grew 246% but that only matched the consensus view. Revenue popped 61%, edging above views by about 1%.The biggest gainer in the IBD 50 was Ichor Holdings (ICHR), up almost 5%.Marketwide, breakouts midday Thursday included payment provider FleetCor Technologies (FLT) and insurer Allstate (ALL). Both made their moves in strong volume.Some bank stocks could be setting up for breakouts in cup-with-handle patterns. They include Goldman Sachs (GS), KeyCorp (KEY) and Northern Trust (NTRS).In economic news, first-time jobless claims were almost 3% fewer than expected.Meanwhile, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported planned job cuts of 29,831 in October, below the prior month's 32,346. Through October, the year-to-date figure was the lowest since 1997.

64,NTRS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

68,NTRS,"John W. Rogers, Jr. was introduced to investing at age 12, when his father began to give him gifts of stock instead of toys at each birthday and Christmas. His father's guidance paid off.Now 59 years old, Rogers is founder, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, with $11.7 billion in assets under management (AUM). The firm, founded in January 1983, runs six no-load mutual funds with $4.6 billion in cumulative AUM as well as separately managed accounts. And Rogers is a pioneer. He was the first African-American founder of a major mutual fund complex, preceding Eddie C. Brown of Brown Capital Management by about six months.In addition to his executive duties, Rogers is lead manager of $2.3 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX). He celebrated his 30th anniversary at the helm in November. Especially at that task, Rogers has an appetite for smaller stocks. And he takes an emphatically value-oriented approach in his investing. ""Smaller stocks are more nimble, flexible and adaptable,"" he said. ""Therefore, they're able to grow more rapidly."" And undervalued stocks whose fundamentals are sound offer opportunities to benefit from underappreciated gems, he says.His willingness to give undervalued stocks the time to blossom is reflected in the tortoise — you remember how the seemingly slow tortoise in Aesop's fable beat the swift hare to the finish line — that Ariel prominently displays on its website.Ariel's broad framework has been especially productive over the past five years, when his fund's 16.85% average annual return through May 31 topped 98% of its midcap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Despite his value bent, 13 of his 39 stocks have IBD's Composite Rating of 80 or higher. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings.Among those high Comp Rating holdings as of March 31 were Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), which is up 34% this year; Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is up 22%; Charles River Laboratories (CRL), which is 21% this year; KKR (KKR), which is up 20%; and First American Financial (FAF), which is up 17% this year.Rogers spoke with IBD about his investment approach and career from his office in Chicago.IBD: John, why do you focus on undervalued smaller stocks?Rogers: I worked at William Blair & Company for a couple of years (as a stock broker). Mr. Blair, who was in his nineties at the time, talked about the fact that small companies could grow faster than large ones. I loved that thesis. I thought it made a lot of sense. More people cover large stocks. There are more inefficiencies in small and medium-sized companies. It's easier to find inefficiently priced stocks there.IBD: And why undervalued companies in particular?Rogers: The value component started from books I read. I went to Princeton. Burton Malkiel, an economics professor, had (recently) written ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" (which has helped popularize idea that large markets tend to be efficient). But even he believed that some stocks can get vastly over- or undervalued. And I liked the idea that if you leaned against the crowd, you could be successful (as an investor).I read books by John Train, Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and John Templeton. They all liked being contrarians. They all said that the best time to invest is when others are fearful. So as someone who had grown up as an only child and was comfortable with being independent, I was comfortable with an investment approach that involved not following the crowd.IBD: Did the market itself reinforce your tilt?Rogers: I graduated from Princeton in 1980. The market had not been good for a period. There had been a long slot of an underperforming market. So, low P/E stocks were something of a safe haven. There were few us focused on small stocks and low P/E stocks.IBD: Let's talk about stocks. I'm asking your thesis as of your latest disclosure. Zebra Tech makes thermal and thermal transfer printers. What do you like there?Rogers: They're in a sweet spot, where these products are critical to retailers in tracking inventory. Everyone needs to track it rapidly and with precision, in these days of Amazon (AMZN) (providing customers with quick turnaround).And we've seen a new wave of suppliers using their new technology.But a year ago the company was mired in bad press regarding a company Zebra bought from Motorola Solutions. It was supposed to enhance their business and diversify their product mix. But there was a sense they had overpaid, that the integration was not going smoothly and that Zebra's balance sheet was impaired by it.Now, a year later, management has worked hard to show their balance sheet is improved. The stresses of the acquisition seem to be settling down. We're seeing the benefits of the two companies being put together. We like to take advantage of those types of uncertain situations if we believe in the long-term prospects of a business.IBD: You've owned Royal Caribbean Cruises since 2007. Is this one of your stories about long-term patience?Rogers: They have gotten rational in the way they compete. They have not created too much capacity. That's critical. More people want to cruise, but not many companies can provide that experience.The industry has overcome negatives. Energy prices were high. The recession was a challenge. There have been health scares. Cruise ships crashing into things. There's always headline risk. But in the long-term they overcome those obstacles. And this company is well run. We know their CEO. He's highly competent. And it's stayed cheap — hasn't gotten expensive in last 10 years.IBD: You've owned MSG Networks (MSGN) since 2011. You also hold its sibling Madison Square Garden (MSG). Is this another story about long-term patience?Rogers: Both companies have wide moats around them. There's only one Madison Square Garden, the world's greatest arena in arguably the world best city, where there's a big population, lots of tourism, many businesses in the city. Having this extraordinary arena in the heart of Manhattan is irreplaceable and hard to compete with.Also, it has lots of real estate that's substantially undervalued on its books. It's got the sports franchises — the Rangers, the Knicks, the Liberty. The Knicks especially appear undervalued.And in MSG Networks you've got the broadcast rights to teams, which is very undervalued. And eventually the Knicks will be good again, as we've learned here in Chicago with our Cubs (who won the World Series after a drought of 108 years). That will make them even more valuable.There are challenges in media. But if you have the right live content, there will be a place for you on all of the different (carriers') bundles and you will do well.IBD'S TAKE: MSG Networks ranks No. 1 in IBD's Media-Radio/TV industry group. It has a 37.1% annual pretax margin and a 54.1% return on equity (ROE). See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.IBD: What will enable Northern Trust (NTRS) to break out of what has been a sideways trend?Rogers: They are not a traditional bank. They are a huge custodian of assets for family offices, endowments and pensions. Only a few companies can compete with that, so there's a significant moat around their customer, custody and record keeping businesses.If you're a large endowment or family office, you let Northern Trust manage all of your finances. It's one-stop shopping. If you're a pension, you let them manage your money rather than hire staff yourself.They're a global business that will benefit if interest rates continue to move higher.IBD: KKR has done well for you, but you've trimmed your stake. What are your concerns?Rogers: Pension plans, endowments and wealth families believe that traditional long-only, 60% stock-40% bond portfolios are no longer the way to go. People want substantial exposure to alternatives.We believe that KKR is one of the top handful of major global private equity firms that are well-positioned to manage assets all over the world. Private equity has far outpaced every asset class, especially hedge funds, over the last 30 years. And this stock is still cheap. There's still a lot of value to be recognized here.IBD: Charles River offers researchers mice and rats that are bred for specific types of tests. Earnings per share grew 15%, 21% and 32% the past three quarters. What's your play?Rogers: Few people have the ability to help researchers in the health care field the way that Charles River does. They're a leader in breeding modified rats used to help health care companies test drugs and make sure they're healthy for humans.We've been there and seen their rows of color-coded cages. It makes you see their moat. There's always a little cloud (over this sort of stock) because of the stress on pharmaceutical companies. But we think this company is here for the long term. And there's still value in it.IBD: Many growth managers aim for sexy tech stocks. First American Financial sells title insurance and related services. What's their sex appeal for you?Rogers: They have products that are part of every real estate transaction in the U.S. Even during the worst of the real estate crisis, they were able to hold their own. Now they're poised to benefit from the housing recovery and economic recovery.IBD: Is Ariel a socially conscious investor?Rogers: The simple answer is that while we do not label or promote our funds and separate accounts as ""socially responsible,"" we have integrated ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations in our investing process since our firm's founding in 1983...As an example, in terms of exclusionary factors, our domestic mutual funds do not invest in corporations with a primary source of revenue derived from the production or sale of tobacco products or the manufacture of handguns.IBD: When you were young, what else did your father do to expose you to investing?Rogers: He felt it was really important. He let me get the dividend checks every three months from the blue chips he invested in on my behalf. Then he encouraged me to read the newsletters and quarterly reports.Eventually he took me to meet his broker, Stacey Adams, who worked for Freehling & Co. He was the first African-American broker on LaSalle Street. I sat there, and he taught me to read the ticker and how to invest. He was a great role model and mentor.IBD: Your father was quite a dynamic guy, wasn't he?Rogers: He had quite a story. He was orphaned at 12. He moved to Chicago to live with a kindly uncle. He went to teachers college. He had a rough go of it. He worked odd jobs to pay his tuition, and he taught math at the public schools. He joined the Air Corps in World War II and became one of the original Tuskegee Airmen. He was a fighter pilot, who flew over 120 missions.When he came home, he tried to talk his way into the University of Chicago Law School. At first they turned him down. They weren't as welcoming of a place back then. My dad went back in his captain's uniform, and he got in.It was hard for my mother too. They kept telling her she should become a paralegal instead of a lawyer when she tried to get in. Now my father and mother's pictures hang in the law school. It became a progressive place, and it was kind of them to honor my parents for their historic roles.RELATED: Why This Wells Fargo Stock Mutual Fund Is 'Special'How Boosting Retirement Savings By 1% Of Salary Turns Into $100K Of Income

71,NTRS,"Stock indexes stepped down in moderate losses Friday afternoon, but leaders continued to suffer some swats from the bears.The Nasdaq lost 0.2%, and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3%. The large cap S&P 500 retreated 0.2%, while the small cap Russell 2000 echoed the loss. Volume in the stock market today fell about 13% on the Nasdaq vs. the previous session and 4% on the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average was on track to end a 10-session win streak, but the significance of that was questionable. The win streak was on the cheap side. Four of the daily gains were less than 0.2%. The real concern for individual investors isn't the Dow's streak but the pounding some leaders are suffering.On Friday, oil patch play Antero Midstream Partners (AM) stabbed more than 3% lower in brisk volume. Mobile technologies provider InterDigital (IDCC) staggered nearly 3% lower, adding to Wednesday's 13% drop. Some early losers were staging reversals. Apple (AAPL) sagged 0.9% in the first hour of trade but reversed to a 0.3% loss. Apple is well-extended from a January breakout. The stock is about 10% above its 50-day line and 24% above its 200-day line.Tesla (TSLA) suffered a 2.3% dent but then popped out all of the dent for a 0.7% gain. Tesla broke out this month but is now back below its buy point.Nvidia (NVDA) also staged a positive reversal, turning a nearly 5% loss into a 0.9% gain.IBD'S TAKE: Be quick to spot a stock's change in character and profits are very likely.Among the highly rated bank stocks, winners were scarce. About half the stocks in the Big Cap 20 are bank stocks, and bank stocks have been market leaders. On Friday, all were down. The charts, though, didn't look bad. The bank stocks are holding above their 50-day lines, with super regional Northern Trust (NTRS) an exception. Northern Trust edged below its 50-day line Friday, but volume was soft.Industry group leadership had a lackluster composition. The day's leaders included department stores, home furnishings and apparel retailers, but all those groups are market laggards. On the downside, oil-related stocks were the day's big losers.West Texas intermediate crude oil fell 0.7% to just above $54 a barrel.RELATED:Nvidia Fall Stemmed By Reassuring Analyst CommentsHow One Bank Emerged From The Financial Crisis To Reach New HighsWhy These Two Groups Outperformed The Market On ThursdayWhere To Follow The Leading Large Caps: Inside IBD Big Cap 20

74,NTRS,"Stocks quickly surrendered early gains Thursday, then retreated to deepening losses in the final session before the transition of power in the U.S. presidency.The Dow Jones industrial average ended the session down 0.4%, slipping into negative territory for the year. The S&P 500 also shed 0.4%, while the Nasdaq notched a 0.3% decline.Bond yields ran higher, the dollar was mixed and oil prices edged up, with West Texas intermediate largely staying put between $51 and $52 per barrel.After the close, IBM (IBM) beat sales and profit expectations and its guidance was above views, too. But the stock fell ,more than 2% in extended trading. The stock is in buy range from the 161.96 buy point of cup with handle.American Express (AXP) was down slightly after the close following the company's earnings release. Results were mixed although management gave a bullish outlook.Among the day's more breathtaking moves, railroad CSX (CSX) gapped up and surged to a 23% gain in massive trade. Outgoing Canadian Pacific (CP) CEO Hunter Harrison will reportedly step down five months earlier than planned and team up with activist investor Paul Hilal to try to put Harrison in a top management post at CSX, according to a Wednesday report from the Wall Street Journal. After Thursday's gap up, the stock is extended from a rebound off its 10-week moving average, but the strong action is a bullish sign.Fiber-optic gear maker Oclaro (OCLR) was also a big winner, soaring 17% after reporting preliminary revenue and operating income above prior guidance. The move punched shares back above their 10-week moving average, placing them well up the right side of a base begun in November.Tesla Motors (TSLA) climbed 2% in quick trade, scaling up the right side of a base with a 269.44 potential buy point. Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the electric car maker to overweight with a 305 price target.In a holiday-shortened week buffeted by pre-inauguration volatility and news bytes out of Congressional hearings of incoming administration Cabinet picks, tobacco, automakers and shipping fleets have thus far posted the strongest moves among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.A heavy-volume, 10% fall by Atlanta-based Aaron's (AAN) dragged consumer electronics retailers to the week's worst performance among industries. Raymond James reduced its rating on Aaron's to market perform from strong buy.The No. 1-ranked industry group, super regional banks, is also among the week's hardest hit, with Northern Trust (NTRS) down more than 7%, and SVB Financial (SIVB), Regions Financial (RF) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) down more than 4% apiece.On Friday, the economic calendar is pretty bare with just the Baker-Hughes rig count coming out at 1 p.m. ET.

The stock has shaped a saucer with handle with a potential buy point at 137.42. The pattern is first stage, which is more likely to work than later bases.Home Depot's fiscal year ends in January. The Street expects 2017 earnings to rise 18%, which represents an upward revision. Q4 results will be released Feb. 21.Procter & Gamble (PG), another Dow component, advanced 1.21 to 85.22 in brisk volume. The megacap retook its 50-day and 200-day lines. Procter & Gamble is working on a flat base but has some work to do on the right side of its pattern. The base is first stage.In the S&P 500, superregional bank Comerica (CMA) took the hardest hit, gapping down 3.83 to 66.09. Volume was heavy. The company reported quarterly results, topping the earnings target by about 14%. Revenue was lower than expected.IBD'S TAKE: Don't ignore tobacco stocks.

87,NTRS,"""There is still earnings pressure on the banks,"" said Mutascio, adding that the U.S. economy is chugging along at 2% or so growth while the global economy is weakening. Some analysts say the prospect of higher interest rates may already be baked into earnings estimates.

94,NTRS,"Four financial stocks are making a case that they've hit a bottom, but how convincing a case is it? U.S. Bancorp (USB), PNC Financial (PNC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Northern Trust (NTRS) haven't rallied much after the market's mini flash crash in the week that ended Aug. 28. But they haven't gone down much, either. Despite weak Accumulation/Distribution Ratings, all four are trading tightly, moving sideways and holding above their Aug. 24 lows, leaving some to believe that the selling has run its course.IBD tracks three of them in its Banks-Super Regional industry group. Wells Fargo is a member of the Banks-Money Center group.Interest rates will start heading higher at some point, which should help profitability at banks, thanks to higher net interest margin — the difference between interest income and the amount of interest paid out to lenders.U.S. Bancorp pays a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents a share, giving it an annualized dividend yield of around 2.5%. At an investor conference in mid-September, the company said that it would have to resort to cost-cutting initiatives if rates don't start rising soon.PNC Financial pays a quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share, giving it a yield of around 2.3%. As more and more consumers embrace mobile and the Internet for banking, PNC is redesigning many of its branches with financial consultants rather than tellers, who typically help with more mundane tasks.Wells Fargo's quarterly dividend of 37.5 cents a share gives it a yield of 2.9%. At the end of the second quarter, it was one of Warren Buffett's largest holdings.Northern Trust's dividend of 36 cents a share results in a yield of 2.1%. In terms of overall fundamentals, Northern Trust is the standout among the four. The company shows five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Sales growth has accelerated for three straight quarters.

95,NTRS,"A week that started off with business as usual ended on a tumultuous note, with the market swinging wildly in response to the Fed's statement Thursday.Stocks initially rose Thursday afternoon following the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates, then sold off late in the session to end mixed.On Friday, the major indexes sank early before paring some of their losses.Some industry groups were particularly affected by the Fed decision. The super regional banks group reversed sharply lower Thursday afternoon and closed down nearly 3%. On Friday, it lost another 3%.Super regionals ranked No. 126 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from No. 63 six weeks ago. Go to Investors.com to view the full industry group list and rankings.Most of the stocks in the group, including Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial (PNC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB), fell further below their 200-day moving averages. They've been toiling below the support line since last month's big market sell-off.Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they can get bigger net margins. When rates are low, their borrowing costs are low. But the amount they can charge on loans, and banks' earnings from other investments, are also low.Money center bank stocks are taking a hit, too. The group reversed Thursday for a more than 1% loss, and fell north of 2% Friday. It fell to No. 123 from No. 70 six weeks ago.UBS (UBS) gapped down Friday, breaching its 200-day moving average for the first time since March.It's now 13% below a 22.27 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in mid-July. UBS, with a 67 Composite Rating, is the top stock in the group based on that metric.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also gapped down Friday. The stock is holding above its Aug. 24 low, when it triggered the 8%-loss sell rule as it sank as much as 21% during the session. It's now 3% below a 62.97 buy point initially cleared in April.Also among financials, investment bankers and brokers (No. 121) lost further ground Friday.Charles Schwab (SCHW), Credit Suisse (CS), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Cowen (COWN) each gave up more than 3%.Utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, rose both sessions. They tend to outperform when bond yields are low, as they are now.But if rates go up, utility stocks face more competition from bonds because bond yields typically rise.The water supply group (No. 102) was one of the few gainers Friday. The gas distribution utilities group (No. 72) was nearly flat. (For more on utilities, see today's Income Investor column on Page B15.)Real estate investment trusts also tend to move with rates. Investors like them for high yields, but not as much when bond yields go up.Property REITs (No. 128) and mortgage REITs (No. 132) were also among the day's better performers, relative to other groups.

"
98,NTRS,"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has made no secret of his plans to grow the company by leaps and bounds over the next few years, with a goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue, and this is one key avenue the company is using to achieve that through its ""Dreamforce"" initiatives.

102,NTRS,"""The feedback was so strong,"" Mulcahy said. ""This is a paradigm that is not there at the moment.""
"
103,NTRS,"Financial advisors and clients traditionally have maintained a formal relationship in which the advisor spends a significant amount of time preparing paperwork for a face-to-face appointment with a client. That's the extent of the relationship in many cases, Mulcahy said.

104,NTRS,"What Salesforce hopes to do is digitize the ties between advisor and client so there can be constant communication between the two, even in informal settings. Advisors would be able to look at a client's portfolio from the back of a cab or in a coffee line and offer advice instantly online.

105,NTRS,"Mulcahy says Salesforce picked financial services first because the company's existing financial services customers — who advise everyone from high net-worth clients down to the average retail investor — sought ways to deepen relationships with clients.

107,NTRS,"To design its new product, Salesforce worked with wealth management firms, including AIG (AIG) Advisor Group, Northern Trust (NTRS) and United Capital.
"
108,NTRS,"Mulcahy adds there are few competitors who have tapped this market, though there are some who are offering customized programs for advisors of high-net-worth clients. The company's main competitor in this realm would be banks and brokerages themselves who use their own tech teams to develop their own software.

113,NTRS,"Bank stocks have been rallying amid an improving economy and the expectation of higher interest rates, but will the rally continue when second-quarter results start filtering in during July?Financial services specialist Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expects a ""challenging"" second quarter for the big money-center banks amid margin pressures and lower-than-expected trading revenue.As for large regional banks: KBW notes that Wall Street analysts expect residential-mortgage and credit-card balances to rebound in the second quarter, helping to drive commercial and consumer loan growth.Still, KBW analysts expect continued net interest margin compression in the sector.In its second-quarter preview of bank stocks, Deutsche Bank research analysts see ""less upside in the near term,"" given that the big money-center bank stocks have ""rallied nicely"" since last July.So what are their top bank-stock picks?Deutsche Bank's top names among the biggest bank stocks are JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).The former's net interest margin ""may positively surprise,"" Deutsche Bank said, and JPMorgan Chase might also have lower expenses and a decent return on capital.Cost cuts will also likely impact Bank of America positively, the analysts noted. Their ""buy"" rating also reflects ""large leverage to higher interest rates"" and reduced concerns over capital levels.Among the large regional banks, both Deutsche Bank and KBW give high ratings to Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI) as it continues to better manage expenses and its balance sheet.KBW cites SunTrust, Northern Trust (NTRS) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) as the three big regional banks likely to beat Wall Street earnings estimates in Q2.IBD also rates Northern Trust highly, with a Composite Rating of 87 out of a possible 99. Zions has an 80 score, SunTrust a 78 and JPMorgan a 75.Deutsche Bank also has a buy rating on Buffalo, NY-based M&T Bank (MTB) ahead of a long-awaited deal to acquire Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK), which it expects to occur later this year.

139,NTRS,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

140,NTRS,"When Connie Duckworth looks at Wall Street, she sees grand opportunities — for female professionals, not just men.Duckworth's feats back that up.In 1990, 10 years after joining Goldman Sachs (GS), one of America's oldest and most powerful investment banks, the Texas native officially became partner.A Goldman partnership is considered one of the most prestigious and lucrative titles in America, the global financial center.Two others among the 32 Goldman employees who turned partner that year were also women, according to company spokesman Michael DuVally. Duckworth became the first female partner in Goldman's fixed-income group.""While I can't speak to other Wall Street firms, since I spent my career at Goldman, I am often asked how Wall Street could be a good place for women to succeed,"" Duckworth, who specialized in municipal debt finance, told IBD. ""I actually think it's a great place for women. Since the work is largely production-oriented and can, for the most part, be quantitatively measured, evaluations tend to be merit-based. Women do well in this type of environment, where evaluations are not wholly subjective.""At Goldman, which employed 32,400 at year-end 2012, partners make up less than 2% of the full-time staff. And it pays to be one of the partners, who owned 11.4% of the firm's stock as of November last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.The Other SideSurely, not all women who work on Wall Street would agree with Duckworth's views.Three former Goldman women are suing the bank for discrimination in pay and job promotions. This fall, a judge in Manhattan ruled that the bank must turn over complaints by female workers to lawyers representing the three plaintiffs, Bloomberg reported.In defense of Goldman, Duckworth says that in the 1980s she was lucky to work for bosses who pushed women's promotions.In 1990, then-Co-Chairman Robert Rubin — who would become Treasury secretary — asked Duckworth to form a committee to explore issues of global and cultural diversity. Over the next five years, Goldman continued to expand offices around the world, each filled with non-American employees of various beliefs and customs.While leading that committee, Duckworth also focused on domestic issues. In 1992, Goldman created a day care center inside the offices on 85 Broad St., benefiting workers with children.""I think the firm was well ahead of others in thinking about this,"" said Duckworth, 59, who is married and has four children.Duckworth, who served as co-head of municipal debt syndication at Goldman's New York headquarters, worked on large deals, selling millions of dollars' worth of government bonds to institutional investors around the world.She also gained respect inside the Wall Street shop for helping others become excellent bankers. ""Connie is a genuine leader, who not only can communicate her vision, but can also inspire others to help her realize that vision,"" said Alison Winter, a former banker at Northern Trust (NTRS). ""She is a strategic thinker, a strong negotiator, and is persistent in moving her agenda forward. Importantly, she is a risk taker, as most strong leaders are.""Before working in Goldman's New York headquarters, Duckworth ran the bond operations at the firm's Chicago branch. There, she asked two male associates to stay after work one day for a meeting. The two young college grads had been at Goldman for just six months and weren't dealing well with clients and other employees.""I called them into the office and said, 'I need you to do these specific things, otherwise we'll be having a different conversation at the end of the year,'"" Duckworth, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, said.The two men got the message. They quickly clicked with teams, superiors and clients. One of the guys went on to become partner and works in the New York office.""My most important achievement wasn't this deal or that,"" Duckworth told IBD. ""It was training and mentoring the next generation of leaders. That's the lifeblood of the firm.""In 2011 she received the Dean's Medal, the highest honor at the Wharton School.A year later, Duckworth landed the UNICEF Chicago Humanitarian Award for her effort to help Afghan female rug makers excel through the 2004 founding of the nonprofit Arzu Studio Hope.Winning CoachWinter recalls that when she was a private banking executive at Northern Trust, the Chicago-based brokerage and wealth management giant, she hired a man from Goldman to head her firm's New York office and subsequently the Northeast region.""He was a star, and he was hired into Goldman by Connie Duckworth,"" said Winter, who has since founded Braintree Holdings. ""He used to say that his two best bosses were women.""Winter and Duckworth became friends through their work at the Committee of 200, whose 400 female executives strive to help other women excel in business.The committee fosters business relationships and support among its members through an annual conference and other events. It also produces the Gender Parity Index to measure women's progress on various fronts.Duckworth helped C200 gain more influence by leading a research study on why few women selected business as a career choice.The group realized its members should visit more colleges and high schools ""to show women that one could do good and do well in business,"" Winter said.A self-described Army brat who grew up mostly in Texas, Duckworth graduated from the University of Texas with an interdisciplinary honors degree before her MBA at Wharton.Rise On The West CoastIn 1979 she joined the Los Angeles office of the energy giant Arco (which was bought by BP (BP) in 2000). While in various divisions, she did some work investing corporate cash for Arco's treasury department. ""I realized right away that I preferred dealing with money as a product rather than oil and moved to the sell side, to Goldman Sachs,"" she said.The next year, Duckworth began her Goldman career handling institutional fixed-income accounts at the firm's Los Angeles office.Several years later, Duckworth moved to New York, where she helped build the company's bond department.While learning to adapt to the fast-changing climate of fixed-income banking, she worked hard on gaining the keys to long-term success on Wall Street.Those keys?• Strengthen client relationships.• Sell the services of the firm.• Train and help the sales teams do the same.""The keys (to becoming a Goldman partner) were competency, very hard work, strong mentors and sponsors, and some luck,"" Duckworth said.As the CEO of Arzu Studio Hope, Duckworth continues to learn lessons about international business.Before forming Arzu — which means hope in the Dari language — she traveled to Afghanistan four times, then had to think about who would run day-to-day operations.At first, she was told to hire experienced Americans who would have to be paid handsome sums to work in the Asian country. In the end, Duckworth decided that Afghan citizens must take responsibility for managing the facility in Bamyan province and protecting the female weavers.In 2004, the project started with 30 weavers. Today, Arzu employs 700, including 55 Afghans who operate the facility as well as three preschools and a garden cooperative.""I thought of it as a business,"" said Duckworth. ""We took exploited women, took them out of high-risk positions in their lives and made them salaried employees with benefits.""

141,NTRS,"Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has closed the deal to acquire Citadel’s Omnium Technology Platform. A team of software development professionals and software development rights concerning the technology were also part of the agreement.Northern Trust had announced the deal in January 2018, with an aim to provide innovative solutions for alternative fund managers, asset managers, institutional investors and family offices across the world.The acquisition will likely foster in-house development of technology, which in turn, will enable the company to have greater control over technological enhancements.Peter Sanchez, Head of North America Alternative Fund Services, said, “We see significant benefits to integrating this technology team’s formidable talent with our expert operations. This integrated partnership will help us build on our record of innovation and client service.”Notably, in 2011, Northern Trust had acquired Citadel’s Omnium Hedge Fund administration business.

142,NTRS,"Investors would have to be living in a cave to have not noticed the meteoric rise and recent pullback in the price of Bitcoin over the past year. Anyone who trades has to be intrigued by (and possibly skeptical of) any widely held asset that exhibits that kind of price volatility.But is it a fad, a bubble, or a legitimate investment opportunity?Spoiler Alert: It’s all of the above.Bitcoin as a crypto-currency was born out of the ashes of the financial crisis of 2008. Initially a response to the idea of governments “printing money” – expanding the balance sheets of central banks – in order to bail out troubled financial institutions and stimulate the economy. It was an attempt to de-centralize the notion of currency.Invented by a reclusive and mysterious programmer with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the concept was to separate the control of the supply of money from the government and central banks and hand it to the market participants who use it as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Nakamoto also intended to remove the friction from financial transactions, allowing vendors and customers (or anybody) to transfer money directly to each other instantly and electronically without the participation of middlemen like banks or credit card processors.The actual identity of Nakamoto is not known, and it may in fact not be a single person. This doesn’t really matter as the source code was intentionally made available to anyone and “Nakamoto” has ceased interacting with the public or the bitcoin network.The “Blockchain”The revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin was the establishment of a distributed ledger in which transactions are verified and recorded by multiple parties in a vast peer to peer network. Every participant records and stores every transaction that has ever happened, broken down into manageable chucks of data called “blocks.” Every participant must agree that they have an identical copy of the previous set of transactions and that the new trade belongs at the end of the list.Because all participants must agree on the sequence of transactions, it would be functionally impossible for anyone with nefarious intent to add a fraudulent transaction to the chain (or delete a legitimate one) since the change would have to happen simultaneously in thousands of places. This also means that the network literally gets more secure with every transaction processed - as the list that would have to be altered grows ever larger.“Miners”The participants who process transactions and store the data of the blockchain are called Bitcoin “miners”, so named because their incentive is to be rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. The network has them process a very computationally difficult math problem to complete transactions. New bitcoins are awarded to the miners who solve the problem first. The fact that the problem gets continuously more difficult ensures that a large number of participants devotes a massive amount of computing power to the network, making it faster.With the runup in the price of bitcoin over the last 4 years, the incentive to mine coins successfully has spawned huge operations using sophisticated hardware who are competing with each other for the increasingly valuable coins. Initially, mining could be accomplished by an individual with a fast personal computer, but migrated quickly to arrays of graphics cards that could solve the problems faster and then to dedicated mining “rigs” which are commercially available and designed for the singular task of mining bitcoin and other crypto currencies.The electricity to run all of these powerful computers and also the air-conditioning to cool them is the biggest component of the cost structure for miners. As the arms race for the fastest computers continues, mitigating the energy costs associated with mining is the miner’s holy grail.So How Can You Invest in Bitcoin?There are many ways to gain investment exposure to crypto currencies:Buy BitcoinsThere are now numerous online marketplaces that allow you to buy bitcoin (and numerous crypto currencies) fairly easily. You deposit U.S dollars and once the fund transfer is verified, you can buy bitcoin, participate in the price appreciation or depreciation and turn your bitcoin holdings back into dollars whenever you wish.Buy Bitcoin FuturesFutures contracts on Bitcoin are traded on both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and the CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report). Trading bitcoin futures allows an investor to participate in price appreciation (or depreciation – they can be sold as well) without any risk of interacting with an upstart exchange. Trades on both the CME and CBOE are backed by the assets of extremely well capitalized clearing corporations, so there is no risk of the exchange being hacked and losing crypto currency as has happened in the past – albeit infrequently – with online crypto exchanges.The advent of listed futures contracts also provided traders with the first simple way to short the price of bitcoin, and many have done so. The decline from $19,000 to $7,000 over the past six months is widely attributed to the existence of liquid, shortable bitcoin securities. This is actually healthy for the market since instruments that allow market participants to easily express both long and short sentiment tend to restrain bubble-type price activity.Buy Blockchain CompaniesMany companies now sell equipment and software designed specifically for mining crypto currencies. Recall that only the miners with the fastest and most efficient technology are able to process transactions quickly and efficiently enough to profit from the activity. Miners are constantly in search of processors and peripheral hardware that put them at the front of the line when new coins are minted and issued.From upstart companies producing equipment designed for the sole purpose of mining to more traditional hardware manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) whose existing products are commonly used for mining, a tremendous amount of hardware is being purchased and utilized for blockchain-related activity.Buy the Forward ThinkersIt is commonly believed that the real value in bitcoin is not necessarily the price of the coins themselves (which need to exist to compensate the processors on the network), but in the blockchain itself. Future applications of the distributed ledger technology could be used in any field where data needs to be transmitted electronically and stored securely.Financial transactions, legal documents and medical records are obvious candidates for blockchain processing.Some traditional finance companies including Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) have devoted significant resources to developing systems for blockchain transactions and will be the first to benefit if and when the technology is applied to other areas beyond currencies.Managed ExposureStay tuned to this same space Tuesday for a look at one new ETF that seeks to provide investors a one-stop shop for all of these blockchain investment concepts. I’ll be at the New York Stock Exchange to discuss the product with the founder and manager of the fund and will report back tomorrow.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

143,NTRS,"With a view to bolster its operations, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has expanded its asset management unit’s product offerings to include private credit for middle-market companies. The news was reported by Bloomberg.Brian Van Elslander, who previously was part of securities division at Wells Fargo, has been appointed to lead the business. Per Kristi Mitchem, CEO of Wells Fargo Asset Management (“WFAM”), debt offering to middle level corporate clients is a key strength for the bank. Through this expansion, Wells Fargo will able to better exploit its advantage and tap a larger share of middle-market corporate clients.With $497 billion assets under management as of Mar 31, 2018, WFAM remains focused on reinforcing its position as a diversified asset manager and drive solid growth. On its 2018 investor day, Wells Fargo mentioned plans to broaden its reach in multi-asset solutions, systematic along with alternatives and private markets.Since the outbreak of the fake account scandal in September 2016, several divisions of Wells Fargo have been closely scrutinized by regulators. Per the latest quarterly filing, the bank’s investment management segment is undergoing a review to assess whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers.Recently, Wells Fargo received the final approval for $142 million settlement to compensate customers harmed by the bank’s unauthorized account opening scandal. However, it still has to face a number pending legal proceedings, which might affect its financials.Nevertheless, Wells Fargo have been taking remedial measures and initiatives to stay afloat.

144,NTRS,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

145,NTRS,"At the end of the two-day FOMC meeting on Wednesday, as expected by the markets, the Fed increased the interest rates to 1.75-2%. Notably, the last time interest rate had topped 2% was in September 2008.The central bank’s signaling of two more rate hikes this year was the major highlight. This takes the number of expected hikes to four in 2018 from its prior outlook of three.In the statement, the Fed said, “The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”The minor changes in the statement clearly indicated the Fed’s more hawkish stance on monetary policy. While increasing the interest rates, the Fed indicated that the economy is growing at a ‘solid’ pace, a change from May 2018 statement of economic growth being ‘moderate.’The changes in the Fed’s statement show that its policy will not likely be “accommodative” any longer.What Led to the Rise in Number of Rate Hikes?You might be wondering what changed in the few months that paved the way for increase in the number of hikes this year.Well, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, after the two-day policy meeting said, “The decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape. Most people who want to find jobs are finding them.”The two key mandates for rising rates — full employment level and inflation of 2% — have already been almost fulfilled. The current unemployment rate of 3.8% is close to the full employment level. Also, inflation data (moving toward the Fed’s target) supports a further rise in rates.Apart from these, a slew of favorable economic data, including increase in household spending, improvement in economic activities, stimulus from the tax cuts, rise in consumer confidence and better-than-expected GDP numbers, support this hawkish stance.Also, the central bank now projects economic growth at the rate of 2.8% for 2018, up from the previous expectation of 2.7%. Notably, the growth rate is anticipated to be 2.4% in 2019 and 2.0% in 2020, unchanged from the earlier guidance.Further, based on the updated economic projections, the Fed expects inflation to be 2.1% this year, above its target of 2%. The unemployment rate in 2018 is predicted to be 3.6%, down from the prior forecast of 3.8%. Also, it is estimated to decline to 3.5% in both 2019 and 2020, down from the previous projection of 3.6% for both years.Banks Benefit From Rising Rate EnvironmentThe banking industry benefits the most from the rising rates. Banks derive benefits from a steep yield curve (widespread between short and long-terms rates). A rise in short-term rates (to which deposits are tied) helps banks charge more on loans (to which long-term rates are tied), if the long-term rates are higher than the short-term ones. So, banks gain from rising interest rates only if the increase in long-term rates is higher than the short-term ones.Also, rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy. And this implies that the credit quality is improving, which is great for banks' profitability as well. In addition, banks are expected to gain from easing of stringent regulatory restrictions and lower tax rates.These factors have largely led to the rally in the finance sector, benefiting bank stocks the most. Over the past year, the Major Banks and Banks & Thrifts have gained 14.5% and 12.4%, respectively. Both outpaced the 7.8% rise of the Zacks Finance sector.One-Year Price PerformanceAlso, as the Fed indicates an increase in number of rate hikes this year, the rally for bank stocks will likely continue. So, if you want to be part of this rally, this is the right time to invest in a few stocks that have strong fundamentals and solid growth prospects.Picking the Winning Bank StocksWhile all banks will benefit from rising rates, to pick a handful of these for your investment portfolio is not an easy task. To make this daunting work somewhat easy, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.Through it, we have shortlisted bank stocks with expected 2018 earnings growth rate of 30% or more and market capitalization greater than $5 billion.

(CBSH  -  Free Report), based in Kansas City, MO, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has market cap of $7 billion.

This Columbus, GA -based company’s earnings are expected to grow at the rate of 41.5% for 2018.Webster Financial Corporation (WBS  -  Free Report), headquartered in Waterbury, CT, has a Zacks Rank #2 and market cap of $6.1 billion.

The company’s current-year earnings are expected to grow at the rate of 33.4%.Road Ahead for the FedThe Fed officials continue to project three rate hikes next year while reducing the number of forecasted interest rate rise to one from two for 2020.At present, the central bank seems to be at crossroads as it tries to keep a balance between rising interest rates and driving economic growth. Powell said, “I think we are far enough away now though that the risks are kind of balanced. I think it’s more just, we are just looking at the economy and what does it need and how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong and try to keep inflation near 2 percent.”For banks, an improving economy and rising interest rates are beneficial. Thus, this will definitely support their profitability in the upcoming quarters.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

147,NTRS,"In order to compete with the startup lenders, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is mulling over ideas to simplify the credit and debit card pricing method for small companies. The news was reported by Bloomberg.The changes to be made are related to small business that process nearly $100,000 per year and deal with a complex pricing policy that require them to enter lengthy contracts and go through confusing rate tables. Also, the prices charged vary from customer to customer.Pressure has been created on traditional banks by startups like Square and Stripe that are consistently capturing the market on the back of their simple pricing method and technology. Wells Fargo has planned to introduce digital modes of applying for payment-processing capabilities for its customers.Danny Peltz, head of treasury management and merchant services at Wells Fargo said, “This industry is going through some structural changes -- not withstanding anything that’s happening at the bank -- and that’s driving our decision-making more so than anything else.”Recently, the bank was charged with yet another lawsuit. A federal lawsuit was filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, a big insurance company, for infringement of the latter’s patented technology.USAA has alleged Wells Fargo of violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal, Wells Fargo has been hit with a number of probes. These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated. However, the bank has diligently been taking remedial measures and initiatives to stay afloat. Also, lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 6.5% over the past six months versus the industry’s growth of nearly 1%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed 6.4% upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

148,NTRS,"Already grappling with legal issues, the Wall Street giant — Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) — has been slapped with another federal lawsuit. A federal lawsuit has been filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, the big insurance company, for infringement on the latter’s patented technology.The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court in Marshall, TX. USAA has accused the bank for violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.USAA demands fine for infringement damages, including interest and attorneys' fees.Story So FarFor the past year, USAA has been asking hundreds of financial institutions for licensing its RDC technology. Finally, it took the first legal action by filing the lawsuit against Wells Fargo. Per this suit, in August 2007, USAA had requested Wells Fargo to negotiate a licensing deal, which was ignored by the bank. Therefore, USAA demanded reinforcing of its patents, along with damages. Notably, the company holds about 50 patents associated with its mobile deposit of checks.“Wells Fargo is one of the biggest adopters of remote deposit capture,” said Nathan McKinley, USAA’s head of Corporate Development, which includes commercialization of the company’s intellectual property. “We believe they are leveraging the technology to improve their bottom line, and they failed to take a license,” McKinley noted.Per the lawsuit, 21 million active mobile-banking customers of Wells Fargo are accessing this technology, as of February.Spokesperson for Wells Fargo refrained from comments on the pending litigation.The lawsuit states its “improper for Wells Fargo to use, without permission, patented technologies that USAA has spent immense resources to invent, develop, implement and perfect.”The aforementioned mobile-deposit technology was initiated by USAA in 2009. “We developed mobile check deposit technology using our members’ money to help military families because their lifestyle often made getting to the bank difficult,” McKinley said. “We believe the industry has been able to save billions using our mobile check deposit technology. We also believe the industry is aware USAA developed it,” he further added.Bottom LineCurrently, Wells Fargo is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past six months underlines investors’ disappointment.

149,NTRS,"With a view to cut costs, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with Flagstar Bancorp (FBC  -  Free Report) to divest all of its branches in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. While the financial details were not disclosed, the deal is expected to close in the last quarter of 2018.The 52 branches in consideration, including four branches of Wisconsin, comprise about $2.3 billion in deposits. Also, 490 employees working across the branches will continue to work with Flagstar.Post this deal, Wells Fargo will cease to have retail banking presence in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. However, the bank will continue providing commercial banking, wealth management and retail brokerage services across the region.The transaction is in line with the Wall Street biggie’s target to reduce branches by about 800 by the end of 2020 to combat high legal expenses. Also, shift in preferences of consumers to online and mobile banking marks as another key reason behind the closures.Troubles for Wells Fargo had begun from its retail banking segment in September 2016, when its employees had opened unauthorized accounts on behalf of its clients to fulfil sales targets. Following this, scandals in different areas of business had come to light, which put Wells Fargo under strict supervision of regulators.In May 2018, Wells Fargo had disclosed an impressive cost-control plan to help it deal with persistent legal expenses.

150,NTRS,"The earnings season had a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far. Though the results have not been able to impress investors markedly, hopes are high that the industry will soon regain momentum.The banks that released earnings reported higher revenues supported by improved loan balances and higher interest rates. However, lower mortgage and trading revenues impacted the fee income to some extent.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, earnings for the major banks, accounting for nearly one-third of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500, are up 7.2% from the prior-year quarter while revenues are 1.9% higher.Earnings releases are coming in thick with U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Oct 18, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these three Major Regional Banks when they report third-quarter earnings.U.S. Bancorp is expected to report year-over-year improvement in revenues supported by higher net interest income (NII) on the back of loan growth. Some support is expected from the Mortgage Banking business as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $215 billion, relatively stable year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Bancorp’s current-quarter earnings of 88 cents reflects a 4.5% rise year over year.However, the bank’s aim to be technologically advanced should keep costs high.

Rise in loans along with favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s NII. Fee income is likely to remain stable due to lower volume of M&A and equity issuance activities during the quarter, offset by expectations of higher trust income.M&T Bank’s investments in operational infrastructure and technology is likely to keep expenses escalated in the to-be-reported quarter.

151,NTRS,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 18, are expected to reflect a rise in C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees — one of the major revenue components.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through its C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees of $493 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 9.3%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the second quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s Q3 performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earnings assets of $111.5 billion reflects a marginal decline from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust should record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Rise Modestly: Given the increase in overall foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility, as well as higher volumes in the third quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading will likely increase for the quarter.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a slight increase in expenses.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Northern Trust will be able to beat earnings estimates in the third quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Moreover, activities of the company during the third quarter were unable to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.12 remained stable in the last seven days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 3.6%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.35 billion reflects an improvement of 11.2% from the prior year quarter.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

153,NTRS,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). The company’s escalating expenses are likely to impact its bottom-line growth. Also, rising nonperforming assets remain a concern. However, its strong capital position isa tailwind.Northern Trust missed earnings estimates by 4.8% in second-quarter 2017. Results reflected higher expenses and a decline in non-interest income. Nevertheless, the quarter witnessed rise in assets under management and assets under custody.The company's shares have remained flat year to date compared to the industry's rally of 4.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northern Trust’s current-year earnings has been revised nearly 1% downward over the past 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Northern Trust’s investments in technology have led to higher compensation and software expenses. Over the last five years (ended 2016) the company’s expenses have seen a compound annual growth rate of 1.4%. Further, the trend was witnessed in the first six months of 2017 as well. This mounting expense base is likely to deter bottom-line growth in the near term.At the end of the second quarter, the company’s nonperforming assets (NPAs) amounted to about $166.7 million. Such elevated levels of NPAs do not bode well for the company as they impact the net interest income. Further, it also increases expenses as a result of the collection efforts involved.  However, Northern Trust’s strong capital position supports its capital deployment activities. For third-quarter 2017, the company raised its common stock dividend by 10.5%. These steady capital deployment activities are likely to enhance shareholders’ confidence in the stock.Better-Ranked Finance StocksPeople's Utah Bancorp’s (PUB  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has beenrevised 2.9% upward, over the last 30 days.

Also, the figure came in 25% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Impressive growth in revenues aided by easing margin pressure drove the better-than-expected results. Further, the quarter recorded growth in loans, though deposits balance remained stable. Credit quality metrics also improved. Rise in operating expenses and decline in non-interest income were the undermining factors.Income from continuing operations available to common shareholders was $301 million, up 17.6% year over year.Revenue Improves, Costs UpAdjusted total revenue (net of interest expense) came in at $1.42 billion in the quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues climbed 2.4% from the prior-year quarter figure.Regions Financial reported adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income from continuing operations of $502 million, up 4.8% year over year.On a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, net interest income was $904 million, up 4.0% year over year. Net interest margin (on an FTE basis) expanded 17 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.32% in the quarter. Elevated market interest rates and favorable credit-related interest recoveries drove the results. These increases were partially offset by reduced average loan balances.Regions Financial reported slight decline in non-interest income to come in at $525 million. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income remained stable year over year.Non-interest expense edged down around 1% year over year to $909 million. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses rose 1.1% year over year to $899 million. An increase in salaries and benefits, FDIC insurance assessments, professional, legal and regulatory, along with furniture and equipment expenses, led to the rise. These were mostly mitigated by reduced provision for unfunded credit losses, marketing and other real estate expenses.Balance Sheet StrengthAs of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were down 2.3% year over year to $80.1 billion. Further, total deposits came in at $97.5 billion, almost stable year over year. Total funding costs were 34 basis points (bps).As of Jun 30, 2017, low-cost deposits, as a percentage of average deposits, were 93.0% compared with 92.5% as of Jun 30, 2016.

Also, non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, as a percentage of loans, came in at 1.03%, down 22 bps from the year-ago quarter.Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans, net of unearned income was 1.30%, down 11 bps from the year-earlier quarter. In addition, provision for loan losses was $48 million, plunging 33.3% year over year.  Additionally, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans came in at 0.34%, down 1 bp. The company’s total business services criticized loans declined 10.5% year over year.Strong Capital PositionRegions Financial’s estimated ratios remained well above the regulatory requirements under the Basel III capital rules. As of Jun 30, 2017, Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) and Tier 1 capital ratio were estimated at 11.3% and 12.2%, respectively, compared to 10.8% and 11.7% in the prior-year quarter.During second-quarter 2017, Regions Financial repurchased 9.1 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $125 million and announced $84 million in dividends to common shareholders. This reflects 70% of earnings returned to shareholders.Our ViewpointRegions Financial’s favorable funding mix, attractive core business and revenue diversification strategies will likely yield profitable earnings in the upcoming quarters. We also remain optimistic on the company's branch consolidation plan and reduction of $300 million in expenses by 2018 and additional $100 million by 2019, in a bid to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60%.Additionally, steady capital deployment measures will continue to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. However, escalating expenses and decline in non-interest income remain concerns. Regions Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteCurrently, Regions Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, total revenue was up 37% year over year.Net interest income (NII) came in at $757 million on a FTE basis, up 47% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was driven by an increase in average earnings assets, along with an expansion of 25 basis points (bps) in net interest margin (NIM), to 3.31%.Non-interest income climbed 20% year over year to $325 million. The upsurge was due to growth in almost all components of income.Non-interest expense surged 33% year over year to $694 million. The increase was stemmed by rise in mostly all components of expenses.

Management projects to implement all FirstMerit-related cost savings by third-quarter 2017.Average balance sheet growth is estimated over 20%, driven mainly by the FirstMerit acquisition. On a period-end basis, loan growth is anticipated in the range of 4–6%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35–55 basis points, while provision expense is expected to continue to normalize.Excluding certain items, the effective tax rate for 2017 is estimated in the range of 24–27%.Our ViewpointHuntington reported an encouraging quarter. The company has a solid franchise in the Midwest and is focused on capitalizing on growth opportunities.

Results include certain one-time items.Margins Improve, Non-interest Income Falls, Costs EscalateTotal revenue of $1.33 billion was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported figure was slightly up year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $350.4 million was up 14% year over year. This was driven by increased levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin (NIM) was 1.28%, up 12 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates and reduced premium amortization. The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable mix shift in earning assets.Non-interest income declined 4% from the year-ago quarter to $979.7 million. Fall in foreign exchange trading income, other operating income and treasury management fees were the primary reasons for this decrease. These were partially offset by elevated trust, investment, along with rise in security commissions and trading income.Non-interest expenses were up 1% year over year to $937.4 million in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an elevation in mostly all components of expenses.Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Jun 30, 2017, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody increased 16% year over year to $7.38 trillion, while total assets under management rose 14% to $1.03 trillion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $178.8 million, down 21% year over year.

The new dividend will be paid on Oct 1 to holders as of Sep 1, 2017.The company’s board of directors also approved a new common stock repurchase authorization of up to 9.5 million shares, replacing the authorization approved in Apr 2015.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the consistent growth in assets under custody, revenues and an improving credit quality to some extent. Moreover, positive impact of rising rates was visible. Though increase in expenses and lower non-interest income might pose a threat to the company’s profitability, anticipated lesser regulations might act as a tailwind.Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteCurrently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

158,NTRS,"Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Chicago, IL-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to a rise in revenues. However, this was partly offset by escalating expenses.Notably, this positive performance resulted in an appreciation of the company’s share price.  In the second quarter, the stock gained around 12.3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, Northern Trust has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Northern Trust’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Northern Trust doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.24. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrust Revenues to Witness Improvement: The equity markets across the globe displayed a decent improvement in the second quarter. Both the MSCI EAFE Index (measuring international equity performance) and the S&P 500 Index gained.Notably, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the first quarter, the company will likely be able to record growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Northern Trust should have recorded an increase in NII. However, a slowdown in loan growth during the quarter will have a marginal adverse impact on interest income.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Fall: Given the decrease in foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility, as well as mixed volumes in the second quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading are likely to have deteriorated during the quarter on lower transactions.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a slight rise in expenses.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

159,NTRS,"On May 28, we issued an updated research report on The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report). The company’s cost-containment efforts to drive operational efficiency along with steady loan and deposit growth indicate its upside potential. However, lack of loan diversification remains a concern.The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.6%.In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up slightly to $10.54 for the current year. Hence, PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Further, shares of this banking giant have recorded a year-to-date return of 3.7% against slight decline for the industry.PNC Financial’s efforts to reduce expenses keep us encouraged. The company successfully realized its continuous improvement savings program (CIP) goals for the last three years (ended 2017) of about $1.25 billion. For 2018, management has a CIP target of $250 million. The company's consistent focus on core expense management might help generate positive operating leverage in the quarters ahead.The company’s strong balance sheet position enables it to strengthen business through strategic initiatives. In 2017, PNC Financial acquired companies, which helped it expand product offering and presence. Thus, the company’s bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments.With one of the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry, PNC Financial continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. A rising rate environment has helped ease margin pressure greatly, in turn boosting its net interest income. Further, the company’s fee income depicted upward movement in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue increasing with the execution of strategic initiatives.However, a significant portion of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio comprises commercial loans. Such high exposure to commercial loans depicts lack of diversification, which can be risky for the company amid a challenging economy and competitive markets.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has witnessed an 5.1% upward estimate revision for current-year earnings in the last 60 days. Over the past six months, the company’s share price has been up 9.4%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

160,NTRS,"In the Q1 earnings season, the Finance sector turned out to be one of the best performers. Particularly, benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest-rate scenario have well positioned the banking industry. Moreover, lower commercial tax rate are likely to further boost banks’ profitability.In addition, relieving banks from some of the stringent requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act has made the companies optimistic of future earnings growth and raised investors’ sentiments as well. So, we thought of bringing up a stock from the sector that reflects strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.Particularly, Synovus Financial Corp.

161,NTRS,"Minutes from the latest FOMC meet indicated that the Fed is set to hike interest rates gradually this year. However, a June hike is almost certain. The committee is of the view that broadly encouraging economic conditions, even as inflation nears the 2% level, would make conditions appropriate for a rate hike “soon.”Further, tight labor market conditions and growing wages make the conditions ideal for gradually hiking interest rates. Economists largely believe that there might be three or four rate hikes in 2018. Under conditions in which interest rates are likely to remain high, investing in financial stocks seems prudent.June Hike in the OffingIn the recently concluded Fed meet on May 2, the Federal Open Market Committee jointly agreed to hold the interest rate steady. However, the committee acknowledged rising levels of inflation. The members noted that on a 12-month basis, overall inflation as well as inflation for items excluding food and energy, inched close to 2%.The minutes from the meeting, indicated that though the rate hikes would be gradual this year, a hike is inevitable in June. This is because most of the members stated that it would “soon be appropriate” to hike rates. Further, the minutes also stated that an upsurge in inflation would prove to be helpful.Moreover, the committee believes that gradual increments in federal funds rate would sustain the current level of economic growth. Under tight labor market conditions and inflation levels near the targeted rate of 2%, a gradual path toward raising rates would prove to be consistent with overall economic growth.Economists vehemently predict a possible rate hike by the Fed in its Jun 13 policy meeting. Notaby, CME’s FedWatch Tool predict a 100% probability of a hike in interest rate levels in June.Patrick Harker Expects a Spate of Rate Hikes This YearOn May 21, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker stated that rising inflation levels in the United States should encourage the Fed to hike interest rates by two or maybe three more times this year. He further stated that the next hike could take place as early as in June.He reasoned that since inflation is fast closing in on the targeted 2% level, a hike in interest rate should not be delayed. Notably, the PCE price index rose to an annual rate of 2% in March from 1.7% in February.During the monetary tightening in March, when the Fed introduced a quarter point hike in the rates to 1.5-1.75%, Harker estimated two hikes this year. However, given the acceleration in inflation levels and the absence of any “slack in the labor markets,” he supports a third hike which he feels would bode well for the economy.4 Hot ChoicesConsistent economic growth, robust labor market conditions and rising wages have raised the possibility of a rate hike in June. Further, minutes from Fed’s latest meeting show that a vast majority of the committee members support the decision to soon hike interest rates.In this context, we have selected four financial stocks that are expected to gain from these factors.

162,NTRS,"The days of increased regulatory scrutiny are over for U.S. financial stocks. The Congress approved a plan on May 22 to scale down stringent banking regulations or the Dodd-Franck act undertaken in the height of the 2008 financial crisis.While the move sounds great for the entire banking industry, small-cap banks should actually jump in joy. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained 0.6% on May 22 while SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report) advanced 0.4%. Direxion Regional Banks Bull 3X (DPST  -  Free Report) gained about 1.53% on May 22.Inside the Dodd-Frank LawsThe Dodd-Frank Act is a U.S. federal law that entrusts the government with the regulation of the financial industry. The focus of the law was to cut back on uncontrolled lending and avoid the situation where tax-payers' money is needed to bail out large financial institutions. The Act increased the operating expenses of financial institutions given the rise in compliance costs. Further, stringent capital requirements led banks to curb investments.Why Is the New Rule Especially Beneficial for Small Banks?From his campaign days, President Trump addressed the Dodd-Frank regulatory revamp as needlessly strict on smaller banks.The bill lowers federal oversight of banks between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, and “eases lending, capital and trading rules for smaller lenders,” per Reuters. Now, since the days of increased regulatory scrutiny seem to be phasing out, regional banking stocks are likely to be performing at peak levels.But big bank lobbyists and analysts are of the opinion that the latest easing will do little to comfort the stringency pertaining to the nation’s largest lenders. Large banks lobbied a lot to increase that oversight limit to $500 billion, or resort to a more lenient approach to big bank scrutiny, but small banks strived to cap the threshold at $250 billion, according to Reuters (read: Play Banking Bonanza with These ETFs in Trump World).Most importantly, the new bill relaxed capital, lending and trading rules of the banks on the basis of asset-size limits, not by firm type or activities. As a result, big banks, many of those that have size to tune of $10 billion, failed to qualify for the rule.Against this backdrop, investors can surely dip their toe in regional and community bank ETFs and stocks.ETFs to BuySPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report)The fund looks to track the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index.

163,NTRS,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) can be a solid bet now on the back of its leading global position in completed mergers and acquisitions in 2017. The company’s strong client activity amid volatile markets is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Organic growth, cost management and steady capital-deployment activities continue to drive Goldman’s growth. However, litigation issues remain concerns.Expense management and business diversification aided the company to gain 6.3% compared with 32.3% growth of the industry.Further, the company’s earnings estimates moved 6.6% upward, for the current year, over the past 60 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past few years, Goldman has been benefiting from its successful expense-reduction initiatives. Though expenses have been volatile, the figure declined significantly in 2016, but increased 3% in 2017 and 21% in first-quarter 2018. The company is focused on improving efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Notably, Goldman’s $5 billion of growth initiatives is expected to drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pre-tax earnings, at a 30% marginal ROE.While overall revenues have been affected by unfavorable market conditions over the last few quarters, Goldman remains well positioned for growth, given its strong investment banking operations and solid client franchise. These, in turn, are likely to help the company leverage on the improving environment.Furthermore, the key source of the company’s earnings stability is its business diversification. Within traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has higher chances of sustaining growth than many other banks, which have exited some of these areas.Driven by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital-deployment activities. Its 2017 capital plan won regulatory approval that includes share buybacks and an increase in quarterly common stock dividend, along with issuance and redemption of other capital securities. In April 2018, the company increased its common stock dividend by 6.7%.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

164,NTRS,"The long-time demand of banks to scale back stringent regulations is finally a reality. The House passed a crucial bill easing some provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that were put in place as safeguard against repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.The House passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 258 to 159, promising it to be beneficial for small and mid-sized banks. It would now be presented to President Donald Trump for signing, with the Senate already having passed the legislation in March.Highlights of the BillPerhaps the most significant relief from the bill is the reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill will eventually raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.Banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later. This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 38.Therefore, banks including SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief. These banks will not be required to undergo annual stress tests or submit so-called ‘living wills,’ both necessitated as measures to plan for financial disaster. So, this will eventually lower regulatory compliance costs.Further, the move will likely lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Other than this, the bill will lower the amount of capital required to be held by the custodian banks. The bill will allow these companies to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately send it to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) custodian banks — State Street (STT  -  Free Report), BNY Mellon and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) — will be the major gainers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempted from complying with the Volker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading. The bill also eases mortgage loan data reporting requirements for several banks and credit unions as well as relaxes rules on what type of real estate loans smaller community banks can make.Additionally, the legislation will add new safeguards for student loan borrowers and necessitate credit reporting companies like Equifax and TransUnion to provide free credit monitoring services.Is Dodd-Frank Hurting Banks’ Financials?The Dodd-Frank Act has been criticized by small and medium banks for tougher rules that have made it difficult of them to do business and remain profitable. But in reality, did the law actually hurt their profitability?Well, if we go by the figures, banks have continued to earn significant profits. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported record earnings of $56 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 27.5% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6.1 billion, 17.7% above the prior-year quarter level.While one can say that improving economy and higher interest rates have supported banks, strict rules have also played their part to some extent in aiding the financials.Monitoring by regulatory bodies has helped banks to keep a check on their operations and maintain sufficient capital cushion to avoid another financial crisis. By establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to oversee credit cards, mortgages and other financial products as well as other regulatory bodies to check for signs of instability, the Dodd-Frank Act provided stability to the banking industry.Road AheadThe bill is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations. Still, it is the most important step to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth (as seen by many) and lending activities.But the legislation is of little help to some of the nation’s biggest banks (in term of assets) like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), PNC Financial, Goldman and Wells Fargo. Notably, further discussions seem to be going on about lowering capital requirements and easing other restrictions on these banks.Later this month, the banking regulators are expected to release a proposal to weaken the Volker Rule for big banks. Further, the CFPB interim head has significantly scaled back the agency’s activities and stopped probes into finance companies.Thus, in the coming days, more regulatory easing is expected. These will definitely help the banks to further improve profitability. Also, shareholders might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

165,NTRS,"Longtime CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) — Lloyd C. Blankfein — is likely to retire by the end of 2018, per an article by The New York Times. Aged 63, Blankfein has served Goldman Sachs since 2006 and has been successful in keeping the bank afloat in difficult times like the financial crisis. Over the recent months, he has been setting the ground for his exit.Per the article, Blankfien is likely to be replaced by current president of the Goldman Sachs, David M. Solomon, who has already began shaking the senior management team. He was appointed as president in March 2018, which had initiated doubts of his succession as the CEO at the time.So far in his term, Solomon has helped strengthen the company’s investment banking business by making it one of the leading advisors on corporate mergers and acquisitions. Also, lately, he has been focused on improving other potential divisions such as trading unit and consumer banking.Blankfein is not the only person to be leaving the Wall Street giant this year. Goldman Sachs’s co-president, Harvey M. Schwartz, who was being considered as another potential candidate for running the company, announced plans to retire. Also, recently, co-heads of the trading unit announced their retirement plans.Blankfein is likely to step down alongside these employees at an annual dinner in December. Citing people familiar with the matter, The New York Times noted that the expected time of transition might change.Goldman Sachs’s well-diversified business, along with its solid investment banking operations, bolster its financial position.

166,NTRS,"Ratings of Webster Financial Corporation (WBS  -  Free Report) and its bank subsidiary, Webster Bank N.A., was recently confirmed by Moody’s Investors Service. The outlook has remained stable.Wester Bank’s long and short-term deposits have been rated as A1/Prime-1 while standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) is rated a3 and its counterparty risk assessments are A2(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Webster Financial has a long-term issuer rating and a senior unsecured rating of Baa1. Further, the company’s shelf registration was rated (P)Baa1 for senior unsecured, (P)Baa1 for subordinate, (P)Baa2 for cumulative preferred stock and (P)Baa3 for non-cumulative preferred stock.Per Moody’s, the ratings affirmation reflects the company’s sustainable business model and ability to maintain credit quality with support from robust liquidity position and improving credit metrics.Webster has a strong deposit base accounting for about 116% of gross loans. Such impressive deposits balance enables the bank to depend less on funding from external sources. Further, the company holds liquid assets of about 25% of tangible banking assets.Also, Moody’s finds Webster’s asset quality to be strong as indicated by ration of non-performing loans to total loans of 1.5% (as of Mar 31, 2018). Also, slowdown in loan growth is considered a positive.  Further, the rating agency noted that the rising interest rates continue to benefit its bottom line as the company’s revenues are dependent on spread income, and its balance sheet remains asset-sensitive.The adjusted tangible common equity as a percentage of risk-weighted assets has been calculated as 10.9% for Webster’s as of Dec 31, 2017. Moody’s finds the ratio to match the similarly-rated peer median. However, its current capital levels limit upward rating pressure.  Ratings of Webster can be upgraded if it delivers a sustained improvement in capital and an above-average asset quality performance. On the flip side, a downward rating in its standalone BCA is plausible on account of aggressive capital actions and a reduction in liquid banking assets.Shares of Webster Financial have gained 32.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.2%.Currently, Webster Financial carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

167,NTRS,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has landed in trouble again thanks to its employees, who reportedly modified or added false information related to corporate customers, without their knowledge, in order to meet a regulatory deadline. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Despite strict regulatory scrutiny and promises made by Wells Fargo to improve internal controls, disclosure of such misconducts continues to shake investors’ confidence in the stock. Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 1.5% in yesterday’s trading session. Per the report, the scandal happened between late 2017 and first few months of 2018. Employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information such as birth dates, social security numbers and addresses of clients during that period.Citing people familiar with the matter, Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo has been facing a Jun 30 deadline to comply with a regulatory order related to anti-money laundering controls.  In an internal investigation, Wells Fargo became aware of these misdoings. The matter is currently under investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.A spokeswoman at Wells Fargo said, ""This matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.""Last week, Wells Fargo had launched an ad-campaign — Re-Established — with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices.However, findings of these sort continue to test regulators tolerance toward Wells Fargo’s wrongdoings. In its Investors’ Day held on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the regulatory cap on its assets till the first part of 2019. This disclosure might extend that to an even longer time.Also, the company’s bottom-line remains under pressure due to unstable revenues.

168,NTRS,"With strong fundamentals and organic growth prospects, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) appears to be an attractive pick now.

Though expenses have witnessed a volatile trend in the last few years, the figure declined significantly in 2016, but increased 3% in 2017 and 21% in first-quarter 2018. Notably, the company carried out an expense initiative during the first half of 2016, which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $700 million. It continued this initiative in the second half of 2016 as well, and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. Notably, Goldman’s $5 billion of growth initiatives is expected to drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pre-tax earnings, at a 30% marginal ROE.Diversification: While overall revenues have been affected by unfavorable market conditions in the last few quarters, Goldman remains well positioned for growth, backed by its sound investment banking operations and solid client franchise. In traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has higher chances of sustaining growth than many other banks.Notably, Goldman has been undertaking initiatives to fortify the GS Bank’s business by acquiring the online deposit platform of GE Capital Bank in April 2016. It also launched a digital consumer lending platform — Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from its exposure to the fast growing exchange-traded funds (ETF) market.Steady Capital Deployment: Goldman remains focused on managing its capital levels efficiently and has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital-deployment activities. The company’s 2017 capital plan won regulatory approval that includes share buybacks and an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend, along with the issuance and redemption of other capital securities. In April 2018, the company increased its common stock dividend by 6.7%.Stock is Undervalued: Goldman has a P/E ratio of 10.38 compared to the industry average of 15.66. Further, the company has a P/B ratio of 1.26 compared to the industry average of 1.87. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Bottom LineOrganic growth, expense management, robust capital position and steady capital-deployment activities continue to support Goldman’s growth opportunities. Furthermore, business diversification remains a key strength for earnings stability.Other Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

Shares have added about 1.4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NTRS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Northern Trust Q1 Earnings and Revenues Increase Y/YDriven by top-line strength, Northern Trust’s first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.58 compared favorably with $1.09 recorded in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.42.Higher revenues and credit provisions were the positives. In addition, the quarter witnessed rise in AUC and AUM. Moreover, credit metrics marked a significant improvement. However, escalating operating expenses remained a major drag.Net income came in at $381.6 million compared with $276.1 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Margins & Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateTotal revenues of $1.48 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 billion. Also, the figure improved 15% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $392.7 million was up 8% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher NIM.NIM was 1.38%, up 3 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rate, partially offset by rise in premium amortization and a balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 17% from the year-ago quarter to $1.09 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees, other operating income and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 11% year over year to $995.3 million in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an increase in all components of expenses.Improvement in AUC & AUMAs of Mar 31, 2018, Northern Trust’s total AUC increased 14% year over year to $8.111 trillion, while total AUM rose 16% to $1.16 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $147.8 million, down 22% year over year.

All ratios exceeded the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares for $263.2 million at an average price of $104.51 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.OutlookBeginning with 2018, premium amortization is expected to be within $10-$12 million range. In first-quarter 2018, the company adopted a new method with one-time true-up to align the remaining amortization.Based on a portfolio of initiatives, management anticipates realizing $250 million in expense run-rate savings by 2020.

171,NTRS,"On May 15, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumped to touch its highest point since 2011. The immediate trigger for this jump was an increase in April retail sales. Data of this nature was indicative of the U.S. consumer’s strong purchasing power. Further, reports emerged that trade tensions between the United States and China were likely to continue. Trade-related tensions are likely to boost prices higher, which would depress bonds and boost yields. Though such an occurrence could weigh on broader markets, financials stocks, particularly banks would be benefited. This is because a spike in rates increases the yield spread for banks. Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point. Benchmark Yield Climbs as Retail Sales IncreaseOn Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased by 7.5 basis points to 3.070%. This is the highest level achieved since July 2011. It also marks the biggest single-day increase since March 1. Further, the yield also hit an intra-day peak of 3.093%. Notably, the day’s gains lifted the yield spread between the 10-year and 2-year rate to 48.5 basis points.The immediate trigger for the jump in the benchmark yield was bullish retail sales data for April. Retail sales increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% in April from March, according to the Commerce Department. March sales were, in fact, revised to show a 0.8% advance instead of 0.6%.Trade Tensions Likely to Remain High, Banks to GainAlso boosting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was the resurgence of trade-related tensions.  Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China commented on Tuesday the United States and China remain “very far apart” on settling trade-related disputes. Branstad’s views were in line with comments made by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on May 14.Tensions emanating from such a dispute can boost inflation levels and erode the value of fixed-income securities, thus pushing up yields higher. A sector which could immediately benefit from higher yield levels is banking.Shares of banks are bolstered by higher interest rates in the form of an uptick in bond yields. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. (Read: Resurgence of 10-Year Bond Yield: Winners & Losers)Our ChoicesThe rise in benchmark yield levels is primarily an outcome of encouraging retail sales numbers and the resurfacing of trade-related tensions. While unemployment is at a record low, a quick resolution to the trade dispute looking increasingly. This is why such inflationary pressures are unlikely to dissipate in the near-term.Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a profitable option at this time. This is because they are likely to benefit from the widening of the yield spread.

172,NTRS,"Shares of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) closed 1.7% higher yesterday, reflecting investors’ bullish stance on the bank’s impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets.During its Investors’ Day presentation held on May 10, Wells Fargo also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80% from 55-75% it had set in 2016.However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Let’s discuss the two keys takeaways of the presentation in details below.Impressive Cost-Savings PlanThe Sans Francisco-based bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Further, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry said that expenses for 2020 might be between $50 billion and $51 billion along with revenues consistent with 2017. However, he cautioned that it was not a formal projection and that the bank's will remain committed to improving revenues.Such measures will help the bank combat the persistent legal expenses. Also, this move might enable it to invest in productive areas.Lesser Impact on Earnings From Asset Cap, Time Period Might ExtendConsidering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank said that it expects the restriction’s impact on its net income after tax to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that slow growth in loans and deposits balance helped in reducing the impact to about $100 million.Also, after considering the restrictions, the bank was looking forward to continue building its balance sheet after a third-party review of its plans, to improve controls and governance, to be held in September 2018.However, on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the cap till the first part of 2019, in order to better enforce the plans to improve operations.Our ViewpointWells Fargo’s CEO, Tim Sloan, has launched a new advertising campaign with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices. On the other hand, it continues to settle past misconducts and accept penalties.It is uncertain when the bank will be able to get past the legal hassles and strict regulatory scrutiny. Further, unstable revenues remain another key concern for Wells Fargo. However, its expense control initiative might allow some room to deal with the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 3.1% over the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 18%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

175,NTRS,"For the Global Week Ahead, let’s look into Reuter’s in London’s five big themes. These are the ones likely dominate the thinking of investors and traders.I have left them in rank-order below.(1) Fresh U.S. Inflation Readings Come OutThe Federal Reserve has acknowledged U.S. inflation has perked up, adding to the conviction that interest rates will rise faster this year than previously anticipated. Price data due next week might cement investors’ view.While leaving the benchmark Fed funds rate unchanged at its last meeting, the central bank included somewhat more hawkish language in its statement, noting, “On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent.”Data out last Friday showed the U.S. economy added +164K jobs, fewer than forecast, while wages barely rose. However, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the so-called core PCE, rose +1.9% in the 12 months through March, the biggest increase since February 2017.Producer price (PPI) and consumer price indexes (CPI) are due next Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Investors fear that stock and bond markets won’t get much reprieve from the rate-hike concerns of recent weeks.The Fed is currently signaling two more rate rises this year. But the inflation figures, if strong enough, could confirm expectations that it will add a third.(2) The Bank of England (BoE) MeetsThe big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England’s May 10 meeting, with market expectations now overwhelmingly in favor of interest rates being held at the current 0.5 percent rate.Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early-April when investors priced a 90 percent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points.But a spate of weak economic data is almost certain to stay the BoE’s hand. Banks have slashed rate rise forecasts, with some not expecting one at all in 2018. That has taken sterling more than six percent lower in two weeks, tipping it into the red for 2018.Investors will monitor Governor Mark Carney’s language for signals on what the appetite is for hikes further out in 2018. More dovish remarks from the BoE could send sterling even lower.(3) The Argentine Peso Blow-Up ContinuesAlmost exactly five years after the taper-tantrum selloff in emerging markets, a resurgent dollar and rising global borrowing costs are smashing through Argentina and Turkey’s currencies like a wrecking ball.With the peso and the lira hitting record lows, Argentina has had to jack up interest rates to 40 percent in the third emergency hike in a week. Turkey too raised rates recently by 75 basis points after keeping it overly loose for years.While most emerging markets are suffering to some degree, Turkey and Argentina stand out for their rampant inflation and a dependence on foreign funding — both have large current account deficits and double-digit price growth, 25 percent in Argentina’s case.Higher interest rates should help. But with the U.S. dollar showing little sign of wilting and U.S. yields staying close to four-year highs, the pain could last a while longer.(4) Watch the Euro and European StocksThe U.S. dollar’s sudden surge has come as an unexpected spring gift for the Eurozone stock market after first-quarter results took a hit from the single currency’s strength.The euro’s recent fall to four-month lows helped euro stocks outperform Wall Street for the second month running in April. May is off to a good start and a three-month streak of outperformance, if it materializes, would be the longest since Jan-March 2015 when the euro hit 12-year lows to the dollar.Earnings growth for Eurozone firms in the STOXX 600 index is seen accelerating to 4.5 percent in the second quarter from the 1.4 percent expected for the first. In the last two 2018 quarters, they are seen rising 18.7 percent and 13.7 percent respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data.True, there are other variables too, in particular the speed at which the European Central Bank will phase out stimulus. But a hawkish turn there looks a distant prospect and in the meantime, euro equity investors should enjoy the ride.(5) Could We See Asia’s Small Currencies Get Spooked?For all the talk of Asia’s resilience to shocks, foreigners took fright at the first signs of a rise in U.S. yields and oil prices. Indonesia, India, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia have all seen outflows from bond and equity markets.That’s forcing central banks to intervene to limit currency depreciation, while simultaneously taking steps to keep domestic markets as liquid as possible. They are reluctant to raise rates. But that means delving into the hard currency reserves they have rebuilt since past bouts of volatility — and Indonesia has already spent $6 billion of these reserves over February and March to stem the rupiah’s slide.Both the Philippines and Indonesia release FX reserves data next week. We will also get a tally of foreign flows into their bond markets during April. Those data points should show how much further these economies can rely on intervention alone to defend their markets as the dollar keeps rising.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report): This $87B market cap Chinese stock has a an F long-term score from Zacks, but the #1 Rank means it has earnings estimate fuel in the tank.Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report): This is a U.S. Chicago-based $23B market cap bank.

177,NTRS,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.The company’s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Further, elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags.After considering impacts of notable items, net income was $1.68 billion, up 13.7% year over year. Revenues, Loans & Deposits Rise, Costs IncreaseU.S. Bancorp’s net revenues came in at around $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 3.4% year over year. The increase in net interest income and non-interest income contributed to higher revenues. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit and funding mix.Average earning assets climbed 3.1% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.13% was up 7 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by higher interest rates. Higher funding costs, loan mix and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.3 billion. The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and commercial products revenues.Provision for credit losses decreased 1.2% year over year to $341 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 2.3% year over year to $279.4 billion. The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card lending, total other retail and retail leasing. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate.Average total deposits were up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter to $334.6 billion. The rise was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 5% year over year to $3.1 billion, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses, partially offset by lower professional services and other expenses. Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $341 million, up nearly 1.8% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment. Also, total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, up 1.2%.However, non-performing assets came in at $1.2 billion, down 19.5% year over year. Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a decent capital position. Beginning Jan 1, 2018, the regulatory capital requirements fully reflected implementation of Basel III.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 10.4%, down 6 bps from the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.8% as of Mar 31, 2017.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 7.6% in prior-year quarter.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $26.54 as of Mar 31, 2018, from $25.05 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter. Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the first quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 68% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted a decent quarter. Elevated revenues on the back of increased lending activities and higher interest rates was a positive factor. Further, improving economy and lower taxes are likely to continue supporting its financials. Moreover, its efforts to enhance digital offerings and expand treasury management and payment services capabilities bode well for the long term.Nevertheless, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses remain a headwind. U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

179,NTRS,"Last Friday, as per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it had ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018. Per the filing “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018.Notably, Wells Fargo refrained from the allegations but said it had ""entered into the agreement in principle to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation.""“We are pleased to reach this agreement in principle and believe that moving to put this case behind us is in the best interest of our team members, customers, investors and other stakeholders,” noted CEO Tim Sloan. “We are making strong progress in our work to rebuild trust, and this represents another step forward,” he further added.The Story So FarThe above-mentioned case relates to the revelation of a sales scam, wherein the bank’s employees allegedly opened millions of unauthorized accounts illegally, to meet their aggressive internal sales goals.This financial bigwig has been under inquiry for setting impractical sales targets for its employees, compelling them to adopt fraudulent means for meeting the same. Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales tactics were first disclosed by The Los Angeles Times in 2013, when Los Angeles City’s Attorney Mike Feuer had begun investigation. This probe led to a lawsuit accusing the bank of high-pressure sales goals that encouraged unfair, illegal and fraudulent conduct, such as issuing unwanted credit cards to customers.The scandal was agitated in September 2016 following which the bank paid a combined penalty of $190 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the City and County of Los Angeles. In addition, the amount included $5 million in customer remediation.Per the above-discussed class action lawsuit, the investors’ claims included misappropriation of facts by Wells Fargo related to its cross-selling strategy which was not used for benefit of customers. However, the bank tried to ""designed to fulfill sales quotes or otherwise advance the interests of Wells Fargo or its employees and increase sources of profitability while simultaneously burdening customers with financial products they did not authorize, need and/or even know about,"" the suit claimed.Therefore, this led the shares to trade at ""artificially inflated prices,"" per the suit.Notably, investors filing the suit include buyers of Wells Fargo's shares between Feb 26, 2014, and Sep 15, 2016, following the bank’s $185-million settlement which resulted in a dip in its share prices. Union Investment — a European asset-management firm — was the lead plaintiff in the case, appointed by the court.Bottom LineCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.In February 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).Recently, the banking giant faced a penalty of $1 billion imposed by the CFPB and OCC due to its wrongdoings in the auto insurance and mortgage-lending business. As a result, the company’s first-quarter 2018 preliminary financial results got adjusted by an additional accrual of $800 million, which is not tax deductible. The accrual reduced the reported first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per share to $4.7 billion, or 96 cents per share.The bank’s performance over the past year underlines investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 4.8%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 12.3%. Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

180,NTRS,"On Apr 30, the Department of Commerce reported that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased year-over-year to 2% in March, hitting the central bank’s target for the first time in a year. This is the first proper material indication of inflation in the U.S. economy. Notably, PCE index is a key inflation measurement tool and the central bank’s preferred inflation barometer.As inflation reached the Fed’s target level of 2%, the market is expecting any of the two strategies from the central bank. The central bank may raise the magnitude of benchmark interest rate or it may increase the number of interest rate hike in 2018. It may also speed up the winding down of its bond purchases further.Whatever may be the fact, higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Moreover, President Trump has decided to do away with most of the regulations set down by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which imposed several stringent banking regulations. Considering these positives, investment in good banking stocks will be very lucrative.PCE Inflation Reaches Target BenchmarkThe PCE price index rose to an annual rate of 2% in March from 1.7% in February. The core PCE index — excluding food and energy — increased year-over-year to 1.9% in March from 1.6% in February. This is the biggest yearly gain in the core PCE inflation rate since April 2012.Price levels have been driven up by rising cost of oil, higher home prices, and a healthy labor market operating near its full employment level raising wages and salaries. A massive $1.5 trillion tax cut (including corporate and personal income tax) has bolstered both consumer and business confidence.March data released by the Department of Labor showed that consumer spending rose for the first time in three months, adding fuel to inflation.Meanwhile, Fed’s two day policy meeting is currently going on. Investors are expecting the central bank to raise interest rate latest by its next policy meeting if not this time.Trump Administration to Repeal Dodd-Frank RegulationsOn Mar 14, the U.S. Senate approved extensive changes to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law enacted by former President Obama in 2010. The U.S. House of Representatives is likely to vote in May on the bipartisan bill to repeal the stringent financial laws which were introduced during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.The bipartisan bill will enable banks with less than $250 billion in assets to skip yearly Federal Reserve stress tests for higher capital requirements. With this, dozens of regional banks will be exempt from submitting for Fed approval, a “living will”. Notably, Fed’s “living will” guideline provides rules about the liquidation of a bank upon failure without creating market turmoil.Additionally, the bill enhanced the scope of qualified mortgages. The banks which extend 500 or fewer mortgages a year will exempt from reporting various home loan data to the regulator.Our Top PicksStrong earnings, massive tax cuts and solid economic data are likely to boost consumer spending in the coming months forcing the price level to go up. This may prompt the Fed to aggressively implement tight monetary policy. Higher interest rate will eventually aid the banking industry.We narrowed down our choice on five banking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with solid growth potential.

181,NTRS,"As we have entered the Q1 reporting cycle, seasoned investors will be on the lookout for stocks with steadfast earnings growth. After all, if the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a stipulated time frame, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Shape Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.As the earnings season picks up pace, investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to invest in stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

182,NTRS,"Driven by top-line strength, Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.58 compared favorably with $1.09 recorded in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.42.Higher revenues and credit provisions were the positives. In addition, the quarter witnessed rise in assets under custody (AUC) and assets under management (AUM). Moreover, credit metrics marked a significant improvement. However, escalating operating expenses remained a major drag.Net income came in at $381.6 million compared with $276.1 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Margins & Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateTotal revenues of $1.48 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 billion. Also, the figure improved 15% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $392.7 million was up 8% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin (NIM).NIM  was 1.38%, up 3 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rate, partially offset by rise in premium amortization and a balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 17% from the year-ago quarter to $1.09 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees, other operating income and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 11% year over year to $995.3 million in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an increase in all components of expenses.Improvement in AUC & AUMAs of Mar 31, 2018, Northern Trust’s total AUC increased 14% year over year to $8.111 trillion while total AUM rose 16% to $1.16 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $147.8 million, down 22% year over year. Non-performing assets decreased 31% to $128.9 million as of Mar 31, 2018. Also, credit provision was $3 million in the quarter compared with $1 million reported in the prior-year quarter.However, net charge-offs were $3 million, up 50% from the year-ago quarter.Strong Capital PositionUnder the Advanced Approach, as of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 14.4%, 16.2% and 7.6% compared with 14.2%, 15.6% and 8.2%, respectively, in the prior-year quarter. All ratios exceeded the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares for $263.2 million at an average price of $104.51 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the continued growth in AUC, revenues and an improving credit quality, to some extent. Furthermore, a positive impact of rising rates was visible. Though escalating expenses might pose a threat to the company’s profitability, benefits of tax reform are anticipated to act as a tailwind.Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteNorthern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

183,NTRS,"BancorpSouth (BXS  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of 54 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents. Also, the bottom line compared favorably with the year-ago quarter earnings of 41 cents. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest revenues and non-interest revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Loans and deposit balances remained strong during the quarter. Further, the company recorded net recoveries in the quarter, which was a tailwind. However, worsening of capital position remained a key headwind.The company’s net income for the quarter amounted to $53.5 million compared with $38.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Rise in Revenues Partially Offset by Higher Expenses, Loans and Deposits IncreaseQuarterly net revenues increased nearly 17% year over year to $217 million. Also, the reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $210.7 million.Net interest revenues came in at $138.1 million, up 20.5% year over year. Fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) was 3.67%, increasing 21 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest revenues increased 11.4% year over year to $78.9 million. The rise was primarily due to growth in mortgage origination volumes and positive MSR valuation adjustment.Non-interest expenses were $147.7 million, increasing 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. The rise is due to impact of merger expenses and a single forgery and theft loss witnessed in the quarter.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were $13.9 billion, up 16.6% sequentially while loans and leases, net of unearned income increased 11.2% to $12.3 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing loans and leases were 0.66% of net loans and leases as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 0.76% as of Mar 31, 2017. Additionally, allowance for credit losses to net loans and leases was 0.97%, down from 1.16% registered in the comparable period last year. Also, the company recorded $1 million of provisions in the quarter, stable year over year.Further, non-performing assets were nearly $90.7 million, up from $90 million registered in the prior-year quarter. Annualized net recoveries, as a percent of average loans and leases, were 0.01% compared with 0.02% a year ago.Capital Ratios DeteriorateAs of Mar 31, 2018, Tier I capital and tier I leverage capital was 11.30% and 9.39%, down from 12.16% and 9.95%, respectively, at the end of the prior-year quarter.The ratio of its total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.99% at the end of the quarter, up from 11.45% as of Mar 31, 2017. However, the ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets contracted 80 bps to 8.69%.Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter, the company repurchased about 2.1 million common shares at a weighted average price of $32.32 per share. As of Mar 31, 2018, it had 3.9 million remaining shares available for repurchase under current share repurchase program through Dec 31, 2019.  Other DevelopmentsFollowing the earnings release, BancorpSouth announced plans to acquire Icon Capital Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Icon Bank of Texas, National Association. The acquisition would expand BancorpSouth’s presence in Houston. Also, the acquisition will add total assets worth $794 million, loans of $624 million and total deposits of $692 million to BancorpSouth’s balance sheet.Per the terms, the acquirer will issue about 4.1 million shares of its common stock along with $17.5 million in cash, for all outstanding shares of Icon Capital Corporation capital stock, subject to certain conditions and potential adjustments.Our ViewpointBancorpSouth reported a decent quarter. Improved NIM along with loan growth is likely to support its top line in the quarters ahead. Also, the company’s efforts to grow through acquisitions are encouraging.However, persistent decline in mortgage banking revenues continues to be a major concern. Also, deterioration in capital position remains another drag. Further, mounting expenses might hurt bottom-line growth.BancorpSouth Bank Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BancorpSouth Bank Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BancorpSouth Bank QuoteBancorpSouth carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of other BanksU.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.

184,NTRS,"The earnings season seems to have gotten off to a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far. These big banks’ top line was supported by increasing loan balances, expanding net interest margin due to higher interest rates and boost in trading revenues due to improved volatility.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for five of the 98 Finance Sector companies on the S&P 500 (accounting 23.7% of the total market cap) that have reported earnings so far, have increased 20.4% from year-ago quarter on 6.9% higher revenue growth.Further, for the first quarter as a whole, earnings of the finance sector are expected to be up 22.7% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues.Earnings releases will be coming in thick this week with Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report), scheduled to report on Apr 17, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these two Major Regional Banks when they report first-quarter 2018 earnings.ComericaComerica’s earnings are expected to be $1.49, reflecting 34.2% improvement from the last-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $811.6 million, 9.5% higher than the prior-year quarter. Rise in loans along with a favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s net interest income (NII). Fee income is expected to benefit from higher volume of M&A and improved equity markets, partially offset by poor mortgage activities during the quarter.Nevertheless, the tax reform is expected to benefit its results. Also, since credit quality trend remained benign during first quarter, the consensus estimate reflects a decline of 21.3% and 19.8% in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Also, our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Comerica as it has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Why an Earnings Beat is Likely for Comerica in Q1)The story about Comerica’s impressive earnings surprise history is better told by the chart below:Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated Quote Northern TrustThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for to-be-reported quarter earnings reflects a year-over-year improvement of 30.3%.Also, Northern Trust is expected to record a rise in revenues in the first quarter supported by higher interest and fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.45 billion shows 13% year-over-year growth.As Northern Trust incorporates a lag effect while calculating fees for custody and investment management, expansion of three-month LIBOR rate during the quarter is likely to drive related fees. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, custody fees are likely to increase 23.1% to $379 million. Further, with the improvement in foreign exchange (FX) backdrop, the company’s revenues from FX trading might increase.However, the company’s expenses are expected to trend upward due to its investments in new business activities and seasonally higher compensation expenses.Also, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of an earnings beat for Northern Trust are low.

185,NTRS,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for Apr 17, are expected to reflect a year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through the C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenues. A rise in revenues in this segment on the back of increased trading activities, will boost the company’s overall top line.Also, improved lending scenario, rising interest rates and bottom-line benefits from tax reform will provide further support to quarter’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion for sales for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets was relatively better in the first quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s first-quarter performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Backed by improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust is likely to record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Increase: Due to the rise in foreign exchange (FX) trading volatility and volumes, the company’s revenues from FX trading might increase.Custody Fees Might Rise: As Northern Trust uses lag effect in calculation of custody and investment management fees, expansion of three-month LIBOR rate along with higher trading activities are likely to drive related fees.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, custody fees are likely to increase 23.1% to $379 million.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Though Northern Trust has a cost-saving initiatives underway, continued investments in new business activities and seasonally higher compensation expenses may lead to a marginal rise in expenses.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Northern Trust will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is -0.70%.Zacks Rank: The combination of Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank of 3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.However, activities of the company during the quarter under review were able to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.42 was revised 2.2% upward over the last seven days. Further, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 30.3%.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

186,NTRS,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) long-term ratings are under review for downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation. In March 2017, the rating agency had rated U.S. Bancorp’s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1.Moody’s initiated the review on account of the $613 million settlement that U.S. Bancorp had agreed upon with several U.S. regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti-money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. (Read more: U.S. Bancorp to Pay Penalty of $613M for Money Laundering)Ratings for U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, have been placed for review. U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified. Also, the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed.U.S. Bancorp’s enterprise-wide risk governance, asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process. Notably, the company remains exposed to the risk of coming into light some other breach of law, which would lead to a violation of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement that the company had agreed upon with the regulators.What Can Drive the Ratings UpRatings of the company might witness an upgradation if Moody's is of the opinion that its enterprise risk governance and management stand superior to its peers and that it is likely to maintain above-average and consistent financial metrics.What Can Bring the Ratings DownOn the flip side, long-term ratings can be downgraded if Moody’s finds that the company’s enterprise-wide risk governance and management are not strong enough to place it above its peers. A sustained weakening in asset quality, capital or profitability metrics could also act as a negative factor.Shares of U.S. Bancorp have gained 4.7% over the past six months, underperforming the 19.7% growth for the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank & Key PicksThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

187,NTRS,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has received the judge’s approval for the settlement of $142 million worth class-action lawsuit related to the 3.5 million fake accounts scandal. However, customers still have scope for filing a claim if they feel they too have been wronged by the bank.The class-action lawsuit was an outcome of the bank’s undue pressure on its employees to achieve extensive sales targets, which led them to open unauthorized savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit from May 2002 to April 2017.The U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria feels that the settlement is an “imperfect solution”, but there was no alternative. He also said, “Class actions are to some degree rough justice, but I do believe this settlement is fair.”The settlement would entertain claims of those clients who have been charged fees on the accounts that were opened without their consent. Also, refunds would be made to customers whose credit scores have been impacted by Wells Fargo’s improper practice and led to higher borrowing costs for them. Lastly, the remaining amount will be distributed equally among the claimants.Wells Fargo has also been ordered to file some additional paper work that would contain an oversight mechanism to ensure the settlement is fully enforced before its attorneys receive their $21 million share.Since the breakout of scandal in September 2016, Wells Fargo made a lot of changes in its staff levels and practices, yet it continued to be involved in a number of legal issues. Recently, the bank settled a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for $480 million.The Sans Francisco-based bank has been paying a number of penalties on this probe since 2016. With this recently announced settlement, the bank would finally get a chance to move ahead of past misconducts.Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the high cost base. Also, the bank’s efforts to better its image among customers and the improving economic backdrop might support its growth in the near term.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 9.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) current-year earnings estimates have been revised 5.1% upward over the last 60 days.

189,NTRS,"Of the two major pre-election promises made by President Donald Trump, his supporters are on a roll to ease some provisions of an important financial regulation — the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This follows the achievement of a major milestone in late 2017 in the form of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 67 to 32, promising it to be beneficial for smaller banks. It would now be presented to the House for its requisite approval.Recapitulation of the Dodd-Frank ActAs a response to the 2008 financial crisis, caused partly by improper lending activities and investments by big banks, strict regulations were imposed on them through this law. Banks with assets of more than $50 billion were placed under stricter regulatory scrutiny, which included an annual stress test to prove that they could survive another financial meltdown.Further, a new regulatory board, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was established in order to safeguard consumers against predatory practices by companies offering mortgages, credit cards, student loans and payday loans.Such heightened regulations have kept compliance costs elevated for the banks so far. Also, higher capital requirements might have dampened investment to some extent. Moreover, some large institutions moved operations overseas to less regulated jurisdictions in order to avoid high regulatory costs.How Custody Banks Stand to Benefit From the Proposed Bill?The Dodd-Frank Act contained a provision that required banks to calculate supplementary leverage ratio, considering cash or customer deposits held with the Federal Reserve at the same level of risk as assets like subprime mortgages or junk bonds. It was aimed at keeping banks from taking big risks without proper plans to handle any downturn.However, this rule had a major adverse impact on the custody banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report). Custody banks safeguard assets and securities of large asset managers, hedge funds and other banks rather than conducting traditional banking activities. Despite sending these deposits to the Fed for safekeeping, these financial institutions had to factor them in while calculating the amount capital it requires to hold.The bill proposed by Senate makes an exception to this rule. It allows the custodian banks to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately sent to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, it would lead to a comparable reduction in the amount of capital they would require to hold.On the other hand, major banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) that perform custodial functions as part of their business have put forth objections. They want the exception to include all those banks that accept custodial deposits. However, this demand has some lawmakers worrying that these tweaks might be used by banks for their own purposes.Other Key Points in the Bank Deregulation BillThe most controversial change is uplifting of the SIFI threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion. This would result in a reduction in the number of banks considered “too big to fail” that are closely looked after by the Fed, to 12 from 38. Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion in total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.While some Democrats regard the bill to be compatible with the tax act, some consider it to be “extraordinarily dangerous”. Further, the bill along with the changes made so far have to be approved by the House and Senate once again, before being presented to the President.ConclusionWith this exemption, the custody banks will be able to utilize the excess capital toward expanding their businesses and diversify the product offerings. Also, shareholders of these banks might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.Of the above-mentioned companies, Citigroup and Northern Trust hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while JPMorgan, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

190,NTRS,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) exhibits mixed prospects for revenue growth, but cost-saving initiatives are expected to support bottom-line growth. However, litigation issues remain a concern.Expense management and streamlining operations internationally aided the company to surge 23% over the past year compared with 15% growth registered by the industry.Moreover, the company’s earnings estimates have been revised slightly upward, for the current year, over the last 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Citigroup has been emphasizing on growth in core businesses. Further, the company continues to optimize its branch network, with focus on core urban markets, improving digital channels and reducing branches. It is also making investment in several areas to stoke growth. Additionally, the ongoing investments in branded cards support the company’s growth strategy.The company’s operating expenses witnessed a negative CAGR of 9.2% over four years (2014-2017). Expenses dropped as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were more than offset by efficiency savings and wind-down of legacy assets. Though revenues remained volatile over the past few years, the company recorded 2% year-over-year improvement in 2017. We expect the bank to record significant growth in revenues in the near term, backed by continued economic recovery and focus on core operations with strategic actions. Notably, for 2018, management projects top-line growth at around 3%, with stronger growth in operating businesses being offset by the persistent wind down of legacy assets.Stocks to ConsiderComerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

197,NTRS,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) plans to refund about $330 million to its credit card customers by the latter half of this year, after having confessed to charging higher interest rates to some of the defaulters, since 2011.Per the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, credit card issuing companies are required to review the accounts of customers whose interest rates had risen after a missed payment or bounced checks. The companies are to determine whether the customer has resumed making timely payments or has displayed some other creditworthy behavior.On being satisfied of the customer’s financial standing, the rates are supposed to be lowered.In one such review, Citigroup discovered to have kept overcharging about 1.75 million accounts. The bank said to have found flaws in the methodology it used to calculate the reduced rates in some accounts.Majority of the affected accounts witnessed smaller rate cuts than they were eligible to, while the rest did not get the reduction at all. The New York based lender will be making average refunds of $190.    Also, the bank disclosed to have found no wrongdoings on part of its employees. Further, it apologized for having delayed in identifying the issue and promised to make amends at the earliest.Previously in 2015, the financial regulators had made Citigroup pay nearly $700 million to credit card customers who were made to buy unnecessary add-on services. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s findings, seven million accounts had been targets of “deceptive” marketing.The recent disclosure is likely to have a little impact on the Citigroup’s reputation. Moreover, the company, with its global footprint and attractive core business, seems to be well poised for growth.Shares of Citigroup have gained 28.4% over the past year, outperforming the 19.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

198,NTRS,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1% in the past month, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NTRS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Northern Trust’s Q4 Earnings Rise, Records Tax BenefitDriven by top-line strength, Northern Trust’s fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.51, compared favorably with $1.11 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Results include tax benefits and other one-time items. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.30.Higher revenues and credit provisions were positives. In addition, the quarter witnessed a rise in assets under custody as well as assets under management. Moreover, credit metrics marked a significant improvement. However, escalating operating expenses remained a major drag.Net income came in at $356.6 million compared with $266.5 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, net income was $1.2 billion or $4.92 per share compared with $1.03 billion or $4.32 per share in the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.69.Margins & Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateFor full-year 2017, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $5.42 billion, up 9% from $4.99 billion in 2016. Additionally, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.38 billion.Total revenues of $1.44 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion. Results also improved 16% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $396 million was up 20% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin (NIM) was 1.39%, up 19 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates and reduced premium amortization. The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 14% from the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, other operating income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 15% year over year to $1 billion in the quarter.

201,NTRS,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth. Also, it is critical in securing the support that was lacking from the earlier efforts to lessen undue regulatory burden.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

203,NTRS,"Major indices regained stability following an erratic week that ended Feb 9. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 4.3%, marking the largest gain since the election of Trump. On top of that, the S&P 500 registered a gain of 4.3% over the last five trading sessions through the week ending Feb 16, the highest since 2013.It seems investors are no longer fretting over the spike in inflation rates but are instead focused on record-low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job addition. In fact, analysts believe that the record job additions and strong GDP data will help the indices maintain the bullish momentum.Investors should know that out of the 10 sectors tracking the S&P 500 index, the Financial industry rallied 4.7% last week. In particular, banks are poised to generate more profits from higher lending rates. In other words, the possibility of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed through 2018 will likely boost bank profits.Fed May Raise Rate AggressivelyPer the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index ticked up 0.5% through January 2018, beating market expectations of 0.3%. The index rose 2.1% over the past 12 months, indicating that the central bank might make an aggressive move to raise policy rates.Leading investment management firm BlackRock added that the central bank could lift policy rates three or four times in 2018. The rate hike will increase the borrowing cost, leading to the payment of higher interest to lenders. This is expected to ensure higher lending income for banks.Loans to GrowThe mid-month report of the University of Michigan shows that the U.S. consumer sentiment index for the month of February has not only touched a record high but has also risen more than market expectations.The index scaled 99.9 in February, surpassing the estimate of 95.5 made by Reuters economists. It also reflects the second-highest mark over the past 14 years. This clearly shows that consumers are more interested in the news of low unemployment, wage growth, and solid GDP data than the market's tumultuous movement. Hence, significant job addition and healthy consumer sentiments will boost the demand for loans and other related products of banks.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP is expected to jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate by Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the U.S. Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year over year in January 2017.Tax Reforms to Benefit BanksThe tax bill, which was signed into law last year, will likely benefit banks. Although major banks took a hit in the fourth quarter owing to non-recurring non-cash chargea related to the tax reform bill, financial institutions expect the reform to prove beneficial in the long term.During the fourth quarter, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) reported net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share. The results included a non-recurring non-cash charge related to the tax reform of $22 billion. However, Citigroup expects lower effective tax rate to drive net income.Moreover, with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) expects its effective tax rate to be 17% in the first quarter of 2018, 19% in 2018, and nearly 20% in the near term.Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) believe that the tax reform will likely lower their effective tax rates to 19% for 2018. Media reports claimed that the rate for 2018 will be significantly below the actual rate paid during 2016 and hence will increase the combined profit of banks by at least $7 billion this year.Which Stocks to Focus On?Picking bank stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy. We have narrowed down our search to the following four stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and other favorable parameters.Headquartered in New York, JPMorgan is a financial holding company with assets worth $2.53 trillion and stockholders’ equity worth $255.7 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.

Also, the bottom line compared favorably with the year-ago quarter earnings of 40 cents. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by lower non-interest revenues.

205,NTRS,"Driven by top-line strength, Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.51 compared favorably with $1.11 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Results include tax benefits and other one-time items. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.30.Higher revenues and credit provisions were positives. In addition, the quarter witnessed a rise in assets under custody, as well as assets under management. Moreover, credit metrics marked a significant improvement. However, escalating operating expenses remained a major drag.Net income came in at $356.6 million compared with $266.5 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, net income was $1.2 billion or $4.92 per share compared with $1.03 billion or $4.32 per share in the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.69.Margins & Revenues Improve, Costs EscalateFor full-year 2017, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis, were $5.42 billion, up 9% from $4.99 billion in 2016. Additionally, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.38 billion.Total revenues of $1.44 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion. Results also improved 16% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $396 million was up 20% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin (NIM) was 1.39%, up 19 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates and reduced premium amortization. The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 14% from the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, other operating income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 15% year over year to $1 billion in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an elevation in mostly all components of expenses.Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Dec 31, 2017, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody increased 20% year over year to $8.08 trillion, while total assets under management rose 23% to $1.16 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $153.8 million, down 20% year over year.

206,NTRS,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Jan 24, are expected to reflect a year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through the C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenues. A rise in revenues in this segment will boost overall revenues for the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion for sales for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.3%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the fourth quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s Q4 performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust should record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Remain Stable: Given the mixed trend in foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility and volumes in the fourth quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading might remain flat for the quarter.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a marginal rise in expenses. Further, management expects transaction and integration costs relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management’s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland to be $8-$10 million in the fourth quarter.Adverse Impact of New Tax Code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the quarter.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model indicates that chances of Northern Trust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is +0.09%.Zacks Rank: The combination of Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.However, activities of the company during the quarter under review were unable to win analysts’ confidence.

Also, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 0.39%, over the trailing four quarters.Strong Leverage: Northern Trust’s debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.37 compared to the industry average of 0.88, indicating lower debt burden relative to the industry. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in an unstable economic environment.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Northern Trust’s ROE of 12.33%, as compared with the industry average of 10.29%, reflects the company’s commendable position over its peers. Notably, ROE is within the company’s target between 10% and 15%.Steady Capital Deployment: Northern Trust displayed its capital strength as it successfully cleared the 2017 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST). Pursuant to this, in July 2017, the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend to 42 cents per share, up 10.5%, effective in third-quarter 2017.

212,NTRS,"Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been adopting strategic initiatives, witnessing strong wealth management operations and enhancing shareholders’ value through regular dividend payments. Also, an improving rate environment has eased margin pressure and will continue to drive profits.However, rising operating expenses despite the cost-saving measures remains a concern. Further, change in global economic condition makes us apprehensive as Northern Trust runs a global business.Shares of Northern Trust have gained 14.9% over the past 12 months, underperforming 16.2% growth of the industry.However, the company’s current-year earnings estimates remained stable over the last 30 days. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A new business, which Northern Trust has set up in the last couple of years, continues to add institutional clients and assets, and also benefits from favorable equity market conditions. Moreover, the company’s innovative technology-driven hedge fund administration capabilities brought to the marketplace via Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services clearly provides an attractive proposition to clients.Further, organic growth remains a key strength at Northern Trust, as reflected by its revenue growth trajectory. Revenues grew at a five-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 6.2%, with the trend continuing in 2017 on rising net interest income. We believe that the company is well positioned to maintain this trend.On the flip side, despite the successful implementation of expense-reduction initiatives, costs escalated on investments in technology driving compensation and equipment and software expenses as well. Notably, non-interest expenses rose at a five-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 1.4%, with the increasing trend continuing in 2017. We believe that the rise in expenses will impede bottom-line growth.Moreover, as Northern Trust runs a global business, changing conditions of the global financial markets and general economic conditions might affect it. Weak economic conditions had affected wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities and savings patterns, which in turn impacted demand for trust and investment products and services.Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are CoBiz Financial (COBZ  -  Free Report), CNB Financial (CCNE  -  Free Report) and Republic Bancorp , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
