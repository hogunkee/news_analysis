0,INTU,"Guidewire Software (GWRE) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 70 to 75 Monday -- a welcome improvement, but still shy of the 80 or better score you prefer to see. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily identifies market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an RS Rating north of 80 as they launch their biggest climbs. See if Guidewire Software can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksGuidewire Software broke out earlier, but is now trading approximately 4% below the prior 92.75 entry from a cup without handle. If a stock you're tracking climbs above a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout. Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. The company showed -69% earnings growth last quarter, while sales growth came in at 14%. Guidewire Software holds the No. 12 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Financial industry group.

6,INTU,"Think technology is an important sector this year? Without techs, the S&P 500 would be down for the year.The S&P 500 owes its entire year to the technology sector's 8.5% increase and a 25% weighting, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a report Wednesday. No wonder then, four technology ETFs are in this month's ETF Leaders screen, including First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology (QTEC).The fund tracks the technology companies in the Nasdaq 100 index. That brings it most of the largest techs, including titans such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC).Because the index is equal-weighted, midcaps such as Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Intuit (INTU) have about the same weighting as Apple and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The fund has 37 holdings, with more than 40% in semiconductors, 35% in software, 10% internet and the rest in hardware, telecom and services.With performance spread out among the components, the fund can better withstand a plunge like Baidu's (BIDU) 15% slide the past couple of weeks. In a cap-weighted portfolio, Baidu's loss would hurt more. But the index's structure also means big gains from major components will be muted.That approach hasn't necessarily hurt First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology, and in some regards it has helped returns.As of April 30, the ETF had climbed more than 27% in the past 12 months. It rose about 22% in the past three years and 23% over five years. By comparison, SPDR Technology (XLK) was up 22%, 17% and 18% in the one-, three- and five-year periods. IShares U.S. Technology (IYW) was up about 23%, 17% and 19%. Both are also among IBD's ETF Leaders.First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology, which is up about 9% this year, is rebalanced four times a year — in March, June, September and December. The Nasdaq 100 tech index is reconstituted once a year.The ETF's chart closely resembles the other technology funds in ETF Leaders: They are all forming double-bottom bases with handles. For First Trust Nasdaq 100, the buy point is 80.06. Some investors saw an entry May 10, when shares climbed past the 78.90 buy point from the middle peak in the pattern. Shares remain near that level.With its components culled from the Nasdaq 100, the ETF is mainly a large-cap fund. The median component's market capitalization is at $33.76 billion. These tech stocks tend to command a premium valuation, resulting in an average price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7 as of April 30, according to the First Trust website.The ETF, with $2.54 billion in assets, does face some sector risks. For example, chipmakers have cited slack demand from smartphone manufacturers.RELATED:The Year's Best Sector And How To Invest In ItActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexHow Does The ETF Leaders Index Achieve Its Performance?

The Fed is widely expected to raise its target interest rate for a second time this year during its meeting on June 12-13.

8,INTU,"Software has been the sector to be in this year, making iShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) a winning choice for ETF investors.IBD's software sector is No. 1 out of 33 sectors, up an unmatched 19% since Jan. 1. It's not only the best sector performance but also well above the next best sectors: Medical and Consumer are up about 11% each.IShares North American Tech-Software has advanced about 17% for 2018. With $1.7 billion in assets, it owns nearly 60 of the largest software companies in the U.S. and Canada, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).Those three companies plus Salesforce.com (CRM) are the largest components of the fund, each with 7.6% to 9.3% of the portfolio.

The others have been good performers in 2018.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIntuit (INTU) has been one of the best performers. The publisher of TurboTax and Quickbooks consumer financial software climbed as much as 36% from a breakout in September. Splunk (SPLK) is another noteworthy holding. The data analysis software company is near a 112.76 buy point and has risen nearly 40% from a breakout past 84.98 at the start of the year.More than half the fund is invested in what it calls application software and one-third in system software. The rest is home entertainment software.Twenty-one of the holdings are in IBD's enterprise software and specialty enterprise software industry groups. Those two are up 25% and 21%, respectively, this year. Those groups are among the best this year, not just in the technology sector but the whole market.Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data are trends fueling growth areas for software companies. Many analysts remain bullish on technology stocks in general, and in particular the large caps.""At the start of the year, the bear case was higher (interest) rates. That hasn't hurt the group,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of market analysis firm DataTrek Research, said in a note Wednesday. ""Then it was fear of regulation. And the sector still worked. There's a reason for that Teflon coating: The fundamentals of large cap Tech are head and shoulders above anything else.""The ETF cleared the 179.35 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on May 7. Shares rose modestly and pulled back to the entry this week. They've held at that level and are in buy range.

11,INTU,"Facebook (FB), MSCI (MSCI), HubSpot (HUBS) and Pegasystems (PEGA) all attempted stock market breakouts Friday, but each has flaws that may give investors pause for thought. The social media monster rose 0.8% to 186.99 in Friday's stock market trading, nudging past a double-bottom base with a buy point of 186.20. Facebook is now back above where it was on March 16, just before the Cambridge Analytica scandal battered its share price.But there are reasons to be wary. Friday's move came on volume that was well below normal. You want to see breakouts occur in volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal, with the higher the better. Heavy volume on breakouts points to mutual funds and other big institutions loading up on shares. Low-volume breakouts can work, it's just that the odds are less favorable. It also doesn't help that Facebook's rally in the last few weeks has come in tepid trading activity.Facebook's stock price also is just nudging past the buy point. You'd like to see a breakout blast into a buy zone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlso, the double-bottom base is oddly shaped. Unaesthetic bases are more prone to failure.On the positive side the stock is now well clear of both its 50 and 200-day lines, while its relative strength line is at its highest level in three months. The RS line is still below its consolidation high, but at least it's above where it was when the stock was forming the middle of its W-shaped pattern.And as a leading stock, Facebook boasts top class fundamentals, with a 99 EPS Rating. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99.The company previously known as Morgan Stanley Capital International broke out from a far more aesthetically pleasing cup base without a handle with a correct entry of 160.08.But, like Facebook, MSCI's ""breakout"" was a low-volume affair, with the stock just crossing the entry, closing up 0.7% at 160.95. The RS line also is not quite at new highs.The provider of market indexes and equity portfolio analysis tools has been consistently beating views on both revenue and earnings, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97.The inbound marketing and sales software developer cleared a double-bottom base entry point of 117.70 intraday Friday following its strong adjusted earnings and revenue. But the stock, which hit 120.65 intraday, reversed in heavy volume to close down 2.55% at 114.65.HubSpot's Composite Rating is a strong 93.In the last 15 trading sessions, it has sold off on above average volume on six occasions, compared to just one day of above average buying.The business solutions software company made a move even though it missed earnings views Thursday. It came in six cents light at 16 cents per share, a year-over-year drop of 71%. However it beat on revenue, which increased 5% to $235 million.Pegasystems rose 2.9% to 65.05, clearing resistance around the 64 area. The stock closed in the midpoint of its range, which is only OK. Volume was heavy.While it boasts a decent IBD Composite Rating of 89, a clear red light is the EPS Rating of just 54.

18,INTU,"It is quite rare that a new technology transforms the world so significantly that people can't imagine life without it.The internet is one example. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google might be others.Yet, for those watching closely, it's certainly not a coincidence that early this year, four blockchain ETFs made their entrance into the market. And this trend is not necessarily linked to the hype surrounding digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Experts predict blockchain technology is not only here to stay, but could be a major disrupter in the way companies do business — possibly even larger than the internet.In descending order of asset size, the four ETFs are $178 million Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK), $124 million Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN), $38 million First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process (LEGR) and $13 million Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol (KOIN).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBlockchain is a digital ledger of information stored chronologically in ""blocks"" to allow for the efficient and nearly instantaneous processing and transfer of data. Experts say it could result in huge cost savings and increased profits for companies using it.""We really believe this could be one of the major innovations of the last 20 or 30 years, including the internet; it could be even possibly bigger than the internet was as far as disruption,"" said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares.A Reality Shares' report states that usage of blockchain is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 61%, and well-known companies including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intuit (INTU) are committed to adopting and developing blockchain technologies. In addition, it notes that there are over 1,200 blockchain startups, with private investment in those reaching nearly $5 billion in 2017, according to various sources.So, how exactly are the companies involved with the technology, and how can investors tell the real players from the fake ones?Ervin says that Reality Shares uses an economic impact score to see what impact blockchain will have on a company's future earnings. For example, even though IBM (IBM) is a huge company with many other projects going on such as artificial intelligence, ""blockchain's one of IBM's biggest initiatives in the entire company,"" he said. ""Their long-term strategic vision is really embracing blockchain and being the go-to provider of it.""Last year, IBM developed a food traceability blockchain platform for Walmart (WMT) to enhance food safety and transparency. It also partnered with Walmart and Chinese retailer JD.com (JD) in a Blockchain Food Safety Alliance collaboration to improve food safety in China. Ten other major food suppliers and retailers have expressed their interest as well.Another large player is Intel, which has developed a chip that allows for transactions to be committed to a shared database. ""If I'm a pharmacy and you get a prescription of Oxycodone, you can't forge it and create two copies of that anymore because it's all based on the blockchain,"" said Ervin. ""They (Intel) think their revenue alone could go up almost 20% just from this new chip that they've built, which will be at the core of all of these blockchain-as-a-service solutions.""Amazon's cloud service AWS is investing in blockchain in health care and life sciences, financial services, supply-chain management, security and compliance. A wide variety of applications have been developed by its AWS partners, including T-Mobile (TMUS), consulting firm PwC, vision specialist VSP Global, Samsung and Deloitte.Because blockchain needs a lot of processing power, chip producers such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are poised to benefit from the development and sale of specialized chips. First Trust's LEGR invests in providers of products and services to enable other firms to employ blockchain technology. Chips and other such providers comprise about 50% of the portfolio.The other 50% is comprised of firms that employ the technology to make their business more efficient, such as CME Group (CME), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Overstock.com (OSTK), said Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president at First Trust Portfolios.The fund will not invest in names that have not shown an actual test case, he adds: ""We don't want to have a company that says they're going to have a new cryptocurrency offering for a certain type of service, but they haven't made investments in it yet."" An example would be Eastman Kodak (KODK).Amplify's BLOK is the only actively managed fund among the four ETFs. Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, says that this allows the fund to quickly include new names or sell those that are involved in controversies.Besides the big conglomerates involved in blockchain, Magoon says the fund also holds some more pure-play names, such as Japanese IT firm Digital Garage, Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, and Japanese internet and media firm GMO Internet. GMO operates several cryptocurrency exchanges, offers a wallet service for cryptocurrencies, and a blockchain service to store medical records.""I think what's going to happen for investors is: You could wait (for more of a) pure play or some big announcement happens like 'Canada's government to use blockchain,' but for us, we're trying to be early in the game,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Blockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, AlibabaAI, Robotics, Blockchain Among Hot New ETF Industry TrendsFirst Trust Launches New Blockchain ETF To Meet Demand

21,INTU,"January's stock market performance reinforced fund manager expectations that economic growth abroad will be stronger than in the U.S.X ""Many investors believe that Europe and Latin America and places like Japan have the potential for even stronger earnings growth than the U.S. in coming quarters,"" said Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.3 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). ""That has led to some allocation shifts to non-U. S. stock names.""U.S.-focused Columbia Select Large Cap Growth is capitalizing on the trend in another way. ""Our fund contains many U.S. multinationals, which in aggregate obtain nearly half of their revenues from outside the U.S., so we benefit from the synchronized global recovery that way,"" Galvin said.And January's stock market showing was itself clear cut and upbeat — a fast start for the new year. The S&P 500 rocketed up 5.73%, pulling U.S. diversified stock mutual funds up 4.37% on average. That was the S&P 500's 15th straight monthly gain and its best monthly gain since March 2016's 6.78% jump. For U.S. diversifieds, it was the fifth monthly gain in a row and their best since November 2016's 5.19% climb.The broad market got a lift last month from such Dow Jones industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Travelers Companies (TRV) and Walmart (WMT).World equity mutual funds did even better than U.S. diversified stock funds, rising 5.66%.""The gains are evidence that economies in the U.S. and around the world are doing well,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 86% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Direct last month. ""When I talk with people producing tractors, combines, I hear about growth in areas where it hasn't been seen in years. In the U.S., unemployment is low, wages are rising and corporate earnings were very strong the last couple of weeks. And earnings projections are rising, getting a boost from lower tax rates.""The solid gains in January came amid month-end market softness. The market was rattled by rising bond yields, the prospect of new pricing pressure on health care providers and rising oil production, Galvin said. Rising bond yields fueled fears of a rotation from dividend paying stocks into fixed income.Countering with some upward pressure were strong corporate profit reports and job gains, as well as the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.By Thursday, though, there was enough downward pressure for IBD to read the market's direction as uptrend under pressure. Three out of four stocks follow the market's direction, according to IBD research, so stock mutual funds are likely to have more difficulty generating gains.With a 7.99% gain, large-cap growth funds paced all U.S. diversified stock fund categories in January. Global science/technology funds topped all sector categories by advancing 8.27%.Latin American funds led world equity fund groups with a 9.9% burst.U.S. taxable bonds eked out a 0.05% gain amid expectations of three Fed interest rate increases this year.Going forward, the technology, health care and consumer sectors look like the most fertile grounds for investment opportunities to Galvin, whose fund outperformed 72% of its peer group in the 12 months ended Jan. 31.The consumer sector is still showing strength after a strong holiday shopping season, he says. In health care, recently announced mergers have fueled anticipation of more consolidation, he says. ""Coupled with the benefits of offshore cash coming home due to tax reform, that's added to investor interest,"" he said.He notes a wave of tech companies are due to report earnings in February. ""I look at tech stocks as industrials on steroids,"" he said, ""with better corporate profits and benefits from lower corporate tax rates. We should see stronger capital spending, which will likely lead to greater spending in IT (information technology). Those factors should sustain strong gains by tech in 2018.""Amazon.com (AMZN), his largest holding, after the close Thursday reported Q4 earnings that smashed expectations amid strong sales growth.Looking beyond the near term, Galvin said, ""Despite its spending, Amazon has a long runway. It continues to grow its presence in a variety of sectors. This week's announcement about a health care partnership with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (to form a new health care company) is another reminder that Amazon has a presence not just in pure retail.""Galvin likes Alibaba Group (BABA) because it benefits from the fast growth of online commerce in China. ""It's the largest e-commerce retailer in China,"" he said. ""And China continues to show strong economic growth. And the accelerating preference for online spending there should power strong double-digit earnings growth in coming quarters.""Alibaba on Thursday reported that fiscal Q3 earnings rose 25% on a 66% sales increase, but earnings were below expectations.IBD'S TAKE: See how Alibaba's strengths — like four consecutive years of annual earnings per share growth and being ranked No. 1 in IBD's Retail-Internet industry group — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.And he likes the prospects for Priceline (PCLN). ""It's been a laggard, but it's a leader in online travel. Consumer spending will strengthen because of growth in wages, lower taxes and (younger generations looking for novel travel experiences). It should be a midteens earnings grower, although there are some questions about margin pressure in the near term.""Tech names that Fidelity's DuFour likes include tax- and accounting-software provider Intuit (INTU) and Microsoft (MSFT).Like Adobe, Intuit is shifting to a subscription model for cloud-based software from sold-in-stores software packages. ""They've got stronger growth because the (new model) lets them produce their programs for different countries by adding new language versions,"" DuFour said.Microsoft's Azure, a cloud computing competitor for Amazon Web Services, ""let's Microsoft cope with a changing world."" Growth in online gaming is one aspect of that, he added.And Walmart (WMT) is a newcomer to his top 10. ""Walmart has the size and capability to actually take on Amazon,"" he said. Walmart is learning how to compete online with Amazon from its acquisition of Jet.com, a low-cost online sellers of a wide range of goods.One example of how Walmart can leverage its existing assets is by having store employees deliver goods to customers on their way home from work, DuFour said.Charles Shriver, lead manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.4 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $344 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds, says his funds have shifted to overweight in foreign stocks. Many Japanese and eurozone stocks offer better valuations than many U.S. stocks, he says. Those markets have accommodative monetary policies at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates. And those stocks provide exposure to markets growing faster than in the U.S.Among Global Allocation's holdings, Japan's Sumitomo is a diversified conglomerate that trades goods and services. Shares were up 33% in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. ADRs for car and truck maker Toyota Motor (TM) were up 19% in those 12 months.ADRs of Bayer (BAYRY), a German-based maker of drugs, chemicals and agricultural treatments, are up 18% in the past 12 months. Earnings per share were flat in Q3 after two quarters of decline.ADRs of drugmaker Novartis (NVS), whose Swiss headquarters is not in the eurozone, were up 22% in the past 12 months. EPS grew 0%, 5% and 8% the past three quarters.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Gains, With A Foreign Tilt

Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages. But on Friday, all three indexes surged more than 1%, closing the week higher. Walmart (WMT) and Roku were big weekly losers. Treasury yields popped to fresh four-year highs on Fed minutes, but they backed off somewhat.The world's largest retailer reported better-than-expected Q4 sales and same-store sales, but earnings missed estimates. U.S. online sales grew 23%, less than half Q3's 50% annual rise, as Walmart (WMT) struggles to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart still sees 40% e-commerce growth this fiscal year. But its earnings guidance was light. Walmart online chief Marc Lore denied a report he might leave the retailer. Walmart said it will roll out a more-upscale home furnishings shopping portal.

44,INTU,"Unibail-Rodamco SE, Europe's largest commercial landlord, agreed to buy Australia's Westfield Corp. for about A$21 billion ($15.8 billion) in the biggest property acquisition since 2013 as declining store sales push mall operators worldwide to merge.X The Paris-based company offered a combination of cash and stock that values Westfield at A$10.01 per share, or about 18% more than Monday's closing price, according to a statement Tuesday. The offer has been unanimously recommended by the board of Westfield, the biggest private sector mall landlord in London and the 12th largest U.S. retail property owner.""Our first take is that we are not overexcited about the price — Unibail is buying at an implied initial yield of below 4%,"" said Peter Papadakos, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in London. ""If you think about where cap rates and yields are going in the U.S. and the U.K., which we think will be stable to upwards, the pricing is aggressive.""Unibail is mounting the biggest takeover of a company in the Asia-Pacific region this year — and the largest ever in Australia — as mall owners seek to contend with relentless pressure from online commerce. Shares of such companies have been hit hard and store closures are accelerating, pressuring landlords to fill empty space and reinvent shopping centers. Unibail-Rodamco's fell as much as 4.1%, the most since October 2016, after the deal was announced.Founded by billionaire Frank Lowy, Westfield began in 1959 with one shopping mall in the outer suburbs of Sydney and has grown to become one of the world's largest shopping center owners and managers. Westfield owns and operates 35 malls in the U.S. and U.K. valued at $32 billion, according to its website.""The U.S. is probably not the market where you'd try to sell"" lower quality malls ""at this point,"" Unibail-Rodamco Chief Financial Officer Jaap Tonckens said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""I think we'll focus on improving them, ride out the storm and see where we go from there."" The deal should be accretive to earnings from the first full year, he said.Westfield's properties include shopping malls in east and west London and the retail space in New York's World Trade Center. It gets almost 70% of its $1.8 billion annual revenue in the U.S., where companies are trying to re-purpose struggling brick-and-mortar shopping centers.""This is a combination of two of the best-in-class mall operators in the world,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sue Munden said. ""They will become a dominant player, have the best relationships with retailers and therefore be best placed to create the malls of the future.""The latest transaction is the largest in real estate since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sold an apartment owner to a consortium led by Equity Residential for more than $16 billion, a deal that was completed in 2013.The transaction implies an enterprise value of $24.7 billion, according to the statement. Unibail offered 0.01844 of its shares plus $2.67 in cash for each Westfield security, representing 65% stock to 35% cash, according to the statement.Unibail-Rodamco has been selling smaller and less-dominant assets in its European retail portfolio and reinvesting the proceeds in its development pipeline which includes larger malls which are expected to be more resilient to the growth of online shopping. The company has 8.1 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of planned projects, according to its website.The landlord will continue with a plan announced earlier to sell 3 billion euros of malls that are noncore, Tonckens said in the interview.Shares of Westfield have declined 9.4% this year, headed for their worst performance since 2011. The shares were suspended Tuesday ahead of the announcement.""Assets I've spent my life building, I could not imagine a better home for them than in this new company,"" Frank Lowy said via a webcast from London. Lowy will chair a newly created advisory board, and the family will maintain a substantial investment in the group, according to the statement.In other signs of consolidation in the industry, Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) is seeking to buy the portion of mall owner GGP (GGP) it doesn't already own. New York-based hedge fund Third Point is pushing for change at Macerich (MAC), including a possible sale, after building a stake in the real estate investment trust, people familiar with the matter said last month. Even after getting a boost from Brookfield's interest, GGP shares are down 6.4% since the beginning of the year.The deal will lead to speculation that Simon Property Group Inc., the biggest U.S. mall owner, will also look to expand, Munden said. The firm, which has seen its shares fall 8.7% this year, owns about one-fifth of Klepierre SA, the Paris-based shopping center owner that's been renovating its properties.The U.K.'s biggest publicly traded mall owners are also combining forces. Hammerson Plc this month agreed to buy its smaller competitor, Intu Properties Plc, in a deal that values the latter at about 3.4 billion pounds ($4.6 billion).""We're going into London, we believe it's a global city and will be fine"" despite the slowing U.K. economy, Tonckens said. ""Will it be choppy? Probably.""

50,INTU,"D.C. news moved markets during the week. The Dow and S&P 500 index hit record highs as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and other financials rallied on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields. Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains. The Dow rose 2.9%, its best weekly gain of 2017. The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and other financials also rallied on rising bond yields while many retailers rebounded on holiday sales hopes. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% as tech leaders struggled, including China internets, many chipmakers and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB.)Bitcoin's roller coaster ride continued this week, clearing $10,000, then $11,000, then face-planting closer to $9,000 before moving back to around $10,700. The jolts came as smaller investors get more active in trading the much-hyped cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, big financial names continued to weigh in on the prospects of digital currencies: Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles called digital currencies a ""niche product"" that could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if adopted more widely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that something that ""moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency."" But derivatives regulator CFTC OK'd Bitcoin futures at the CME (CME) and CBOE (CBOE), with CME saying it'll launch futures on Dec. 18. Cantor Fitzgerald and reportedly Nasdaq (NDAQ) also are moving toward offering futures in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose 55% for the week.Cyber Monday was the biggest yet: Adobe Analytics said shoppers spent $6.59 billion online, up 16.8% from the prior year, with nearly a third of that spent via mobile devices. Amazon (AMZN) also announced that this was its single biggest shopping day in history, overtaking the most recent Prime Day; the Echo Dot proved most popular. Adobe believes this will be the first holiday season to surpass the $100 billion mark in online sales. But shares of many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied on expectations of a strong or at least better-than-feared year-end performance. Macy's (M) said it will hire extra holiday workers due to strong demand.General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019. The top carmaker in the U.S. sees self-driving vehicles as a cornerstone of future mobility — and a potential profit driver. It faces a slew of new entrants in a rapidly transforming auto sector, not least Alphabet (GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit. Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale. GM shares look set for a 4% weekly drop but are up 22% on the year.Marquee auto and tech companies also looked to the future at Automobility LA, a curtain-raiser for the LA Auto Show.

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales fell, largely in line, as the automaker slashes fleet sales.The Federal Reserve is on track for a December rate hike, Jerome Powell, the current Fed governor who will replace Janet Yellen as chair in February, signaled in a Senate hearing on his nomination. Powell also said that he sees the current 4.1% unemployment rate as about the lowest it can go without putting upward pressure on inflation. His remarks suggest that the Fed's hawkish-but-patient tilt probably won't change much after Yellen's exit.

53,INTU,"Stocks hit record highs during the holiday-shortened week. Black Friday kicked off holiday shopping, while several retailers reported earnings, including Lowe's (LOW) and Dollar Tree (DLTR), along with tech giants Salesforce.com (CRM), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE).

Earnings were mixed, with Salesforce, HP, HPE falling on results or guidance.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe Justice Department said the megamerger would harm consumers because the combined media-and-telecom giant might extract higher prices for Time Warner (TWX) content from other video distributors, or try to withhold content from emerging rivals. The DOJ has asked AT&T (T) to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T rejected the DOJ's claims and proposed conditions, suggesting President Trump's animus toward Time Warner-owned CNN was a key factor. The DOJ's move could chill other big mergers, analysts say. AT&T and Time Warner rose about 1%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 7% Wednesday on weak guidance and CEO Meg Whitman's decision to step down on Feb. 1 amid ongoing restructuring. Antonio Neri, who was named president in June, will replace Whitman. October quarter earnings and revenue topped lowered expectations. But for the January quarter, HPE forecast adjusted EPS of 22 cents at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 28 cents.

HP shares fell 5% Wednesday.Marvell Technology (MRVL) announced a deal to buy fellow chipmaker Cavium (CAVM) for more than $6 billion to create an ""infrastructure solutions powerhouse"" in communications and data centers. Marvell agreed to pay $40 and 2.1757 Marvell common shares for each Cavium share, or $91.78 as of Friday's close. Both stocks rose sharply after gaining earlier in the month on reports that a deal was close.Salesforce.com (CRM) reported Q3 earnings surged 62% to 39 cents a share, with revenue rising 25% to $2.68 billion, both topping. But for the January quarter, Salesforce.com forecast adjusted earnings of 32-33 cents a share vs. estimates of 34 cents a share. Salesforce.com named Bret Taylor, a former chief technology officer at Facebook (FB), as president and chief product officer. Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip, where Taylor was CEO, last year. Salesforce.com named Alex Dayon chief strategy officer. Salesforce shares fell 1.8% Wednesday but just edged lower for the week, right at record highs.The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission moved closer to dismantling the Obama administration's net neutrality rules. The FCC aims to increase broadband investment by cable TV companies and other internet service providers. The FCC will vote Dec. 14 on Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to scrap public-utility-type Title 2 regulations that were foisted on ISPs. ISPs may be able to charge content providers or business partners fees for ""prioritized"" services. Some regulatory authority on consumer protection could shift to the Federal Trade Commission. Pai says new ""transparency"" rules will protect consumers.RELATED:Why FCC Net-Neutrality Reversal Could Later Be Reversed AgainPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 earnings rose 34% while revenue swelled 27% to $505.5 million, both topping the consensus.

Palo Alto's solid quarter followed soft sales and disappointing guidance from other computer software security providers.On Monday, Roche (RHHBY) unveiled upbeat data from trials in immuno-oncology and hemophilia A — sending its shares up 8.6%. But Dow stock Merck (MRK) fell to an 18-month low after Roche's combination of Tecentriq, cancer drug Avastin and chemotherapy helped reduce the risk of disease worsening or death in patients with advanced lung cancer. Merck's Keytruda-and-chemo combo was approved in May. Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) lost nearly 10% as Roche said its Hemlibra significantly reduced bleeds in a Phase 3 study of hemophilia A.Malls were crowded on the traditional holiday kickoff even as online and mobile shopping continues to grow rapidly and retailers of all kinds touted deals well before Black Friday. Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are expected to do well, but it will be a critical holiday season for Macy's (M) and other department stores.Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 EPS jumped 25% to $1.01 with sales up 6.4% to $5.32 billion, both beating Street estimates.

The rapid expansion of consumer loans, especially on online microloan platforms, has raised concerns among financial regulators.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales beat estimates, helped by higher home-repair demand in the wake of the summer's string of hurricanes. But shares fell, with some analysts saying Wall Street may have wanted more acceleration following a weak second quarter, and expressing concerns about thinner margins and its outlook for the year. Earlier this month, larger rival Home Depot (HD) beat views and raised its full-year forecast.The QuickBooks and TurboTax maker's earnings leapt 83% as revenue grew 14% to $886 million in the October fiscal first quarter, easily beating views.

58,INTU,"It's hard to think of LogMeIn (LOGM) as an underdog anymore.This scrappy tech firm took on the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Citrix (CTXS) and pioneered remote access to desktop and handheld devices via cloud computing. Now it's turning its guns on targets like Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Zendesk (ZEN).XEarly this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.""The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group. ServiceNow (NOW), Paycom Software (PAYC), Blackbaud (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as Dell Technologies (DVMT) and HP Inc. (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like Verizon (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and IBM (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.""Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,"" Wagner said. ""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

63,INTU,"In a good year for technology stocks, IBD's software sector has climbed nearly 30%. IShares North America Tech-Software (IGV) ETF has been a vehicle for that trade.The exchange traded fund is up about 38% in 2017 and trading near all-time highs. Its performance has earned the fund a spot on IBD's ETF Leaders screen, and it's the only pure-software ETF on this month's list.As happens with other leading ETFs, the success of many of its top components have carried the fund to a market-beating performance. In the case of iShares North America Tech-Software, solid advances for Microsoft (MSFT), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Intuit (INTU), Red Hat (RHT) and several others have combined into an attractive basket of software stocks.Microsoft — the largest holding, with a nearly 9% weighting — is near an all-time high as it stretches a fine advance of 33% that began a year ago. That's when the stock broke out of a base on a bullish earnings report.Activision climbed as much as 46% from a breakout on earnings Feb. 10. Red Hat is up about 50% from a February breakout. ServiceNow (NOW) has risen roughly 30% from breakouts in January and April.IShares North America Tech-Software includes companies in video game, medical, database, security, financial and other software segments. According to the iShares website, the ETF is about half invested in what it calls application software, about one-third in systems software and 14% in home entertainment.After its powerful run, is the ETF at risk of exhausting itself?The software industry is largely cyclical. Continued expansion of the U.S. economy, improving corporate profits and capital spending, plus low unemployment make for a good foundation for growth.But the software sector certainly follows pullbacks and corrections in the general market, and growth stocks tend to fall more than the main indexes during weak markets.A positive trend is that few of the 57 stocks in iShares North America Tech-Software are in risky late-stage bases, overstretched in their price runs or under stress.That also means there are quite a few stocks that have traded horizontally for many months and haven't participated in the software rally. But those are concentrated among the ETF's smaller holdings (Open Text (OTEX), Splunk (SPLK) and CA Inc. (CA), to name a few).Indeed, the top-weighted holdings are where most of the best stock gains are found.The ETF itself climbed past a 145.80 buy point in late August and remains in buy range. Shares pulled back to the 50-day moving average a few weeks back and found support at that level, a sign the ETF can continue to advance.RELATED:Technology ETF Rolling, But Will Q3 Earnings Halt The Party?Amazon, Microsoft Join To Offer Artificial Intelligence Platform

72,INTU,"Ah, those sociable humans, they're always up to something online — texting, tweeting, messaging, Googling.HubSpot (HUBS) Chief Executive Brian Halligan says he's staying on top of all that, and making it work to his company's advantage.X""We are really watching the way the marketplace and humans are changing, and building products to match that,"" Halligan said on a recent company earnings call.HubSpot is an 11-year-old maker of sales and marketing software based in Cambridge, Mass., and it sells to small- and midsize businesses. Its own pitch is that potential customers — aka those sociable humans — find businesses through digital channels like blogs, internet search engines and social media. HubSpot's expertise lies in attracting people to websites and optimizing content so that visitors are converted into paying customers.Its mantra: Help customers create more personalized interactions with their prospective buyers to close the deal. The strategy has helped HubSpot see its revenue shoot up 38% to $171 million in the first six months of 2017. Shares are up 52% this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2018 revenue growth to slow to 25% from 34% this year. HubSpot could beat those earnings estimates if new initiatives gain traction, says Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen & Co.""Their rate of growth has come down. Marketing tech in general is a tough market to scale. It's fragmented with lots of small vendors. So to come out as a single winner and take a lot of market share has been challenging,"" said Wood, who has a neutral rating on the stock.Further, HubSpot's main challenge is maintaining a sales growth rate that will support its valuation.HubSpot has evolved into a multi-product company — adding sales automation and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Many of HubSpot's customers have 10 to 50 employees, with some in the low hundreds. Analysts say HubSpot targets firms with up to 2,000 employees.The company has focused on the midmarket as opposed to competing head-on for large corporate accounts vs. the likes of Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM), SAP and Adobe Systems (ADBE). That way HubSpot has avoided the cost of investing in its own sales staff to chase down and close deals, says Wood.""What's different about these guys is the focus on midmarket. They have to keep the new-customer growth engine going. They're looking at new ways to acquire customers,"" said Wood. ""Also going into new markets, like they're doing with sales force automation and CRM, is going to drive growth. But I don't think you'll see them go upmarket into (larger) enterprise (firms).""HubSpot's customers mostly engage in business-to-business marketing. They buy online subscriptions to software that ranges from $2,500 to $30,000 annually. The average marketing customer spends about $13,000 a year.HubSpot also has laid claim to what it calls ""Inbound Marketing."" Halligan and co-founder Dharmesh Shah wrote a book on using Google, social media and search-friendly blogs to attract customers via the internet. HubSpot sells tools that track the online activity of website visitors and personalize content as their interests are identified.Halligan says people are spending less time texting, emailing back-and-forth, or searching on Google. Instead, Halligan says, they're using messaging platforms more, including Slack, in the workplace.And, humans consume tons of video. So HubSpot helps its customers evaluate video platforms such as Facebook (FB) Live for marketing purposes.""If you look how people spend their day, they're spending an awful lot of time on social media,"" Halligan said on the earnings call. ""There are big shifts going on, and HubSpot's going to be there to help our customers through it.""HubSpot has used Twitter (TWTR), Facebook and Instagram to build its own follower base. In late September, HubSpot will host its annual ""Inbound"" user conference to rally the troops.Still, there's more to HubSpot's marketing than social media engagement. HubSpot has built up sales channels, such as website design and marketing agencies, that point people toward its products. About 40% of revenue comes from customer-referral channels, says Wood.HubSpot aims to borrow some techniques from Intuit (INTU) and Autodesk (ADSK), which have successfully targeted accountants and architects, as partners. HubSpot aims to partner with sales agencies. HubSpot also works with industry players. HubSpot has growing ties to Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn and its sales tools.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 76.20. The stock is hovering near its 50-day moving average. Alarm.com, Realpage, and Appfolio have the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of companies in IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group.The company also provides help in integrating its software with Salesforce.com's bigger platform. And, HubSpot's tools work with e-commerce payment platforms such as Shopify (SHOP).HubSpot recently rolled out a $50 monthly marketing starter package. New visitors to its website are greeted with offers for free versions of HubSpot products. After using free versions for a while, or ""freemiums,"" the company figures users will upgrade to paid products.""If you roll the clock forward two, three, four years, that's just the way I think humans are going to buy products because they're going to want to try it and use it (first),"" said Halligan on the earnings call. ""This freemium thing is going to be here to stay.""Indeed, HubSpot has added two new board members — one from software firm Atlassian (TEAM) and one from data storage provider Drop — both of which use freemium business models.HubSpot has more than 34,300 customers, up 40% from a year ago, with roughly 27,000 of them buying marketing tools. Average revenue per customer has been falling, however, due to the lower-priced offers.Nate Cunningham, a Guggenheim Securities analyst, says HubSpot has a ""greenfield"" opportunity to target small companies that never bought marketing software. He says HubSpot needs to improve operating margins as it adds customers in new ways.""The No. 1 determinant of HubSpot's growth is probably not competitive displacement, to gain share vs. Salesforce or IBM,"" said Cunningham. ""It's more about how can they get people to try their product who never have had a marketing product before. I think greenfield is where the bulk of the opportunity is.""HubSpot had over 5,000 ""Growth Stack"" customers as of June 30, up from 3,000 at the start of the year. These high-spending customers buy more sales, CRM and marketing software tools. And, they're more likely to renew subscriptions annually as opposed to leaving.Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair, says HubSpot is on the right track.""We believe HubSpot's customer growth is a good indication of the health of the business,"" he said in a note to clients, ""and provides significant up-sell and cross-sell opportunities longer term, which we believe could ultimately lead to an acceleration of the business as soon as next year.""Shares of HubSpot have been in decline while forming a deep handle, but were up 2.2% at Friday's close to 67.35.RELATED:This Education Company Reaps Newfound Disposable Income In ChinaAd Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

73,INTU,"Years ago, few looked to their financial advisor for ways to harness technology to gain financial savvy. But the spread of smartphones has turned many advisors into early adopters.XWith an increasing number of people using mobile apps, advisors often position themselves as tech-smart guides. Depending on a client's need, they may recommend everything from budgeting software to interactive programs that teach children how to spend and save.The tricky part is gauging a client's receptivity to technology. During the onboarding process, advisors can assess a newcomer's interest in establishing online accounts, downloading new apps and tracking their portfolio while on the go.While many individuals want to take advantage of the latest tech platforms and products to simplify their financial lives, others resist. Worries about security and cyberhacking — or a desire to conduct business face-to-face — can signal a client's preference for old-fashioned communication.""My clients range in age,"" said Samuel Boyd, a certified financial planner in Washington, D.C. ""Across all age spectrums, I'm finding that people are mostly receptive to technology. For younger clients who grew up with it, it's not time-intensive to learn and use it. For others, it can require some trial-and-error at first.""One of the most popular personal finance tools that advisors share with clients is Mint. Acquired by Intuit (INTU) in 2009, Mint provides budgeting, bill-paying and other money management features.Boyd, who has used Mint with his clients for about six years, finds that the Web-based service complements his role as an advisor. Planners can integrate Mint into client reviews and encourage cash flow tracking on an ongoing basis.""It helps you understand where your cash is going,"" he said. ""A lot of clients will say, 'I didn't know I spent so much on restaurants.' It opens their eyes to where their money is being spent.""To add value, some advisors help clients engage their children in money matters. They may use technology to improve the entire family's financial literacy.With many teens wedded to their smartphones, Boyd makes his clients aware of mobile apps such as Acorns. He urges parents to share these online resources with their kids.""I use Acorns with clients who want to educate their children about investing,"" Boyd said. It provides an easy way to invest spare change, gain familiarity with diversified portfolios and see the benefits of compound interest.Boyd arranged for a client's two teenage daughters to sign up for Acorns. Now they are steadily contributing small amounts of money in exchange traded funds.""Investing can be scary to young adults,"" Boyd said. ""If you can introduce them to investments early, the fear isn't there. And if you meet them where they are as digital natives, chances are you'll get them to pay attention.""Advisors scout out mobile apps that appeal to preteens as well.Kari Jean Glosser, a certified financial planner in Santa Monica, Calif., recently discovered Motion Math (www.motionmathgames.com) that offers online games for youngsters.""I played its Pizza app for 10 minutes and loved it,"" she said. ""Kids are already on their phones. Why not teach them something valuable about money management and the economics of how a business works.""Many digital budgeting and saving tools offer free or low cost services. Some charge a monthly fee or a percentage of assets based on account size.Many advisors look to digital technology to simplify clients' lives. Their favorite mobile apps streamline processes and create default options that promote speedy, sensible financial decisions.Glosser uses DocuSign so that clients can complete documents with electronic signatures. This helps her practice go paperless and boost efficiency when executing legal and financial transactions.""Clients love the ease of it,"" she said. ""It presets those fields they need to fill out and advances them to the next field. And they can complete their paperwork — like opening an account or setting up different distributions — while on vacation.""Boyd favors Digit (www.digit.co) to enable clients to engage in disciplined saving with minimal effort. Linked to a checking account, the app tracks the user's balance and automatically sweeps small amounts of cash into a Digit savings vehicle.""One of my core principles is you need to set up a life hack so that you can save without having to think about it,"" Boyd said. ""That's how Digit works.""Boyd's firm, Capital Asset Management Group, hosts ""Tech Tuesdays"" to educate clients and the general public about mobile apps and other platforms they can use to manage their finances. Attendees bring their laptops and sample different money management tools.RELATED:Meet The Man Best Buy Hired To Take On AmazonQuotes Of The Week: From Barbara Corcoran, David Olgilvy And More7 Positive Paths To Pushing Past Mental Barriers

76,INTU,"Stocks rode through Wednesday's closing bell with moderate gains, buoyed by the release of minutes showing the Fed bullish on a possible rate hike in June.The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each added 0.4%. The S&P 500 rose more than 0.2% and made a new closing high. Preliminary data showed volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq than at the end of trade Tuesday.Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May 2-3 meeting showed the Fed remained supportive of an increase in the key interest rate at its June meeting, which would mark the second rate hike this year and the third since December. The minutes also showed the committee considering to begin winding down the Fed's $4.5 trillion stockpile of bond holdings amassed in its monetary stimulus, but probably not until later in the year — a reprieve for those who had begun expecting some action as early as September.Investors liked what they heard, sending the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq sharply higher just after the release.

That followed Trump's remarks to airline CEOs last week when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.Wednesday's meeting included CEOs from Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO), Target, Tractor Supply (TSCO) and JCPenney (JCP), who were in Washington, D.C., to lobby the White House and Congress against the border tax.""We're cutting regulations big league,"" Trump said at the meeting, later adding, ""You have a very, very big regulatory problem, and we're going to take care of that, because I want more jobs.""He also pressed the executives on growth.""We want you to expand your stores,"" Trump said. ""You'll tell me why you will or why you won't. And tell me why you won't, we'll work on you a little bit.""The issue of a border tax did not come up specifically during the public remarks. But Target said later it was brought up, though didn't mention what Trump said about it.""They also discussed the … proposal for a border adjustability tax, which is a priority issue for Target because it will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials,"" Target said in a statement, according to CNBC.If enacted, Target said, such a policy ""would have profound implications for our guests and business, and at Target, we believe that anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America.""Trump did reiterate his administration's attempts to bring down the overall tax burden on businesses and simplify the tax code, so much so, that ""H&R Block probably won't be too happy — that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.""Shares of H&R Block (HRB) fell as much as 2% on the comment but pared losses and were down 0.8% to close at 20.80 on the stock market today.

The barrier to entry for some of Intuit's services is not particularly high.Yet, the barrier-to-entry argument sometimes ignores the flip side. In some businesses, there is a barrier to exiting. Change can be a hassle. For example, switching banks, brokerages, or even plumbers can be either time consuming or risky.

93,INTU,"A 41% increase in QuickBooks Online subscribers powered a fiscal Q1 earnings beat for Intuit (INTU) late Thursday, sending its shares rising early Friday.The company, also known for its TurboTax tax-preparation software, also gave current-quarter guidance above the consensus estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Intuit stock 1.9% to 115.98 in the stock market today. That puts shares about 1% below a 117.07 buy point out of a flat base. Shares hit their all-time high of 116.97 on July 13.For its Q1 ended Oct. 31, earnings per share minus items fell 33% from the year-earlier quarter, to 6 cents, as revenue rose 9.1% to $778 million, both metrics beating analyst expectations.For Q2 ending Jan. 31, the company guided to EPS ex items of 33-36 cents on sales of $1.045 billion to $1.065 billion, up 13-15%, where analysts had modeled 34 cents and $997.8 million.The company maintained its fiscal year guidance, which includes revenue rising 7-9% to about $5 billion at the midpoint of its range.IBD'S TAKE: Intuit is in IBD's Computer Software-Financial industry group, which ranks a lowly No. 157 of 197 groups tracked. Typically, the stock winners come from the winning groups. Which groups are hot? IBD's Industry Snapshot should be on your checklist.Intuit, which in March completed the sale of its Quicken personal finance software to private-equity firm H.I.G. Capital in order to focus on tax and accounting software, said it now has 1.6 million subscribers to its QuickBooks Online, its accounting software geared to small and midsize businesses.

RBC maintained its sector perform rating on Intuit stock, with a price target of 108.Its first two fiscal quarters are typically the slowest for Intuit, ahead of its busy tax season, and once again it posted a net loss in Q1, losing 12 cents vs. 11 cents in fiscal Q1 2016.RELATED:Intuit Falls After Fiscal Q4 Earnings — As Usual

95,INTU,"As has been the norm, Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in the third quarter as the information technology sector overall led the field, says a report by FactSet Research.Firms in the S&P 500 overall spent $115.6 billion on share buybacks in Q3, but that was down 28% year over year and the smallest quarterly total since Q1 2013.Top spender Apple repurchased $7.2 billion worth of shares in Q3. Following Apple for second place was General Electric (GE) at $4.3 billion, then Microsoft (MSFT) at $3.55 billion, Allergan (AGN) at $3.2 billion and McDonald's (MCD) at $2.77 billion.Apple, General Electric and Microsoft led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in Q2 as well. Three months ago Microsoft said its directors had authorized a new stock buyback program of as much as $40 billion, and the company reaffirmed that it is on track to complete its current $40 billion buyback authorization by year-end.IBD'S TAKE: Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding. It's also a move that companies make when they begin to transition from rapid growth into middle age.As has been the norm for the S&P 500 index, the information technology sector was the top spending group in terms of buybacks at $27 billion, but that was down 41% year over year. Several major contributors were the smaller repurchases from Oracle (ORCL), Intuit (INTU), and Apple. The financials sector was the second top spending group, with $25 billion worth of stock being repurchased in Q3.Apple shares rose 0.1% to 117.06 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple, Exxon Mobil Lead S&P 500 In Q2 Dividends PaidApple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Are Kings Of Cash

Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. AWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware (VMW), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers.Rather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard, which now includes Freeport-McMo-Ran, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. ""The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,"" wrote Pritchard. ""We believe the market may be overly concerned around impact on Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK) and VMware.""He noted that Salesforce.com, Splunk, VMware as well as Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Intuit (INTU) are slated to take part is RE:Invent sessions.""We expect to hear AWS partnering more to keep up with Microsoft and IBM (IBM) in hybrid cloud deployment,"" Pritchard said.""We expect investor sentiment coming out of re:Invent to continue to focus on its disruptive impact on the enterprise market with significant traction with big-name customers,"" he said. ""We note that AWS as a development platform lags its position in infrastructure, but we see many of these customers presenting on how AWS is becoming key to its custom app development effort, replacing the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle (ORCL).""AWS announced a new round of cloud computing price cuts in November.Citigroup lowered its price target on Amazon.com to 960 from 965 on Monday, on possible margin impact from the price cuts.In Q3, Amazon said AWS revneue jumped 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, topping analysts' estimate of $3.19 billion.Amazon stock fell 1.7% in the stock market today to 766.77.

97,INTU,"Intuit (INTU) stock fell Wednesday after the TurboTax maker late Tuesday gave current-quarter guidance that lagged analysts' expectations. But then, the financial software maker's stock has also fallen the past two Augusts after earnings, in all three cases pulling back at a time when shares were trading near record highs.Many investors, even experienced ones, make the mistake of buying a stock just ahead of the company's earnings report because it's trading near highs and seems to be acting right. That can work out, but earnings can also spark big declines, even in good stocks.IBD'S TAKE: IBD provides an options strategy, found within the weekly Earnings Preview feature, to help investors limit risk around earnings and to capitalize on upside potential, while also reducing the risk of a negative reaction to the report. Investors can instead try weekly or monthly options, if the price is right.Intuit stock fell 3.5% to 109.85 on the stock market today. Shares hit a record high just below 117 last month.The fall from grace follows a pattern. Intuit stock plunged 13% last August, on the day after its earnings report, and it fell 2.6% in August 2014 after earnings, after dropping by as much as 4.3% during that session. (Shares also fell a small fraction after the August 2013 report.)Intuit's fiscal Q4 ended July 31, after tax season, though the company said total TurboTax unit sales rose 12%, outpacing its overall sales growth of 8%, to $754 million. That beat views, as did its earnings per share minus items of 8 cents, swinging from a 5 cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.The company's small-business segment, mostly its QuickBooks products, saw sales rise 10%.But Intuit's fiscal Q1 guidance of $740 million-$760 million in revenue, up 5% at the midpoint, missed Wall Street expectations, and did its EPS ex items guidance of 1 cent-3 cents, vs. 9 cents in the year-earlier period.The company's fiscal-year guidance, however, met Wall Street expectations, Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim said in a research note.Brean was one of at least two investment banks that hiked their price targets on Intuit stock following the earnings report. Brean raised its target to 135 from 130, while Goldman Sachs upped its target to 124 from 123.""We highlight that the company continues to show year-over-year improvement in its SBG (small-business group) operating margin for the past four quarters, and we expect that trend to continue,"" Kim wrote.But RBC Capital Markets cut its price target to 108 from 113 and lowered its financial estimates for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.In a research note, RBC analyst Ross MacMillan said smaller stock buybacks accounted for some of the lowered estimates, as well as ""a slightly more cautious view on SMB Desktop ecosystem and no material upward revisions to our SMB Online ecosystem estimates.""

The generic drugmaker's fiscal Q4 earnings and revenue cleared analysts' targets by a wide margin, and management hoisted its 2017 revenue guidance to well above views. Results were buoyed by Lannett's $1.23 billion acquisition of UCB unit Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, closed in November.Telecom construction outfit Dycom (DY) dropped 3%. It reported late Tuesday fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings that easily cleared analysts' projections. Dycom's revenue guidance for Q1 was in line with consensus views, although the midpoint of EPS guidance was a shade short. Management also lowered expectations for revenue in 2017 from the recently acquired Goodman Networks, but said the unit would produce higher-than previously expected operating earnings for the year.Trendy fashion retailer Express (EXPR) swooned 23% at the open. Second-quarter earnings and revenue declined more than forecast, and comparable sales, online sales and gross margins continued to weaken.La-Z-Boy (LZB) reclined 15.5% after a narrow earnings miss, and a wide shortfall on revenue in its fiscal first-quarter report.The Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.2% in June. That was in line with the prior two months' growth, but just shy of expectations for a 0.3% rise, and the second quarter data show what the FHFA release notes as a ""potentially significant market shift."" A 0.2% gain in each of the three months of the quarter, ""is a much more modest pace of appreciation than we've seen in some time and most likely reflects accumulated pressures from significantly reduced home affordability,"" the statement said.

Microsoft is the second-largest stock among 73 holdings in the portfolio of diversified technology companies.Top holding Apple (AAPL) reports Tuesday, but most investors are expecting fireworks. Apple stock has been hammered in the past year amid mounting worries about growth for its flagship iPhone products.Apple's woes have weighed on XLK, which lags several technology ETF peers year to date despite recovering along with the broad stock market since the Brexit low of June 27.This flagship tech exchange traded fund has risen 6.6% so far in 2016 through July 19. By comparison, Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology (RYT) is up 7.6% over the same period.Both ETFs track the technology sector of the S&P 500 index, but weight stocks in the portfolio differently.RYT gives each stock an equal stake in portfolio assets, thereby limiting the impact that dominant players in the sector -- such as Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL)-- have on returns. Apple accounts for less than 2% of portfolio assets in RYT vs. roughly 13% in the cap-weighted XLK.""Apple's and Alphabet's relatively weak performance in 2016 has dragged down XLK,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. He noted that both these stocks have far smaller weightings in RYT, benefiting its performance.RYT also benefited from more exposure to smaller, lesser-known names such as Paychex (PAYX) and Intuit (INTU) that performed better, he pointed out.Apple is the only top 10 stock in XLK with a double-digit negative return in the past year, down 21%. Microsoft is up 17% and Facebook (FB) 27% over the same period.XLK holds $12.31 billion in total assets.IBD'S TAKE: Apple shares are rising but its Relative Price Strength Rating is a lowly 19.

Revenue grew 11%, 9%, 21%, 22% and 25% in the same quarters.How many big-cap stocks can claim that kind of earnings and revenue growth? Not many.

120,INTU,"Office subleasing, an early indicator of past downturns, is at its highest level since 2010. The amount of available space from subleases in the city jumped to 1.9 million square feet (176,500 square meters) last month, a 46% increase from the end of the third quarter, according to a report from Cushman & Wakefield. Twitter (TWTR), Intuit (INTU), and Zenefits are among tech companies putting excess space on the market.“It’s the beginning of the change,” said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “We’re very early in the correction process. It’s going to take several years to play out, and we don’t know how deep it will be.”A five-year frenzy for San Francisco office space may be cooling as venture-capital investments decline and tech firms slow their hiring from a breakneck pace. The extra space is a warning sign that the growth rate for some companies was unsustainable, Rosen said. Some startups took more space than they needed in the hopes of expanding later, while others are moving to less-expensive areas or shifting staff to other buildings in the city.A pullback would be a marked shift for one of the hottest U.S. real estate markets. San Francisco had the lowest metropolitan office-vacancy rate at the end of last year, at 5.9%, according to CBRE Group (CBG). The San Francisco Bay area was No. 2 in the country for office investment in 2015, behind New York, the brokerage’s data show.“A lot of the startups aren’t doing as well as the money behind them would like them to do, so they’re cutting off the flow of funds for a number of these companies,” said Robert Sammons, regional director of research at Cushman & Wakefield in San Francisco. “These companies are having to make corrections in their business plans.”The largest share of space on the market is from companies that are contracting or consolidating, according to Cushman & Wakefield. As of the end of last year, about 55% was from the technology industry.An increase in subleasing preceded office-market downturns following the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at CBRE in San Francisco.The trend isn’t entirely negative. Some companies that leased space in the early stages of the boom can rent it out at a profit. Others may be expanding and moving into bigger offices, an indicator of growth.Subleasing also opens up more affordable space at a time when rents are near record highs. The space on the market for sublease has asking rents about 17% below those of regular leases, according to Cushman & Wakefield.“If you’re looking to move to San Francisco, the increase in subleasing availability is a sign that there’s still space available,” said Drew Murrell, citywide revenue manager in the division of budget and analysis at the San Francisco Controller’s Office.Twitter is subleasing 50,000 square feet at its 1355 Market St. headquarters, according to Matt Hart, executive managing director at Savills Studley, a tenant brokerage.A spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment. The social-media company, which said in October that it would cut as much as 8% of its staff, has lost 67% of its market value in the past year.Companies such as Intuit are banking space that they’re renting with plans for expansion but don’t yet need. The software firm is subleasing two floors at 22 Fourth St. “that we have in our portfolio for future growth,” said spokeswoman Diane Carlini.Zenefits, which occupies four floors at 303 Second St., is subleasing space to move workers to adjacent floors, said Jessica Hoffman, a spokeswoman. The human-resources software startup, facing investigations over compliance with state rules, said last month that it would cut about 250 jobs.A big chunk of the subleasing space on the market comes from Charles Schwab (SCHW), which is subletting about 300,000 square feet as it combines its two San Francisco offices into one while boosting staff in other states, including Colorado and Texas, said Sarah Bulgatz, a spokeswoman for the financial-services firm.More than 1 million square feet in additional sublease space will likely be available this year, said Hart of Savills Studley. He said that he’s more concerned about a shift in tenant demand.“Many startups that were hiring 10 to 20 employees per month have adjusted to a net zero to three employees per month,” Hart said.Jobs in San Francisco’s tech industry, which includes Internet, software-publishing and data-hosting companies, increased by an annual rate of 5.1% in January, half the 10.5% growth in the same period the year before, according to Amar Mann, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Anemic initial public offerings and falling valuations for some tech companies are leading to a decline in the early-stage investments that help fuel office demand. Venture-capital investments fell 32% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months to $11.3 billion, according to a January report from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Bay Area companies releasing IPOs dropped to 26 in 2015 from 35 the year before, Savills Studley data show.“We’re going to have a correction in the job market in San Francisco over the next several years,” said Berkeley’s Rosen. “We had an economy that was growing based on the availability of capital rather than the fundamental performance of some of the companies.""Related:More Commercial Investors Home In On Multifamily Sector, Study SaysChic Co-Working Spaces Now Drawing A Corporate CrowdCrowdfunding Tests NYC’s Commercial Property Market.

121,INTU,"Growth stocks have had trouble in a market that has favored defensive stocks lately. But several top growth names in the IBD Stock Spotlight are nearing buy points.

122,INTU,"Twitter (TWTR) said people using Apple's (AAPL) iOS or Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android can now add descriptions to images in tweets, a benefit to the visually impaired.The update allowing descriptions -- also known as alternative text -- empowers ""everyone to ensure content shared on Twitter is accessible to the widest possible audience,"" said Twitter engineer Todd Kloots in a blog post Tuesday. .""Photos have been at the center of some of the biggest moments on Twitter,” said Kloots. ""As a core part of the Twitter experience, it's important that images shared on our platform are accessible to everyone, including those who are visually impaired.”People can use the feature via the ""compose image descriptions"" option in the Twitter app's accessibility setting. When an image is added to a tweet, the user can tap the ""add description"" button and insert a description of up to 420 characters to the image. Visually impaired people will have access to the description by using assistive technology, such as screen readers and braille displays, Twitter said.Smartphones have other accessibility features, including VoiceOver, the iPhone's built-in gesture-based app that reads text on a touchscreen aloud, and Google Android's TalkBack, through which visually impaired users can access anything on their phones.Voice-activated services, including Apple's Siri, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet's Google Now, Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and others, can assist all consumers, including the visually disabled, as people increasingly rely on mobile phones for shopping, communicating and information.But surveys have found those voice-activated services aren't getting much use. Just 13% of U.S. mobile phone owners use a voice-controlled personal assistant on their device each day, according to a survey last June from 451 Research.The Americans with Disabilities Act requires websites and mobile applications to be accessible. Google announced its Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities last year with a $20 million grant for technology innovators in the nonprofit community who work on technology to make people with disabilities more independent.In addition to Twitter and Microsoft, Adobe Systems (ADBE), Dropbox, LinkedIn (LNKD), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (FB), Intuit (INTU) and others have jointly asked universities to train computer students in accessibility software design and are requiring new hires to demonstrate some familiarity with it, according to the Mercury News.Besides facing competition from rivals such as Facebook, Twitter is struggling to expand its user base as its user growth has slowed. Twitter has launched programs to reel in ""logged out"" users who visit Twitter's site but don't have accounts of their own, making them less coveted by advertisers.Twitter stock was up 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 16.Image provided by Shutterstock.

123,INTU,"Tech stocks got hurt amid the market volatility of the past few months as investors flocked to defensive sectors such as food and utilities.But now, with the market back in a confirmed uptrend since Feb. 17, some beaten-down techs have shifted to recovery mode. And while their charts may not look pretty, their declines weren't too severe. All were within proper pullback range of less than around 33% from the base's intraday high to intraday low.Adobe Systems (ADBE) corrected as much as 26% from its Dec. 17 high to its Feb. 8 low. The stock reset its base count, as the bottom of its current pattern undercut that of the previous base. It's since regained its 40-week moving average but is finding resistance at its 10-week line. The design software maker is 10% off its high and needs more work on its base's right side.Adobe's base features four down weeks in above-average volume. Yet two of them have shown support as shares closed near the top of their weekly range. That indicates institutional investors stepping in to buy the stock. Counting those two weeks, Adobe saw four accumulation weeks vs. two distribution weeks along the left side of the base, a positive sign.Intuit (INTU) is working on a first-stage pattern after also resetting its base count. The stock has come back from a 13% drop on Aug. 21 that followed disappointing fiscal Q4 earnings and announcing that it would sell home-accounting software Quicken and two other units. The correction in the base was 27%. Shares have regained the 10-week moving average, which is rising.The TurboTax maker on Friday reported fiscal Q2 results that topped views. Intuit's 98 Composite Rating puts it among the top-rated stocks in IBD's financial software group.MaxLinear (MXL) is still in buy range from a 16.29 double-bottom buy point. The correction within the base was less than 29%, in normal range. The stock found support at its 40-week line along the bottom of the base. A B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.4 up-down volume ratio imply healthy demand for shares.

124,INTU,"No. 1 tax-preparation software maker Intuit (INTU) -- as it heads into its busy season -- posted Q2 earnings and Q3 revenue guidance that beat Wall Street expectations, only to see its shares fall. One analyst says that the shares might be falling because the company didn't raise its guidance for the year.At least two analysts raised their price targets on Intuit stock after the earnings release, and another was bullish on the tax season. Yet, Intuit stock fell 4.3% on the stock market today, to 95.75.In an interview after the earnings release late Thursday, Intuit CFO Neil Williams said that the company's ""momentum is really continuing into Q3.""Intuit said that sales for its fiscal Q2, which ended Jan. 31, rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter to $923 million. The company swung to a 25-cent per-share profit minus items from a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $893 million and 19 cents.The company doesn't give earnings guidance, but it expects Q3 sales of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion -- at the midpoint up only 4.4% from the year-earlier quarter but above the $2.2 billion analyst consensus. Wall Street expects EPS ex items to rise 10%, to $3.15 per share.For the fiscal year, Intuit sees revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, up 8.5% at the midpoint.But the company didn't raise its guidance for the year, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan told IBD, and there are questions about the company's underlying growth potential.Another factor could be the strong earnings and guidance this week from software makers  Salesforce.com (CRM) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Intuit, MacMillan says, is regarded as a ""defensive"" stock play, but if other stocks are doing well, Intuit is less attractive.In a research note, MacMillan said that Intuit's TurboTax sales stood out last quarter, rising 9%. He hiked his price target on Intuit stock -- but only to 93 from 91.UBS analyst Brent Thill called the results the ""best start to tax season in 13 years.""The fiscal Q3 tax season is always the company's biggest quarter.“We’re in the third year of a multiyear journey and are beginning to see a sea change in how Americans prepare their taxes, driven by the massive innovation across the TurboTax experience combined with a breakthrough marketing campaign that makes our product the hero,” Sasan Goodarzi, executive vice president and general manager of Intuit’s Consumer Tax Group, said in the earnings release.Part of Intuit's plan to drive consumer tax growth is to leverage its do-it-yourself tax packages, CFO Williams told IBD. ""Think about growing the DIY market as growing our total addressable market,"" he said.Thill also says that Intuit is a good defensive play. Williams agrees, saying that the small businesses that comprise much of Intuit's customer base often turn to its software packages when the economy heads south. Besides TurboTax, Intuit is known for its Quicken and QuickBooks small-business software.""Our products are needed most when small-business owners are maybe facing some headwinds economically."" Williams said. ""We do well with economic uncertainty.""Wedbush analyst Gil Luria raised his price target on Intuit stock to 100 from 90.Intuit rival H&R Block (HRB), which makes the other major tax-preparation software product, is slated to report fiscal Q3 earnings on Thursday.

126,INTU,"It's not easy for a company to improve performance and culture with a single, solitary action. Hiring the right executive, however, can be that game changer.So says David Perry, who with Mark Haluska wrote “Hiring Greatness: How to Recruit Your Dream Team and Crush the Competition.”Perry, a longtime recruiter of senior executives as managing partner of the professional search firm Perry-Martel International, adds that a bad hire could mortally wound an organization. “These days, no organization survives long without strong leadership,” he told IBD.Tips on hiring from the top down:Live ROI. The acquisition of key players is an investment like any other, “one which should have a demonstrative return on investment which clearly justifies the effort and cost involved,” Perry said.Put a team together. Someone needs to lead the employment search. Perry has found that most boards of directors and CEOs “lack the knowledge, experience and time needed” to find talent.A company’s board should appoint a search committee and establish:1. What you need in a candidate with a highly specific job description.2. A search timeline and costs.3. A strategy for the search.4. A process for hiring the best candidate.Define internal responsibilities. You and the interview team should know your roles and key areas to focus on when interviewing, says Nick Mailey, vice president of talent acquisition at Intuit (INTU), which develops financial and tax preparation software for small businesses and accountants.“At Intuit, we ensure greater success by holding an Assess 4 Awesome (A4A) meeting with the interview team to align on role and responsibilities,” he said. “These hiring plan meetings drive stronger outcomes, higher quality hires, faster recruiting times and better experience for candidates.“Your company is only as good as the talent you attract. Every leader’s top priority is to ensure you hire and retain top talent.”Inspire candidates. As an interviewer, you’re the face of the company; your behavior is a reflection of that, Mailey note.It’s not just that you want to hire candidates; they have to want you as you’re competing for talent with others.“Lead with inquiry, and let your ego take a back seat,” he said. “People remember how you make them feel. At Intuit, we train employees on how to effectively assess candidates, while maintaining a positive experience.“Managing your employment brand and aligning it with your company’s brand and/or values is the trick.”Make it easy. Ninety-five percent of employed executives will pass on the opportunity to even talk with you if they need to create a resume first, Perry shares.The alternative is to tailor a confidential candidate brief for them. It gathers the information you need to see if they’re a fit while educating and selling the opportunity.Set high standards. Many executive searches fail because those searching didn’t do enough research, Perry and Haluska have found.“Too often, searchers cut corners,” Perry said. “They mistake a Google search and LinkedIn (LNKD) scan for research and pick the low-hanging fruit. Real research starts with a much broader perspective. So analyze your industry, identify which companies are winning, and find out who is driving their success. That’s who you want.""Wrap them up.  At Intuit, top talent assessors make a decision on whether to advance with a candidate, and managers are leveraged to close the deal with whom they want, says Mailey. He adds that a number of companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon (AMZN) have a similar approach.Perry said that when it comes to recruiting top talent, “companies like Tesla Motors (TSLA) or Google want to change the world. Can you offer your candidate a challenge this engaging?”Image provided by Shutterstock.

161,INTU,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly is planning to remove the headphone jack from its smartphones starting with next year's iPhone 7, and at least one analyst says that's a terrible idea.""I am pretty certain that Apple is considering whether or not to remove the headphone jack, but actually taking this drastic step is far more dangerous than one would think,"" Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor said in a research note Wednesday.Removing the audio jack ""runs the risk of annoying a great number of Apple users,"" he said.Citing a reliable source, Japanese blog Macotakara said Apple plans to remove the 3.5-millimeter headphone port from the upcoming iPhone 7 to reduce the handset's thickness by ""more than 1 mm"" compared with the iPhone 6S.If Apple takes this step, the only way to connect headphones to the device would be either via Bluetooth wireless or through Apple's proprietary Lightning port.""The real danger in removing the headphone jack is that it could have a negative impact on the upgrade cycle where users are inclined to keep their older Apple devices for longer because of a feature that they love and investments they have made in accessories,"" Windsor said.Windsor says Apple will come to its senses and keep the 3.5-mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7.""Making the iPhone thinner is not a priority for Apple as: First, the iPhone is already thin enough and making it thinner is unlikely to generate the kind of returns that would justify the investment to make it so,"" he said. ""Second, a thinner device would also have less structural rigidity, meaning that it would be even more susceptible to being bent than its predecessors.""Ditching the audio jack also would negatively impact mobile payments firm Square (SQ) and rival service GoPayment from Intuit (INTU). The dongles that Square and Intuit use for processing credit cards plug into the headphone jacks on smartphones and tablets.If Apple follows its traditional release pattern, the iPhone 7 will come out next September. But some observers speculate that Apple could release the new handset earlier.AppleInsider last month said it learned from a reliable source that Apple was planning an earlier release for the iPhone 7, perhaps in the summer.Speculation about the features of the iPhone 7 already has begun. Many rumors have focused on Apple eliminating the home button below the screen. Other insiders have said Apple plans to make the iPhone 7 waterproof.RELATED:Apple iPhone 6S attracts more Android switchers.

162,INTU,"Intuit (INTU) late Thursday posted Q1 earnings and sales that beat Wall Street's expectations and sent shares rising after hours. The company, the maker of No. 1 tax software TurboTax and the small-business software suite QuickBooks Online, reported revenue of $713 million, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter, and earnings per share minus items of 9 cents, swinging from an 11-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $670 million and a 4-cent per-share loss.Intuit stock was up 8% in after-hours trading after it released results for its fiscal Q1, which ended Oct. 31. Intuit stock rose a fraction in Thursday's regular session to 97.42, which is down 11% from its all-time high above 109, touched on May 22.""We exceeded our subscriber and financial targets in the first quarter and have raised our earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year based on these initial strong results and our acceleration of share repurchases in the quarter,"" Intuit CEO Brad Smith said in the company's earnings release.The company said that its small-business operations ""drove momentum"" and that QuickBook Online subscriptions, a key metric, rose 57% to 1.159 million subscribers.Intuit executives raised Q2 EPS ex-items guidance to 17-20 cents. The company expects revenue of $880 million-$900 million, where Wall Street had modeled $823 million.Intuit is amid a transition. In August, the company announced that it would sell its popular personal finance software Quicken as well as its QuickBase and Demandforce business lines. In its earnings release, the company said that it's ""on track"" to divest the businesses by ""early 2016.""Intuit will focus on ""doing the nation's taxes, and small business,"" spokeswoman Diane Carlini told IBD. TurboTax's main rivals are tax preparation products from tax service company H&R Block (HRB).Fiscal Q3, ending on or near April 30, is Intuit's largest quarter because of the U.S. tax season, during which the company garners about half its annual revenue. For Q3 fiscal 2016, Wall Street expects revenue to rise 5% year over year to $2.3 billion.

198,INTU,"While mobile-phone adoption rates keep rising, legacy telephone systems still largely tie down the office work world. That's good news for RingCentral (RNG). As a provider of less costly, cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) alternatives, it sees plenty of room to grow its business.Besides desktop phones, the company's technology lets workers use their mobile phones, tablets and laptops to communicate, whether through voice, text, or audio and videoconferencing — wherever they might be.""We are disrupting a massive market,"" said Vlad Shmunis, founder and chief executive of Belmont, Calif.-based RingCentral, referring to the $50 billion-$75 billion global business communications market, some $20 billion-$25 billion of it in the U.S.""Historically it's been dominated by legacy hardware solutions that no longer address the needs of modern workforces,"" he said in an interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""Cisco (CSCO) and privately held Avaya have owned the market for a couple of decades. We don't see them in our space.""Small SpaceRight now, RingCentral's ""space"" is still small. Cloud-based communication systems account for roughly 5% of the business communications market. On-premise phone systems, many managed by in-house tech staff, comprise the rest.RingCentral calls itself the largest player in that small space. Rivals include 8X8 (EGHT), which is expected to log $205 million in revenue in its fiscal year ending in March, up 26% from the prior year.RingCentral's revenue is expected to climb 33% this year to $294 million and 24% in 2016 to $365 million, say analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. In Q3, revenue grew 35% to $76.8 million. Most was from software subscriptions.It recently received seals of approval from two big tech companies. Its app was one of eight business programs endorsed by Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google for reliability and performance. And Microsoft (MSFT) has integrated the company's flagship RingCentral Office into Microsoft Office 365, its core productivity workflow product.Wave Of FutureAnalysts say cloud-based communication is seen as the wave of the future as workers use more devices and more tools, from phones and email to instant messaging and audio and video conferencing.""The communications infrastructure has become more complex as we use more and more tools,"" said Elka Popova, program director for unified communications at Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consulting firm. She notes that complexity spurs businesses to find simpler and cost-effective solutions in cloud-based communication systems.""Businesses are arguably moving to this new (cloud-based) communications model,"" Popova said.The cloud communication market is growing 25% to 30% annually in North America among both installed users and revenue, she says. That, she adds, is ""rapid adoption.""RingCentral offers its cloud and SaaS solutions to customers based in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, where the business launched two years ago. Almost all of its revenue is still generated in the U.S. and Canada.""RingCentral is the market leader in North America,"" Popova said. Yet the market is highly fragmented, with no one company having yet reached 10% market share.Still, competition could intensify. Companies with significant hardware communication offerings, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Mitel Networks (MITL), ShoreTel (SHOR) and Siemens Enterprise Networks, could become ""more aggressive"" in defending their legacy market share with competitive solutions, J.P. Morgan analyst Sterling Auty said in a report to clients.The Telecom ThreatTelecom companies might also get more aggressive in rolling out cloud solutions. Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) have deployed ""some solutions,"" Popova says, adding that RingCentral has been more ""nimble and innovative.""""For a long time, telecos were relatively reluctant to focus on more advanced, next-generation services because they were afraid to cannibalize their existing solutions,"" she said. ""Unlike large telecos, RingCentral didn't have much to lose by pursuing cloud communications. Ring Central put all its energy and investments in these next-generation services.""RingCentral's third quarter marked the first time since it was founded more than a decade ago that it did not log a loss. Earnings for the year are still expected to post a 13-cent per-share loss. Last year, RingCentral lost 49 cents a share. Analysts expect the company to see a 3-cent profit next year.Sales and marketing expenses have been relatively high, more than 40% of total revenue in a quarter. CEO Shmunis says spending is necessary ""to maintain and expand our leadership position in this very large market.""""We're growing 35% year-over-year. That's considered high as well,"" Shmunis said. ""For every dollar we spend, we get $8 in revenue. Our customers stay with us for a long time. We need to pay to acquire that customer.""Contracts range from monthly to three years; retention rates are high. Larger customers tend to sign three-year contracts.Partner And RivalRingCentral teams with AT&T, Telus (TU) in Canada and London-based BT Group (BT), which also are among its resellers. Since AT&T also has cloud solutions, it is both a partner and rival, Popova says.Compared with legacy business-phone systems, the so-called software unified communications market has turned the corner in recognizing the benefits and flexibility of SaaS, noted analyst Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets in a report. ""And RingCentral, with its leading market adoption, is well positioned to benefit.""Customers with more than 50 users are growing more than 100% a year and could represent 25% of the total, up from 20%, Sue noted.Larger customers with 1,000 or more users tend to adopt RingCentral's higher-priced premium and enterprise offerings.RingCentral's acquisition in June of the collaboration app Glip helped it land a major new customer in Q3, Columbia University, with 1,700 student and faculty users. Other customers with more than 1,000 ""seats"" include Dycom Industries (DY), PMC-Sierra (PMCS), Intuit (INTU) and Mindbody (MB), also a large new client win in Q3.Midmarket customers include cloud-based content collaboration outfit Box (BOX) and ride-sharing service Lyft.""Our customer base is diverse,"" Shmunis said. ""But we're over-represented in technology, real estate, medical, education and financial.""

220,INTU,"Tech companies are taking a pass on this year's Super Bowl.
"
221,INTU,"At this point, we could find only two tech companies, GoDaddy and Intuit (INTU), set to run ads for Super Bowl XLVIII on Feb. 2.
"
222,INTU,"Best Buy (BBY), BlackBerry (BBRY), Cars.com and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) opted out after running ads last year. CareerBuilder.com, Hulu and TaxAct, which advertised two years ago, are sitting out a second straight big game.
"
223,INTU,"The event, though, continues to be the single most-watched TV show of the year. Last year's Super Bowl had a U.S. TV audience of 108.4 million, making it the No. 3 most-viewed program in TV history. It trailed two earlier Super Bowls, 111.3 million viewers in 2011 and 111 million in 2010.
"
224,INTU,"Companies, though, have 4 million reasons to stay on the bench. The average price of a 30-second ad is $4 million, up from $3.7 million to $3.8 million last year.
"
225,INTU,"The thinning field of tech participants doesn't surprise Jeri Smith, chief executive of Communicus. The ad research company says its own study found just one in five ads from last year's game truly helped advertisers sell products.
"
226,INTU,"""A lot of these guys don't have money to waste,"" Smith said. ""If you're Coke or Pepsi, you don't really care because it's only $4 million. But smaller-budget advertisers really have to take a hard look.""
"
227,INTU,"Apple, Google Rarely In Game
"
228,INTU,"The tech firms with the most dough, for the most part, have skipped the big game. Apple's (AAPL) famed ""1984"" commercial — with the scrappy young Apple taking on the gray, old, Big Brotherish IBM stand-in — is among the most successful ads ever, but the company has refrained ever since. Google (GOOG), too, has run just one Super Bowl commercial. Spokespersons for both companies didn't return emails, but so far no signs have surfaced of any ad for the big game this year.
"
229,INTU,"Best Buy, facing plenty of other problems, is bowing out after sponsoring the game the last three years. It wants to be more flexible with its ad dollars, company spokesman Jon Sandler told IBD via email.
"
230,INTU,"""We look at all advertising opportunities, including the Super Bowl, on a case-by-case basis, and this year we made a deliberate decision to allocate our advertising dollars on a broader assortment of programming in order to connect with consumers,"" Sandler said.
"
231,INTU,"Online investment firm E-Trade and its ""talking baby"" commercials are on the sidelines after backing the game for six straight years.
"
232,INTU,"It wants to spread its ad dollars more evenly, Rich Muhlstock, E-Trade senior vice president of branding and acquisition, said in a company statement.
"
233,INTU,"Sports remains an important pillar for the company, he said, but ""we are broadening our mix to include other lifestyle environments that are also important to our audience."" Cars.com also is ending six straight years of Super Bowl ads.
"
234,INTU,"Last year, Cars.com, which helps consumers hook up with car dealers online, used the Super Bowl to launch its ""All Drive, No Drama"" marketing campaign.
"
235,INTU,"The company received ""fantastic results"" last year and sees no need for a repeat, Linda Bartman, Cars.com's chief marketing officer, told IBD via email.
"
236,INTU,"""Given this is the second year of the campaign, we don't feel that we need the Super Bowl as a platform to launch new creative and are instead going to increase our overall media weight throughout the entire year,"" she said.
"
237,INTU,"But Smith of Communicus says many advertisers simply fail to score. Her firm polled more than 1,000 consumers before and after last year's game.
"
238,INTU,"Consumers, she says, were unable to recall many ads.
"
239,INTU,"Cars.com is a Communicus customer.
"
240,INTU,"""We presented our results to Cars.com last year and customized our report for them, and that was one of the factors that led them to back out (this year),"" Smith said.
"
241,INTU,"Smith says consumers polled also had trouble connecting Samsung and its Galaxy phone with the two-minute ad the company ran last year, featuring actors Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd.
"
242,INTU,"""They were trying to be so clever that they forgot to sell the brand,"" she said.
"
243,INTU,"Samsung didn't respond to an email about this year's game.
"
244,INTU,"Tech companies expect a Super Bowl ad will boost website traffic, but that's not always the case.
"
245,INTU,"Last year, consumer traffic to Cars.com slipped to 6.9 million visitors in February from 7 million in January. Traffic did rise to 7.1 million in March, but then it dipped in subsequent months, says comScore Media Metrix.
"
246,INTU,"Traffic to Best Buy fell from 21.4 million visitors last January to 17.6 million in February, rose to 19.6 million in March, then slipped to 17 million-plus in both April and May.
"
247,INTU,"Traffic on E-Trade, though, rose from 1.2 million visitors in January to 1.3 million in February and 1.4 million in March, before sliding in the following months.
"
248,INTU,"But even a boost of, say, 1 million visitors in the month or two after the Super Bowl doesn't equate to success, Smith says.
"
249,INTU,"""How many of those inquiries actually translated into anything? That makes it hard to add up to an ROI,"" she said.
"
250,INTU,"GoDaddy Has Seen Success
"
251,INTU,"One exception might be GoDaddy, which often runs risque ads.
"
252,INTU,"The No. 1 seller of domain names and related Web services is returning for its 10th straight Super Bowl, with two 30-second ads.
"
253,INTU,"Last year, traffic to GoDaddy.com dipped to 4 million visitors in February from 4.1 million in January, then rose to 4.1 million in March, 4.4 million in April and 4.2 million in May.
"
254,INTU,"GoDaddy can trace some of its market share gains to its Super Bowl ads, Smith says.
"
255,INTU,"""GoDaddy has built their business based on a Super Bowl-focused ad buy, and their commercials are effective,"" she said. ""Nobody had ever heard of GoDaddy before they started advertising on the Super Bowl.""
"
256,INTU,"Intuit, a maker of tax-preparation and small-business software, is a Super Bowl advertising rookie.
"
257,INTU,"One 30-second spot will be given to the winner of a small-business contest the company held. The other offers a timely promo for the company's TurboTax software.

The S&P software industry is expected to have a relatively modest 10% rise in EPS, while internet software and services is expected to see profits explode 58%.Valuations in enterprise software are rich, and ""political-economic turbulence and currency"" risks could hurt Q2 results or guidance, analysts at Canaccord Genuity said in a June 24 report.""We recommend broadly trimming exposure to software, but strong underlying fundamentals for modern software companies will win out in the end, so investors should buy whatever dips might arise in midsummer,"" analysts wrote.Although iShares North America Tech Software includes Canadian companies, it is a predominantly U.S. portfolio.

273,INTU,"Shares of TurboTax software maker Intuit (INTU) were hammered in their worst fall in a decade, a day after CEO Brad Smith said the company was lowering its revenue guidance for its fiscal Q3 ending around April 30 and its fiscal year ending on or near July 30. Smith said in a statement that the Mountain View, Calif.-based company made…
"
274,INTU,"Most American consumers know by now that whatever the brand label on their electronics, most of them were made in the same network of factories in China. Shoppers at the website Monoprice.com follow this to its logical conclusion: Why not cut out the middlemen, and buy the gadgets straight from the Far East?
"
275,INTU,"Monoprice launched in 2002 selling cables and switches it had bought from Asia and offered at cut-rate prices thanks to its simplified supply chain. Since then, it's expanded into computer accessories and, more recently, audio and video equipment. And in August, it came to the stock market's attention when Blucora (BCOR) acquired it for $180 million.
"
276,INTU,"Search Engine Roots
"
277,INTU,"Blucora might have seemed an unlikely buyer for Monoprice, since the only thing the two companies had in common was the Internet. Up until 2012, Blucora was known as the search engine InfoSpace, a by-its-fingernails survivor of the dot-com boom and bust that experimented with various business models before stabilizing under the leadership of CEO William Ruckelshaus, who took the helm in 2010.
"
278,INTU,"In January 2012, however, it branched outside its core business by buying TaxAct, a provider of cloud-based tax-preparation software. Like Monoprice, TaxAct has carved out its place in a highly competitive market — dominated by Intuit (INTU) and H&R Block (HRB) — by undercutting its rivals on price.
"
279,INTU,"TaxAct has ""a product offering with substantially the same feature set as larger players in the space but at what we would characterize as a substantially more fair price for their filing,"" Ruckelshaus told the BMO Technology, Media & Entertainment Conference in December. ""The cornerstone of their offering is free federal filing for everybody regardless of your filing type or complexity or AGI (adjusted gross income), without any exclusions.""
"
280,INTU,"Another thing that TaxAct and Monoprice have in common is the potential that Ruckelshaus sees in them for expansion. He estimates that the digital do-it-yourself tax market is growing 4% to 6% a year, but the company has also been broadening its product offerings with sites designed to help people write up their own wills or navigate ObamaCare.
"
281,INTU,"Monoprice also continues to offer a wider variety of wares, with more than 5,000 kinds of product available at this point. Ruckelshaus believes the customer base can be expanded given the high satisfaction of existing customers — some 70% of reviews have given the site a 9 or 10 rating, he says. Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in his Dec. 31 initiation report that Monoprice should also benefit from secular growth.
"
282,INTU,"""Monoprice operates in large markets that are rapidly moving online,"" he wrote. ""Global consumer electronics is a $300 billion market growing at single digits. The $37 billion online subsegment is forecasted to grow approximately 15% annually through 2016, according to IDC.""

284,INTU,"Even so, the majority of Blucora's revenue — around 60% — is still coming from its core search business. The InfoSpace unit doesn't generate its own search results, but aggregates the results of other search engines through sites such as Dogpile and WebCrawler, as well as through its partners' properties and through the distribution of toolbars. It has more than 100 partners but about 31% of search revenue comes from the top five, led by Google (GOOG).
"
285,INTU,"Google has been the source of some concern for analysts, since early in 2013 it changed its software distribution policy in response to complaints about misleading toolbar downloads that wind up taking over the browser. Blucora changed its own policies in accord with Google's, which Fitzgerald says slowed search revenue growth by quite a bit last year — from 62.5% in the third quarter of 2012 to 17.9% in Q3 2013.
"
286,INTU,"Nonetheless, Blucora's third quarter handily beat expectations, sending its stock to a 12-year high. Profit rose 20% over the year-earlier quarter to 30 cents a share, nearly double analysts' consensus. Sales climbed 34% to $124 million, vs. analysts' estimate of $96 million.
"
287,INTU,"On the conference call to discuss results on Nov. 5, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria asked how the company had achieved such growth in its search revenue, given the policy changes.
"
288,INTU,"Ruckelshaus pointed to the advantage of using both the distribution-partner model and the owned-and-operated website model.
"
289,INTU,"""You're starting to see evidence of our taking advantage of that on the owned-and-operated side, which is really reverting back to where the company had its origins, which is as a consumer-facing provider of search solutions that are differentiated in their nature,"" he said. ""What you're seeing in recent periods is our ability to not just bring that product to market, but also to market it and promote it in a way that we think is a benefit to consumers and also a benefit to us.""
"
290,INTU,"Nonetheless, analysts still see an overhang in the expiration of InfoSpace's contract with Google at the end of the first quarter. Fitzgerald points out that both Google and Yahoo (YHOO), another major InfoSpace partner, have refused to renew contracts recently with partners who they thought were abusing their policies.
"
291,INTU,"However, Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris didn't sound worried in his Dec. 9 research note.
"
292,INTU,"""While customer concentration is indeed high, we do believe the agreement will be renewed at similar terms,"" he wrote.
"
293,INTU,"Analysts overall expect continued solid growth from Blucora. They estimate that fourth-quarter sales jumped 62% over the year-earlier quarter to $158 million, with profit rising 63% to 39 cents a share.Most American consumers know by now that whatever the brand label on their electronics, most of them were made in the same network of factories in China.

But Intuit's guidance for the current quarter missed analyst earnings and sales forecasts, though it reiterated its full-year guidance…
"
381,INTU,"Intuit (INTU) sure has many of the traits that appeal to dividend-seeking investors, even if it falls short as a CAN SLIM stock.The financial software maker has moved its dividend in the right direction. In August, it hiked the quarterly payout to 17 cents a share from 15 cents. That provides an annualized yield of about 1.1%.Intuit also has delivered an annual profit for 11 straight years, helping it earn a three-year EPS Stability Factor of 4 — close to the steadiest-possible level of 0.But IBD's CAN SLIM strategy emphasizes picking stocks that are showing strong gains in quarterly profit, and that's where Intuit falters. The Silicon Valley company always posts a loss in its October-ended fiscal first quarter, because it's so dependent on TurboTax and related products that don't sell strongly during that period.However, the company's CFO suggested to IBD in a September 2011 interview that Intuit is trying to address that. He said the growth of the Mint.com personal finance business, mobile initiatives and more will ""even out"" the company's results gradually.The company plans to post its results for Q1 2013, which ended Wednesday, on Nov. 15. Analysts expect a loss of 6 cents per share, smaller than the year-ago Q1 loss of 10 cents. In the three prior quarters, Intuit posted EPS gains of 59%, 6% and 200%.Q1 revenue is seen rising 8% to $639 million, after increases of 16%, 5% and 14% in the three prior periods.The stock has been trading in a narrow range for about eight months, running into resistance around 62. It's currently just 1% off its February high at 62.33. You could view the chart action as a long flat base with a 62.43 buy point.Note that Intuit has launched its biggest effort yet for growth outside the U.S., as IBD reported in an Oct. 4 article in its Internet & Technology section.The company, which relies on U.S. sales far more than most tech giants, is taking aim at small businesses worldwide with its QuickBooks Online bookkeeping service, the article said. Intuit currently gets about 95% of its revenue from the U.S. market.

382,INTU,"One of the worst aspects of tax season is having to pull together the yearlong piles of expenses and figure out which ones are deductible and to what extent.

Work is where big ideas happen, or so we hope.""Beyond Measure"" author Margaret Heffernan encourages incremental steps toward an inspirational culture. ""Small changes — listening, asking questions, sharing information — alter beyond measure the ideas, insights and connections those systems are capable of producing,"" she told IBD.Heffernan's first order: Think.""If we let it, our mind will wander beyond cliche, jargon, second-guessing,"" she said. Embrace stillness. Go to a meeting and say nothing. Just listen.Intuit (INTU) founder Scott Cook tunes in for surprises — comments that contradict or challenge his assumptions.As Ford Motor's (F) manager of global trends, Sheryl Connelly writes down anything with which she disagrees. Later she delves into that notebook for details ""she hadn't appreciated in the heat of the moment,"" Heffernan said. Probe. Murky ideas are easy to dismiss. Pixar President Ed Catmull told Heffernan most of the Disney (DIS) animation studio's blockbusters seem, initially, like clunkers. To ferret out winners, Pixar execs explore them all. ""The first glimmer of an idea or observation is like gold dust — highly cherished but hard to spot and not immediately valuable,"" said Heffernan. Reserve time. When Harvard University professor Leslie Perlow studied a software company, she noticed how engineers struggled to juggle routine meetings with time for creative work.Her proposal: Make 8 a.m. to noon three days a week quiet hours, during which no meetings or interruptions are allowed.Productivity soared — and workers became more respectful of others' time and were mindful to avoid unnecessary disruptions. Express. Every culture has reasons people avoid speaking up.Many cultures favor conformity.In Singapore, saving face is a priority. ""I've concluded that conflict aversion and a desire to please are universal, eviscerating our energy, initiative and our courage,"" Heffernan wrote. Invite dissent. Executives might assume reaching a consensus means everyone's communicating. The opposite is occurring.""Unanimity is always a sign that participation isn't wholehearted,"" Heffernan said.Make sure everyone's contributing thoughts, rather than staying mute to go with the group. Explore the fray. Instead of avoiding clashes at work, see those disagreements through — and pay attention to what lies under the surface of strife. ""Buried under the dragon's foot is always a gem — something to be learned from conflict,"" Heffernan said. Tune into discord.  Everyone doesn't have to get along to advance. ""Grumpy orchestras tend to play better and happiness is the output, not the input, of their work together,"" Heffernan said. Tap outside thoughts.  It's easy to think the office is where serious thinking happens, and what happens at home is trivial in comparison. ""This is a profound error,"" Heffernan said.A Procter & Gamble (PG) product manager told Heffernan a part-time worker became essential to the team by bringing the perspective of a typical consumer. Break away. Clear head space is essential. ""Volkswagen (VLKAY) turns off email outside of office hours,"" Heffernan said.

"
488,INTU,"One of the fastest growing of these so-called human-capital management, or HCM, cloud providers is Paycom Software (PAYC). It helps businesses automate and manage what it calls the ""complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement.""
"
489,INTU,"Founded in 1998 by CEO Chad Richison, Paycom has diversified from its roots in payroll processing into a broader range of HCM applications.
"
490,INTU,"Since the company went public in April 2014 at an offering price of 15, its stock has more than doubled. Revenue last year soared 40% to $151 million.
"
491,INTU,"Working New Angles
"
492,INTU,"A majority of Paycom's revenue still comes from payroll processing. But now payroll is a starting point: the firm upsells customers higher-margin HCM products that handle such things as talent acquisition and time and labor management.
"
493,INTU,"In December, Paycom launched a new ""dashboard"" to its existing compliance solution on the Affordable Care Act to navigate the new employer mandate that went into effect in January. Earlier this year Paycom rolled out a new ""learning management"" system.
"
494,INTU,"Paycom targets midsize companies with employees of 50 to 2,000. But some customers are larger, including three added in the fourth quarter. One longer-standing client employs more than 8,000.
"
495,INTU,"Paycom's services are delivered as a single software-as-a-service application, making use of a single, multi-tenant database. It's a relatively low-cost solution but one that still allows for decent returns, analysts say.
"
496,INTU,"""A lot of SaaS companies of this size are losing money. This company is making money, though not much,"" said Jim Macdonald, an analyst with First Analysis Securities.
"
497,INTU,"Small as that profit is, it is growing. In Q4, the company earned $3.1 million, or 6 cents per share, vs. a slight loss a year earlier.
"
498,INTU,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q1 earnings of 8 cents a share, up from 3 cents a year earlier. They see a 47% gain in full-year earnings to 28 cents on a per-share basis, up from 19 cents in 2014.
"
499,INTU,"In contrast, Paylocity (PCTY), which is viewed as Paycom's closest like-kind rival, has mostly logged quarterly losses, though revenue is growing at a fast clip.
"
500,INTU,"Revenue in Paycom's fourth quarter jumped 45% year-over-year to $44 million, the highest percentage gain in a long string of strong double-digit increases. Analysts expect revenue to climb another 31% this year to $197.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
501,INTU,"Sales People And Software
"
502,INTU,"Much of Paycom's success has to do with its integrated software, says Richard Davis, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.
"
503,INTU,"""But in the end a lot of it has to do with paying attention to customers,"" Davis said. ""It's good software with very good sales people.
"
504,INTU,"""The (sales reps) at Paycom are hustling. They're out knocking on doors. It's as old fashioned as any American business out there.""
"
505,INTU,"Racing For Customers
"
506,INTU,"Paycom opened five new sales offices in Q1, for 35 in total, all in the U.S. Paycom hires a lot of recent college graduates, with some work experience under their belts, and then trains them, Macdonald says.
"
507,INTU,"Pricing is based on the number of customers' employees and the number of apps utilized. Davis figures that Paycom would get $20 per month per employee if all its apps were utilized, up from a starting point of around $10 or less per month. However, that could take some time.
"
508,INTU,"""Right now it's a race to see who can get the customers,"" he said. ""It's like an open field and everyone is trying to get as many customers as they can. Once you land them they are sticky because it's a pain to switch.""
"
509,INTU,"Companies typically switch payroll/HCM vendors every five to 10 years, he says.
"
510,INTU,"At the end of 2014, Paycom served more than 12,000 clients and stored data for around 1.6 million of their employees.
"
511,INTU,"Its high customer retention rate — steady lately at 91% — is ""more reflective of an enterprise customer base and demonstrates the strategic value of Paycom's solutions,"" Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a research note.
"
512,INTU,"Another successful cloud-focused firm is Ultimate Software (ULTI), which saw revenue rise 23% in 2014 to $505.9 million.
"
513,INTU,"Not to be left behind, much bigger incumbents with legacy technology are expanding into cloud solutions. Automatic Data Processing (ADP), for example, is ""heavily investing in and quickly transitioning clients to new platforms,"" noted JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy in a research note.
"
514,INTU,"Paychex (PAYX), which targets small-to-midsize firms, has added an SaaS platform called SurePayroll, he added.
"
515,INTU,"Citing industry estimates in government filings, Paycom sizes the U.S. market for HCM applications in 2015 at roughly $7 billion, excluding payroll services. For payroll services alone it's an estimated $16.8 billion. But more ""narrowly defined"" to address the midmarket cloud space Paycom targets, Davis says the firm's addressable market is much smaller, perhaps $3 billion or more — ""still plenty big.""
"
516,INTU,"""In a given year by our math $200 or $300 million in contracts are up in the air to be won"" by Paycom, Davis said.
"
517,INTU,"In payroll outsourcing, Paycom is displacing incumbents such as ADP, privately held Ceridian, Paychex and Intuit (INTU), Murphy notes. And in broader HCM solutions it's homing in on the likes of the fast-growing Workday (WDAY) as well as Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD).

524,INTU,"Bob Parsons is proof that a mix of preparation, perseverance and a little luck can spark success.
"
525,INTU,"The 60-year-old founder and CEO of Go Daddy overcame academic malaise, a war injury and no formal computer science education to build the No. 1 Web domain registration and hosting business.
"
526,INTU,"In July, private investors plunked down a reported $2.25 billion for a majority stake.
"
527,INTU,"Since its launch in 1997, Go Daddy has combined competitive pricing and snappy TV ads along with superior technology and customer service to create a billion-dollar company that manages 49 million domain names worldwide.
"
528,INTU,"Go, Go, Go
"
529,INTU,"Go Daddy is known for going its own way. The company has wrangled with TV network censors to get its ads approved. It has also continued to pay top prices for Super Bowl ads and host an extravagant annual holiday party for its employees in recessionary times.
"
530,INTU,"Parsons offers no apologies for his approach.
"
531,INTU,"""Everything we do goes against the grain — that is why we are who we are and why we have accomplished what we have accomplished,"" he told IBD.
"
532,INTU,"Go Daddy has become a one-stop shop for Web services. Customers are mostly small businesses. This year the company expects revenue of $1.1 billion, up 20% from 2010.
"
533,INTU,"Go Daddy's aggressive strategy of paying for Super Bowl ads and posting so-called uncensored versions of the ads on its website goes a long way to separate the company from its rivals, says Melanie Posey, an analyst for the a research firm IDC.
"
534,INTU,"""Shock value can do a lot for you,"" she said. ""Even if you don't know much about Web hosting, you know who Go Daddy is.""
"
535,INTU,"Go Daddy's advertised persona is emblematic of its founder, says Warren Adelman, the company's chief operating officer.
"
536,INTU,"""He is a very direct guy; there is no opaqueness with Bob. He just says it like it is,"" Adelman said. ""People always say the joke of 'thinking outside the box.' Well, I would say that Bob lives way outside the box.""
"
537,INTU,"Parsons was born in Baltimore, the son of a furniture salesman. In grade school the boy was nothing short of incorrigible.
"
538,INTU,"""I'd start the day with a couple of new pencils, and a lot of times when the day was done I would have that yellow paint all over my lips and hands after I chewed them all up,"" he said. ""I just wasn't doing the job.""
"
539,INTU,"Parsons' lackluster attitude toward education continued in high school. An option? During his senior year in 1968, two friends convinced him to join in on a visit to a Marine Corps recruiting office.
"
540,INTU,"To The Front
"
541,INTU,"Parsons vividly recalls the recruiting officer's performance: ""He said, 'I'd pour you men a drink, but I'm all out right now.' I mean, the guy played us like a fiddle.""
"
542,INTU,"Parsons signed up. Combat duty in Vietnam followed a year later. Soon he tripped over a wire tied to a hand grenade, blasting his legs and an arm. He spent two months recovering in a hospital in Japan.
"
543,INTU,"By 1970, he was a steelworker back home. That convinced him to reconsider school.
"
544,INTU,"By the mid-'70s he had graduated with honors from the University of Baltimore and passed the Certified Public Accountant exam.
"
545,INTU,"While in California for a business meeting in 1977, he bought a book on computers. He zipped through it and on the flight home wrote a program for managing leases.
"
546,INTU,"Into Tech
"
547,INTU,"""I was hooked,"" he said. ""Anytime I had a repetitive type job, I wrote a little basic program to do it. That's how I got into this technology business.""
"
548,INTU,"He became so proficient, he launched Parsons Technology in the basement of his home in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1984 to sell the software to others.
"
549,INTU,"In 1994 he sold the company for $64 million to business software company Intuit (INTU).
"
550,INTU,"Three years later he launched Jomax Technologies, which started out building websites for companies. Clients then asked for software to build sites themselves.
"
551,INTU,"Soon Parsons noticed a growing demand for Web addresses. And he saw that many of the firms handling domain sales were poorly managed.
"
552,INTU,"""The domain name registrars were train wrecks back then, so we decided we could sell registrations for less money and we could attract people that way and sell them software,"" he said.
"
553,INTU,"In 1999 his firm had a new name, Go Daddy. Why that title? Parsons liked the ""Daddy"" part and also the AOL keyword ""Go"" command, says Barbara Rechterman, the firm's chief marketing officer.
"
554,INTU,"""He said 'we need something that is cool, that is different' and then it just kind of stuck,"" she said.
"
555,INTU,"Go Daddy was growing. But not fast enough for Parsons. In 2004 he hired a research firm to find out why. The firm said Go Daddy was virtually unknown because it had advertised solely on the Web.
"
556,INTU,"That was enough for Parsons. He decided to run one 30-second TV ad during the February 2005 Super Bowl. The ad was a spoof on singer Janet Jackson's halftime show blunder of the year before.
"
557,INTU,"Parsons aimed for the millions of people who watch the Super Bowl not for the football, but for the commercials. The strategy scored.
"
558,INTU,"Go Daddy's market share of managed domain names soared from 16% to 25% in one week. The Super Bowl ad was pivotal, recalls Go Daddy's Adelman.
"
559,INTU,"""We really put our mark on the industry, and it helped get us on an accelerated growth path,"" he said.
"
560,INTU,"Go Daddy has placed at least one ad in each Super Bowl since then. It has also sponsored sports events and featured auto racer Danica Patrick in some of its ads.
"
561,INTU,"""We took something that is about as exciting as a cup of sawdust, registering domain names, and we made it cool,"" Parsons said .
"
562,INTU,"Talent Touch
"
563,INTU,"Parsons' penchant for the edge extends to his employees. Before becoming Go Daddy's chief marketing officer, Rechterman managed development teams at Parsons Technology. She had worked as a CPA with no marketing experience, but did that faze the boss? No.
"
564,INTU,"""He challenges you in terms of pushing you out of your comfort zone, and I believe that is why the business grows as quickly as it grows,"" she said.
"
565,INTU,"Go Daddy's 3,250 employees can also count on Parsons sparing no expense, especially for their Christmas party. Last year's event, held at Chase Field in Phoenix, featured the rock band ZZ Top and carnival rides. It cost over $2 million.
"
566,INTU,"For Parsons, the bash is a way to achieve No. 16 on his list of rules for success in business and life: ""There is always a reason to smile, especially if you go to our holiday party.""Bob Parsons is proof that a mix of preparation, perseverance and a little luck can spark success.The 60-year-old founder and CEO of Go Daddy overcame academic malaise, a war injury and no formal computer science education to build the No. 1 Web domain registration and hosting business.In July, private investors plunked down a reported $2.25 billion for a majority stake.Since its launch in 1997, Go Daddy has combined competitive pricing and snappy TV ads along with superior technology and customer service to create a billion-dollar company that manages 49 million domain names worldwide.Go, Go, GoGo Daddy is known for going its own way.

""Even if you don't know much about Web hosting, you know who Go Daddy is.""Go Daddy's advertised persona is emblematic of its founder, says Warren Adelman, the company's chief operating officer.""He is a very direct guy; there is no opaqueness with Bob. He just says it like it is,"" Adelman said. ""People always say the joke of 'thinking outside the box.' Well, I would say that Bob lives way outside the box.""Parsons was born in Baltimore, the son of a furniture salesman. In grade school the boy was nothing short of incorrigible.""I'd start the day with a couple of new pencils, and a lot of times when the day was done I would have that yellow paint all over my lips and hands after I chewed them all up,"" he said. ""I just wasn't doing the job.""Parsons' lackluster attitude toward education continued in high school. An option? During his senior year in 1968, two friends convinced him to join in on a visit to a Marine Corps recruiting office.To The FrontParsons vividly recalls the recruiting officer's performance: ""He said, 'I'd pour you men a drink, but I'm all out right now.' I mean, the guy played us like a fiddle.""Parsons signed up. Combat duty in Vietnam followed a year later. Soon he tripped over a wire tied to a hand grenade, blasting his legs and an arm. He spent two months recovering in a hospital in Japan.By 1970, he was a steelworker back home. That convinced him to reconsider school.By the mid-'70s he had graduated with honors from the University of Baltimore and passed the Certified Public Accountant exam.While in California for a business meeting in 1977, he bought a book on computers. He zipped through it and on the flight home wrote a program for managing leases.Into Tech""I was hooked,"" he said. ""Anytime I had a repetitive type job, I wrote a little basic program to do it. That's how I got into this technology business.""He became so proficient, he launched Parsons Technology in the basement of his home in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1984 to sell the software to others.In 1994 he sold the company for $64 million to business software company Intuit (INTU).Three years later he launched Jomax Technologies, which started out building websites for companies. Clients then asked for software to build sites themselves.Soon Parsons noticed a growing demand for Web addresses. And he saw that many of the firms handling domain sales were poorly managed.""The domain name registrars were train wrecks back then, so we decided we could sell registrations for less money and we could attract people that way and sell them software,"" he said.In 1999 his firm had a new name, Go Daddy. Why that title? Parsons liked the ""Daddy"" part and also the AOL keyword ""Go"" command, says Barbara Rechterman, the firm's chief marketing officer.""He said 'we need something that is cool, that is different' and then it just kind of stuck,"" she said.Go Daddy was growing. But not fast enough for Parsons. In 2004 he hired a research firm to find out why. The firm said Go Daddy was virtually unknown because it had advertised solely on the Web.That was enough for Parsons. He decided to run one 30-second TV ad during the February 2005 Super Bowl. The ad was a spoof on singer Janet Jackson's halftime show blunder of the year before.Parsons aimed for the millions of people who watch the Super Bowl not for the football, but for the commercials. The strategy scored.Go Daddy's market share of managed domain names soared from 16% to 25% in one week. The Super Bowl ad was pivotal, recalls Go Daddy's Adelman.""We really put our mark on the industry, and it helped get us on an accelerated growth path,"" he said.Go Daddy has placed at least one ad in each Super Bowl since then. It has also sponsored sports events and featured auto racer Danica Patrick in some of its ads.""We took something that is about as exciting as a cup of sawdust, registering domain names, and we made it cool,"" Parsons said .Talent TouchParsons' penchant for the edge extends to his employees. Before becoming Go Daddy's chief marketing officer, Rechterman managed development teams at Parsons Technology. She had worked as a CPA with no marketing experience, but did that faze the boss? No.""He challenges you in terms of pushing you out of your comfort zone, and I believe that is why the business grows as quickly as it grows,"" she said.Go Daddy's 3,250 employees can also count on Parsons sparing no expense, especially for their Christmas party. Last year's event, held at Chase Field in Phoenix, featured the rock band ZZ Top and carnival rides. It cost over $2 million.For Parsons, the bash is a way to achieve No. 16 on his list of rules for success in business and life: ""There is always a reason to smile, especially if you go to our holiday party.""
"
567,INTU,"The Super Bowl is becoming a game of soaring costs and more conservative game plans for tech companies.As usual, few tech companies are playing the ad game for the show that consistently is the most viewed of the year. That viewership carries a price: The cost of a 30-second ad in this year's game telecast is $4.4 million to $4.5 million, up from $4 million last year.Longtime players GoDaddy and Intuit (INTU) are in, but are cutting back. Regular big-game advertisers BlackBerry (BBRY) and Cars.com are staying on the sidelines for a second straight year. (Past advertisers E-Trade (ETFC), Hulu and Best Buy (BBY) declined to say if they would, or wouldn't, run ads this time.)But the Feb. 1 telecast is attracting some tech rookies. Recent IPO Wix.com (WIX) and privately held Mophie are making their Super Bowl ad debuts. Privately held Squarespace is suiting up for a second consecutive appearance.Last year's game, won handily by the Seattle Seahawks over the Denver Broncos, scored a record audience of 111.48 million viewers, edging the previous record of 111.34 million who tuned in to watch Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, says market tracker Nielsen.GoDaddy has been one of the Super Bowl's most consistent tech advertisers. The Web domain and services company has paid for two 30-second ads in most years since it began backing the game 11 years ago, but will run just a single 30-second spot this time.GoDaddy Focuses ElsewhereThe company still believes in the Super Bowl, but for now it's focused on directing more of its marketing budget to expand its business offshore, says Barb Rechterman, GoDaddy's chief marketing officer.""We have expanded our international footprint, with Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 marketing spends in Latin America and Europe, as well as India,"" she told IBD. ""As we grow globally, we're more focused on sharing the marketing dollars.""Intuit also is scaling back for an event well-timed for the company, as it comes near the start of the tax season.The business and tax software maker will have just one 60-second spot this year vs. one 60-second and one 30-second ad last year.Intuit's single ad will focus on its TurboTax tax preparation software, Intuit spokeswoman Colleen Gatlin said via email. ""Last year was a strong year where TurboTax units grew 14% year-over-year, as the do-it-yourself category grew 6% over the prior year, making tax software the fastest-growing tax preparation choice for U.S. taxpayers,"" she wrote.Cars.com dropped out last year after running ads the previous six games, and it's idle again this year.Closing the door on the Super Bowl opens opportunities elsewhere, Linda Bartman, Cars.com's chief marketing officer, said in an email.""By shifting our spending away from the Super Bowl, it allowed (us) to be on air, in front of even more car shoppers more frequently throughout the entire year,"" she wrote. ""We saw very positive results from our efforts and want to exceed those in 2015.""The Super Bowl, though, continues to attract some new tech players.Squarespace, a Web services company, is returning with one 30-second ad after backing the game for the first time last year, according to Advertising Age magazine.The two known rookie tech advertisers, Mophie and Wix.com, each plan to run one 30-second ad.Mophie sells battery cases and related accessories for mobile devices, while Wix helps its customers develop websites and Web services.Like other advertisers, Mophie is counting on the Super Bowl providing immediate consumer awareness for its products, says Kevin Malinowski, Mophie's marketing manager, in an email.""Most mobile users today are unaware these products even exist,"" he said. ""Broadcast advertising is one avenue we haven't taken in the past, but it's certainly one that amplifies the loudest. As a brand, Mophie is bold. So when discussions began around broadcast advertising, we naturally honed in on the biggest, boldest spot available.""Wix has no misgivings about the Super Bowl's costly entry fee, says Eric Mason, Wix's director of strategic marketing and communications.""We didn't set the price,"" Mason told IBD. ""We wanted to tell our story and find the biggest stage in which to do it, and this is the logical place to be.""Targets Only Helena, Mont.The Verge, the technology news website owned by privately held digital publisher Vox Media, is also running a Super Bowl ad, but just in one small market, Helena, Mont., population 28,000. It will pay $700 for the ad. Vox confirms the ad but isn't saying much about what could be sort of a test. The ad is already up on The Verge's YouTube channel. The commercial shows The Verge as part of ""the future.""Comcast's (CMCSA) NBC is televising this year's game and is making it a free streaming event for all, with hopes the move will promote the cable giant's ""TV Anywhere"" initiative. And the game will be played at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., near Phoenix. The home of the Arizona Cardinals NFL team is operated by ... another unit of Comcast. It doesn't appear Comcast is running any ads during the game, though.Do tech companies get much of a return from Super Bowl ads?The number of unique visitors to GoDaddys's website fell 5.6% last February vs. January despite its commercial that aired during the Feb. 2, 2014, Super Bowl between Seattle and Denver, but traffic jumped 90.5% in March vs. February, according to market tracker ComScore.Squarespace.com's traffic, similarly, fell 11.3% last February vs. January but soared 143% in March vs. February.The traffic spikes in March for both sites aren't necessarily Super Bowl-related, ComScore analyst Adam Lella said via email.""It might be difficult to attribute that (March gain) to the Super Bowl ads,"" he wrote.Traffic to Intuit's websites rose 39% in February vs. January but then fell 26% in March vs. February. Traffic remained steady from March through April, during income-tax season.Web traffic to Wix.com last year remained steady at more than 6 million unique visitors a month from January through April.The company has 58 million users worldwide who use its website design software and services for free, and another 1.4 million users who pay for the company's advanced services.The Super Bowl ad, says Mason, could boost those numbers.""For us, it's about brand building and letting people know who we are as a company,"" he said. ""We are probably one of the larger big companies that nobody has heard about.""

609,INTU,"Shares of Redbox parent Outerwall (OUTR) tumbled Tuesday after the company announced that Scott Di Valerio has stepped down as CEO and resigned from the board, a major red flag coming just two weeks before Outerwall is due to report Q4 earnings.Outerwall was down 17% in midday trading in the stock market today, at a two-month low near 64.50.Outerwall narrowed its fourth-quarter guidance at or above its previous guidance range to assuage investors. It now expects Q4 sales of $598 million to $602 million and earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.52. Based on the midpoint of its guidance, EPS would be up 46% to $2.46 and sales would be up 1% to $600 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling Outerwall to earn $2.06 a share on sales of $596 million. Outerwall is scheduled to report Q4 earnings after the market close on Feb. 5.Outerwall is expected to provide 2015 guidance on its Q4 earnings conference call. The Bellevue, Wash.-based company sees low single-digit revenue growth and core adjusted earnings from continuing operations to be in line with expected 2014 results.Nora Denzel, a member of Outerwall's board since February 2013, was appointed interim CEO. Denzel held various management positions at Intuit (INTU) from February 2008 through August 2012. Before that, she was senior vice president of the global software business unit and the storage and consulting divisions at Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) from August 2000 to February 2006. She also previously worked at Legato Systems and IBM (IBM).The resignation of Di Valerio blind-sided Wall Street. Outerwall stock on Friday reached an all-time high of 77.94.""The timing of this transition signals the board's dissatisfaction with the company's strategic direction and desire to bring in new blood,"" Dougherty & Co. analyst Steven Frankel said in a note Tuesday. ""The resignation of Mr. Di Valero clears the decks for the company to appoint an outsider as CEO, as opposed to in 2013 when the board chose Mr. Di Valero, who was then the company's CFO.""The company's raised guidance for Q4 EPS was a positive, but its 2015 guidance disappointed, Frankel said.The Q4 EPS upside is likely the result of a combination of share buybacks and lower-than-expected taxes, Frankel said.For 2015, Wall Street was looking for year-over-year growth of 5% in sales and 7% in adjusted earnings. That compares with management's target of low single-digit sales growth and flat earnings.""While in the short run strong cash generation from Redbox can drive continued share repurchases, we remain concerned that the inherent volatility of the box office combined with the rise of digital distribution and the shift toward episodic television pose serious challenges,"" Frankel said. The failure of its joint venture with Verizon (VZ) leaves Redbox without a digital strategy.""Without a clear vision on how the company drives per kiosk rental growth at Redbox and meets the challenges of the digital world, we remain Neutral rated,"" Frankel said.Outerwall is likely being conservative with its 2015 forecast because of the CEO transition and other ""moving parts,"" such as the recent Redbox price increase, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note Tuesday.In addition to its Redbox movie rental business, Outerwall runs Coinstar coin-counting kiosks, ecoATM mobile phone trade-in kiosks and is testing other in-store kiosks.RELATED:Redbox tells DVD movie renters to dig deeperRedbox Q3 profit growth surprises, adds loyalty program.

610,INTU,"Personal Finance Action Plan For 2015
"
611,INTU,"Managing your personal finances today isn't as simple as it once was — not only are there more things than ever to spend money on, there are also more ways to spend. Luckily technology tools, both websites and apps, also have proliferated.
"
612,INTU,"E-commerce has made shopping as much a part of daily household life as doing laundry or watching TV. And payment services like Paypal, Google Wallet and Apple Pay make it easier than ever to blow money even when you don't have any cash on hand. They all add challenges for your personal finance strategies for 2015, but several offer solutions too.
"
613,INTU,"Meanwhile, the growing sea of credit cards, replete with confusing cash-back offers and promotional interest rates, has made access to credit easier and more complex than ever.
"
614,INTU,"So when it comes to using tech tools to manage finances, what applications and Internet sites should consumers turn to?
"
615,INTU,"There's no easy answer. But as one financial expert sees it, it should come down to what feels right to each individual.
"
616,INTU,"""People should use whatever tools or strategies they're most comfortable with,"" Farnoosh Torabi, a financial strategist and correspondent for money-management site NerdWallet.com — and whose Twitter feed (@Farnoosh) boasts nearly 19,000 followers — said in an email interview. ""If you're a pen-and-paper type of person, then start with that.
"
617,INTU,"""The point is, you want to get in the habit of tracking your money regularly, and the only way you're going to do it is if you feel comfortable doing it and you enjoy doing it.""
"
618,INTU,"Torabi started in her early 20s by using Excel spreadsheets to design a budget. But as she grew more comfortable, she turned to Mint, owned by Intuit (INTU) and one of the most popular mobile apps for tracking your money.
"
619,INTU,"""Mint is great because it allows you to see all your various accounts in one place. It's a virtual dashboard,"" Torabi said.
"
620,INTU,"But Mint isn't the only site she likes.
"
621,INTU,"""A new financial tool called Level Money is similar but has the added bonus of letting you see how much money you have left to spend for the day, week or month,"" she said. ""It's like having an accountability partner.""
"
622,INTU,"Privately held Level Money is based in San Francisco.
"
623,INTU,"Torabi also recommends that people use their bank's mobile app, which is typically free, for things such as tracking spending, depositing checks and finding nearby ATMs that won't charge fees.
"
624,INTU,"For those who are wary of free money-management apps, there are tools like Spendee ($2 on both Apple's (AAPL) App Store and Google's (GOOGL) Google Play) or the less-static You Need a Budget, which requires users to pay $60 for the desktop app before being able to use the mobile versions of its ""living budget"" approach to money management.
"
625,INTU,"If getting on top of credit-card debt is the goal, then sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame help consumers access their credit reports for free, better understand their debt and shop for the right credit cards to match their priorities.
"
626,INTU,"Good Habits Always Key
"
627,INTU,"None of this is to suggest money-management websites and apps are a panacea for poor money habits. Most of them simply enforce the habits consumers bring to them.
"
628,INTU,"""Are these tools actually getting us to save better or save more? I wish I could say yes, resoundingly,"" said Torabi.
"
629,INTU,"""But a tool, in and of itself, can't really do that on its own,"" she continued. ""Improvement comes from the person; from the person's own motivation, determination and hard work. If you're not good with money and you have bad habits and you're not willing to change, having a Mint account isn't really your savior.""
"
630,INTU,"Using online tools and mobile applications also presents some risk, notes Victor Ricciardi, assistant professor of financial management at Goucher College in Baltimore and co-author of the book ""Investor Behavior: The Psychology of Financial Planning and Investing,"" published in early 2014.
"
631,INTU,"Ricciardi and co-author H. Kent Baker found there are more than 100 risk-tolerance questionnaires now being used by various online tools and applications.
"

"
638,INTU,"Rather than recommend mobile apps or money management sites, Bleeck advises clients to seek information that challenges their assumptions.
"
639,INTU,"The problem with the glut of tech tools, Bleeck contends, is that they often mask a growing flaw in people's relationship with money: They're using all the tools to help them control their spending instead of teaching themselves how to save.
"
640,INTU,"""The best way to make money is not to spend it, and that's not in this culture anymore,"" Bleeck lamented.

642,INTU,"""I do strongly think that having some sort of online dashboard with your accounts listed is helpful. That's a pretty powerful thing,"" she said. ""When you can see all your assets and liabilities in one place, that sort of visualization makes your financial life a concrete reality. There's no more guessing.""Personal Finance Action Plan For 2015Managing your personal finances today isn't as simple as it once was — not only are there more things than ever to spend money on, there are also more ways to spend. Luckily technology tools, both websites and apps, also have proliferated.E-commerce has made shopping as much a part of daily household life as doing laundry or watching TV. And payment services like Paypal, Google Wallet and Apple Pay make it easier than ever to blow money even when you don't have any cash on hand. They all add challenges for your personal finance strategies for 2015, but several offer solutions too.Meanwhile, the growing sea of credit cards, replete with confusing cash-back offers and promotional interest rates, has made access to credit easier and more complex than ever.So when it comes to using tech tools to manage finances, what applications and Internet sites should consumers turn to?There's no easy answer. But as one financial expert sees it, it should come down to what feels right to each individual.""People should use whatever tools or strategies they're most comfortable with,"" Farnoosh Torabi, a financial strategist and correspondent for money-management site NerdWallet.com — and whose Twitter feed (@Farnoosh) boasts nearly 19,000 followers — said in an email interview. ""If you're a pen-and-paper type of person, then start with that.""The point is, you want to get in the habit of tracking your money regularly, and the only way you're going to do it is if you feel comfortable doing it and you enjoy doing it.""Torabi started in her early 20s by using Excel spreadsheets to design a budget. But as she grew more comfortable, she turned to Mint, owned by Intuit (INTU) and one of the most popular mobile apps for tracking your money.""Mint is great because it allows you to see all your various accounts in one place. It's a virtual dashboard,"" Torabi said.But Mint isn't the only site she likes.""A new financial tool called Level Money is similar but has the added bonus of letting you see how much money you have left to spend for the day, week or month,"" she said. ""It's like having an accountability partner.""Privately held Level Money is based in San Francisco.Torabi also recommends that people use their bank's mobile app, which is typically free, for things such as tracking spending, depositing checks and finding nearby ATMs that won't charge fees.For those who are wary of free money-management apps, there are tools like Spendee ($2 on both Apple's (AAPL) App Store and Google's (GOOGL) Google Play) or the less-static You Need a Budget, which requires users to pay $60 for the desktop app before being able to use the mobile versions of its ""living budget"" approach to money management.If getting on top of credit-card debt is the goal, then sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame help consumers access their credit reports for free, better understand their debt and shop for the right credit cards to match their priorities.Good Habits Always KeyNone of this is to suggest money-management websites and apps are a panacea for poor money habits. Most of them simply enforce the habits consumers bring to them.""Are these tools actually getting us to save better or save more? I wish I could say yes, resoundingly,"" said Torabi.""But a tool, in and of itself, can't really do that on its own,"" she continued. ""Improvement comes from the person; from the person's own motivation, determination and hard work. If you're not good with money and you have bad habits and you're not willing to change, having a Mint account isn't really your savior.""Using online tools and mobile applications also presents some risk, notes Victor Ricciardi, assistant professor of financial management at Goucher College in Baltimore and co-author of the book ""Investor Behavior: The Psychology of Financial Planning and Investing,"" published in early 2014.Ricciardi and co-author H. Kent Baker found there are more than 100 risk-tolerance questionnaires now being used by various online tools and applications.The lack of a standard questionnaire for determining investors' appetites for risk, Ricciardi says, could be causing sites and apps to mismatch users with the wrong tendencies.""The emergence of behavioral finance is causing risk-tolerance questionnaires to be an area of focus,"" Ricciardi told IBD.

644,INTU,"A better asset than knowledge? The ability to learn. How strivers always seek:• Keep up. What you knew yesterday may not apply tomorrow, thanks to quickly advancing technologies like the Internet of Things and smart robots.""It's going to shorten the shelf life of knowledge,"" said Edward Hess, author of ""Learn or Die.""A company's operational excellence and ability to innovate depend on savvy thinking.""Being smart is not knowing everything anymore. It's knowing how to learn,"" Hess told IBD.• Stay open. Intuit (INTU), one of a handful of companies that Hess studied, has taken an aggressive approach to becoming a learning organization. To boost thinking, the software firm launched a ""Design for Delight"" approach to innovation in 2007. It emphasizes being open-minded, exploring options and experimenting rapidly.Last year, Intuit founder Scott Cook urged staffers to ponder: ""Surprises happen, and sometimes that is the market speaking out to you, telling you something you didn't know.""• Mix it up. We're conditioned to look for similarities and make connections. ""We're not trained to look for aberrations or anomalies,"" Hess said. But that's exactly what you should do for insight. He likens the process to taking a puzzle apart and putting together pieces that don't fit. Innovation comes from ""connecting things in different ways.""• Predict downfalls. How about theoretically killing off your company? That's what's done with a premortem model of thinking.""The easiest way to do this is to write a corporate obituary of the death and demise of XYZ company,"" Hess said. By predicting failure, you better grasp what could go wrong and how to recognize warning signs. ""You have created some memory traces. You'll be more likely to see these things coming.""• Take a moment. ""So much of learning is about slowing down to think ... and listening without ego,"" Hess said. Before proceeding with a plan, smart executives pause to visualize how it will go. ""They ask: What doesn't feel right?""Called a recognition-primed decision model, this approach makes time for chiefs to notice red flags.• Replay it. For another way to cogitate, Hess recommends the Army's After-Action Review.It prompts soldiers post-mission to ask what happened, what didn't work, what worked well, what could be done better. For professionals, ""it should be standard procedure every day,"" Hess said.• Start from zero. ""Why are you often at your best when you are new to an undertaking, doing something for the first time?""Author Liz Wiseman posed that question in ""Rookie Smarts: Why Learning Beats Knowing in the New Game of Work.""Newbies realize that they don't know enough. Wiseman lived that phenomenon at Oracle (ORCL) as a young executive charged with building a corporate university.With little direction and no grand vision, she talked to anyone who would help close her knowledge gap. ""Mine was a humility born of desperation,"" she wrote.• Step lightly. What did Wiseman learn from that successful effort?Lacking knowledge and experience, rookies are open to exploring new concepts.They benefit from taking the hunter-gatherer approach: seeking out experts and gaining their insights.Unsure of the correct path forward, smart pioneers take small, calculated steps and pause to make sure they're on track.

758,INTU,"The initiative broadened Constant Contact's customer base and helped the company become more competitive against rivals such as MailChimp, MyEmma and Vocus' (VOCS) iContact.
"
759,INTU,"But it also took Constant Contact's focus off its core email products, which in turn hurt the company's financial returns.
"

"
761,INTU,"""They lost focus on their flagship product,"" said Jeff Houston, an analyst at Barrington Research. ""Their customer retention rates fell and their conversion rates fell, too. They had too much going on.""
"

"

"
769,INTU,"Meanwhile, Constant Contact has worked to get its name in front of more people by signing strategic partnerships with high-profile firms. During the third quarter it struck a deal with office retailer Staples (SPLS) to host online marketing workshops in select Staples stores, for example.
"
770,INTU,"In October, Constant Contact announced the launch of a new program with Microsoft (MSFT) to provide best practices in online marketing in Microsoft retail stores across North America.
"
771,INTU,"Financially, Constant Contact is coming off its best quarter in a year-and-a-half. It logged Q3 earnings of 29 cents a share, up from 20 cents a year earlier and a nickel above consensus views.
"
772,INTU,"Revenue for the quarter gained 13% to $72 million, in line with estimates. The company's average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) climbed 4% to $42.13. Constant Contact also recorded a drop in its cost to acquire customers and an increase in its average customer life.
"
773,INTU,"It was the second straight quarter that Constant Contact's customer lifetime value metrics improved, analyst Houston said. These metrics include ARPU, retention rates, growth margins and cost of acquiring customers.
"
774,INTU,"""Prior to last quarter its customer lifetime value declined for two years,"" Houston said.
"
775,INTU,"Constant Contact shares touched an 18-month high of 29.71 on Oct. 25 and currently trade near 28. Analysts expect the company to grow full-year earnings 30% in 2013 and 29% in 2014.

784,INTU,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 20. The company’s revenues are likely to benefit from increasing adoption of its QuickBooks and TurboTax products. However, escalating expenses due to increased investments may hurt profitability.QuickBooks to Drive RevenuesThe company’s QuickBooks product offers financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses. The company has been witnessing tremendous growth in the QuickBooks online subscriber base, which is driving its Small Business Group segment’s revenues.The business and financial software space in which Intuit operates has huge growth opportunities. Notably, there are more than 29 million small businesses in the United States, of which majority still depend on third party or accountants to conduct data-entry process, as they feel it is a tedious and complex task.Therefore, to reach the untapped market, the company has introduced more convenient and easy-to-use version of its QuickBooks, which have been displaying remarkable results. In fiscal 2017, Intuit witnessed a 58% surge in its QuickBooks online subscribers which reached 2.38 million. QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers also increased to 390,000 from 85,000 at the end of fiscal 2016.The company forecasts year-over-year growth in the range of 37-42% in the QuickBooks online subscriber base. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal first quarter with a subscriber base of 2.475 million, marking year-over-year improvement of 51%.The tremendous increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive the company’s Small Business Group segment’s revenues.TurboTax Continues to Fuel RevenuesThe increasing adoption for the company’s TurboTax products — which offer income tax preparation products and services — continues to drive its Consumer Tax segment’s revenues. Notably, the segment had witnessed a 9% year-over-year increase in fiscal 2017 revenues, mainly driven by a 2% rise in TurboTax federal units and a shift in product mix.The company’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The analysts covering the stock expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thereby boosting the overall top-line performance. Furthermore, the company’s TurboTax products derive high margins which will likely cushion its bottom-line results.Elevated Expenses to Hurt ProfitabilityIntuit’s high costs and expenses remain a major concern. In addition, during the last quarterly earnings conference call, the company had hinted that it would increase investments in engineering and marketing to grab the growing opportunity globally. Therefore, analysts are cautious about the company’s bottom-line results.What Does the Zacks Consensus Estimate Say?Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $855 million, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter. However, earnings are projected at 5 cents per share — reflecting an estimated year-over-year decline of 23.6%.Furthermore, our proven model does not conclusively show that Intuit is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

785,INTU,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 25 stocks that qualified the screening:Shoe Carnival, Inc. (SCVL  -  Free Report), which operates as a family footwear retailer, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 12% for 3-5 years. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

(ARW  -  Free Report), which provides products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. The expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is currently 11.8%.Lithia Motors, Inc. (LAD  -  Free Report), which operates automotive franchises, and retails new and used vehicles, has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.9% for 3-5 years. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report), which provides postsecondary education services, has a VGM Score of B. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 14.5% for 3-5 years.Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report), which provides financial management and compliance products and services, has a VGM Score of A.

786,INTU,"U.S. President Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods, while Beijing warned it would retaliate. This has heightened the trade spat between the two of the world’s largest economies. Investors, naturally, have turned nervous as earnings of companies could be at risk in the event of a global trade war.But there are some companies that might benefit. Among these are domestic producers of goods that do limited business in China, and companies with solid growth narratives as their promising outlook remains unfazed by the change in tariffs. Thus, investing in such winners at times of a trade war will not be a bad proposition.Trump Ups the Stake in Trade WarThe chances of a trade clash between Washington and Beijing intensified after Trump instructed the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to figure out $200 billion in imports from China for additional tariffs of 10%. He added that the United States may impose tariffs on another $200 billion provided the Asian nation retaliates.Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports. The tariffs will be passed in two phases. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later.Trump said that “the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world” and that the U.S. “will continue using all available tools to create a better and fairer trading system for all Americans.”The tariffs are intended to force China change its unfair practices with respect to technology and innovation. But regrettably China is hell-bent on increasing its tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. exports (read more: Trade War Fears Grip Wall Street: Buy 5 Ultra-Safe Stocks).Global Fund Managers Turn to AlibabaTrade wars are headwinds for companies as these erode profit margins and affect the overall economy. Thus, this rising tension has compelled top fund managers to look for companies that can emerge as winners. These companies have a strong domestic business and are unperturbed by import tariffs or in other words have a dominant market position.George Maris, a portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund has identified one such company. That is none other than Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report), primarily, because of its domestic exposure.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.7% compared with the Internet - Commerce industry’s estimated rally of 12.3%. The company has also outperformed the industry in the last year (+50.7% compared with +49.1%).Google, Facebook & Axon Enterprise Undeterred by a Trade WarCompanies that have long-term growth narrative will also not be affected by a trade war. Notable, among them are Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report). Google’s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising, since the search engine controls more than 40% of the U.S. digital ad market. Google’s focus on smart home technology, cloud data centers and automated driving drives the company’s earnings. All these areas are unlikely to be affected by a trade war.       Similarly, Facebook’s growth is mostly in digital advertising. Facebook controls 20% of the U.S. digital ad market, while Instagram controls another 5%. Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs.Axon Enterprise sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world. Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover, which gives the stock a solid growth narrative.In fact, shares of Alphabet, Facebook and Axon Enterprise rose 2.1%, 1.3% and 2.7% on Jun 18, respectively despite Trump’s threat to escalate the trade fight with China.Why Thinking Small is Not the Only Thing to Do Now?In the wake of Trump’s tariff announcement, investors seem to be shifting into small-cap stocks. And why so? This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large-caps. But, in reality, the difference isn’t much. Per data from FactSet Research, small-caps stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive 20.6% of their revenues from outside the United States, while stocks from the broader S&P 500 derive 30.3%.Satellite player Harris, electrical equipment maker Hubbell, seller of lighting equipment Acuity Brands, aerospace and defense players KLX and L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report), conglomerate Roper Technologies, Inc.

Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is another company that derives 95% of its sales from the country, Goldman added.

787,INTU,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether or not this provider of payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.77%.What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model shows that Paychex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock fulfils the Zacks criteria of a positive Earnings ESP, and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Paychex has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at 61 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 10.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $854.8 million, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteLet’s now discuss the influencing factors in detail.Factors to ConsiderStrong domain expertise in human capital-management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services are expected to increase the company’s clientele and drive revenues.The company’s product launches and joint-venture initiatives are additional positives. Its investments toward building the sales team, which eventually assists in client addition and revenue generation, is a major tailwind.Notably, during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company’s solutions were adopted by the International Franchise Association (IFA) for providing payroll services for IFA membership.We also believe Paychex’s inorganic growth strategies are also proving conducive to its growth. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, the company has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters.However, a declining client retention rate is affecting the company’s financials. Additionally, heightening competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Insperity, Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report) and DST System is another key concern.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

788,INTU,"Germany-based enterprise application software, SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.03, reflecting a beat of 1%. Overall, SAP has a modest earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.2% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySAP is poised to grow on the back of resilient Cloud and Software business, a strong business network spread over critical client demand areas, superior customer management along with growth of S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives.Over the past few quarters, the company has recorded spectacular growth in S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives, which in turn, has provided a boost to financials. During second-quarter 2017, the company gained 500 customers, of which 30% is entirely new. The company anticipates demand for S/4 HANA to surge, which will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter.SAP’s renewed focus on strengthening IoT foothold is also expected to boost the top line in the quarter under review, as it has resulted in significant client wins. With business enterprises leveraging state-of-the-art technology to outshine peers, we believe that SAP’s market leading portfolio will continue to witness increased demand, thus supplementing its financials.Moreover, SAP has been focusing on expanding cloud business to become one of the leading players in the category. The company has a competitive edge over its cloud competitors as its processes are designed to be industry-specific and can be customized to meet corresponding business requirements. Further, solid adoption of the company’s human capital management (‘HCM’) applications, led by SuccessFactors Employee Central, is expected to drive the results in the upcoming quarter.However, the fact remains that dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections are adversely affecting SAP’s performances. This apart, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances and general economic slowdowns, which adversely impacted purchasing power. Moreover, sluggishness in China might dent the IT spending in the country, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the IT services industry is characterized by stiff competition from technology behemoths, which in turn may also dampen the third-quarter financials. This apart, currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also likely to thwart sales for the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SAP this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.14. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.SAP SE Price and EPS Surprise SAP SE Price and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteZacks Rank:SAP has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #2.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

SuccessFactors Employee Central, which forms the backbone of the company’s Human Capital Management offerings, surpassed the 1,800-customer mark in the second quarter. Driven by solid market traction of cloud business, the company has raised mid-term outlook, signaling brighter days ahead. In the past three months, the company’s stock has yielded a return of 8.2%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 4.7%.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s new class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications — SAP HANA has been its biggest top-line driver ever since its introduction. The company’s latest offering from the SAP HANA family, S/4HANA, has established itself as a “mission critical control center” for businesses pursuing digital transformation. This apart, the company constantly upgrades existing products and launches new ones to expand customer base, which offers a competitive edge over peers.However, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections have adversely affected the company’s performances.

790,INTU,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) recently unveiled QuickBooks Accountant Apps Program for better management of applications by accounting professionals on behalf of their clients.The applications selected for the program are the ones that have been hugely recommended by people related to the accounting domain. Further, these are in sync with QuickBooks Online and per the press release, “support single sign on via QuickBooks Online Accountant”.The company plans to roll out the new program this month and willing to make it available for users across the United States, UK, Canada and Australia pretty soon.Per, Rich Preece, head of the company’s Accountant Segment, Small Business and Self Employed Group, the addition of this program will be extremely beneficial to the professionals related to the accounting field. This will equip the professionals to provide effective recommendations for the selection and implementation of the applications required by their clients.The accounting professionals will have the option of using preferred pricing for the applications which have been selected for the program. Per the press release, “they can also receive one consolidated, itemized bill each month for all the apps they provision through the program.”According to the company, the applications that will be available initially are “Circulus, Expensify, Float, Method: CRM, Excel Transaction Importer, ServiceM8, SOS Inventory and Tsheets by QuickBooks.” Additional applications are expected to be incorporated going ahead.Intuit Gaining on QuickBook Online’s PopularityIn the last reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, this tax-preparation related software maker delivered revenues of $1165 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1156 million and portraying a 15% year-over-year gain.Intuit Inc. Revenue (TTM) Intuit Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Intuit Inc. QuoteThe company’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group witnessed 19% year-over-year growth. This was primarily driven by 51% subscriber growth rate for Quickbooks Online, which brought the count to 2.8 million at the end of the quarter. Hence, we believe Intuit is winning largely on the accelerated adoption of QuickBooks Online.Additionally, the shift in its business model from selling software to cloud-based subscription providing via QuickBooks is a major tailwind in the long term. Per a recent report by Gartner, the cloud based application services (Saas) is expected to generate around $99.7 billion of revenues by 2020 from $58.6 billion in 2017.With its SaaS-based QuickBooks and Online Tax applications, Intuit is well-positioned to make the most of the growth opportunity in the SaaS market.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderIntuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks worth considering the broader technology sector are Paycom Software, Inc.

791,INTU,"The third-quarter earnings season is all set to kick in and investors are in search of estimate-beating stocks. Why so? Because, a positive earnings surprise or a beat matters the most, irrespective of earnings growth. Let’s dig a little deeper.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Seasonal fluctuations also come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.It’s only after significant research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives that Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. If the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find These Likely Winners?Investors tend to look for stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line but might not always succeed. One way of identifying the winners beforehand is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a driver. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. Investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3-5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 10.Here are five out of the 10 stocks:Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report): This specialty retailer is in the top 6% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1.

792,INTU,"Shares of Intuit Inc.’s (INTU  -  Free Report) have been on the rise following its splendid fourth-quarter 2017 results. The indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in its share price and strong fundamentals.Rising Share PriceIntuithas been clocking solid returns on a year-over-year basis and has surged approximately 33.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 29.1%.Earnings DiscussionThe tax-preparation related software maker reported splendid fourth-quarter results, along with providing an overwhelming first-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance. Intuit’s fourth-quarter results not only fared better than our estimates, but also marked a significant year-over-year improvement, primarily owing to better-than-expected growth in QuickBooks Online and ecosystem along with new and improved products.Other Driving FactorsWe are positive about Intuit’s growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.In a move to focus more on its core tax and accounting businesses, Intuit divested three businesses last year, namely Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. We believe that the company’s initiatives have provided it the much needed funds to invest in and focus more on the fast-growing online businesses. The company looks forward to add more recurring revenues within its Consumer Tax and Small Business segments, capitalizing on the ongoing shift toward digital solutions. Notably, the company’s cloud-based accounting software QuickBooks Online subscriber base surged 58% year over year in fiscal 2017 to 2.38 million. Intuit’s efforts to convert itself into a cloud-based tax and accounting solution provider are encouraging.According to a study by non-profit association CompTIA released in September 2016, over 90% of the companies surveyed utilized some form of cloud computing. Of these, only 6% have been using such solutions for five years. In contrast, 23% of the companies have been using such solutions for a period of less than a year. This indicates that the cloud market has huge growth potential. Furthermore, according to Gartner, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) spending is estimated to increase at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2016–2020) of 37%. With its SaaS-based QuickBooks and Online Tax applications, we think that Intuit is well-poised to lead the market.Additionally, the long-term EPS growth rate is currently an impressive 14.6%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.5%.Bottom LineLooking at these catalysts, we believe that Intuit is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Intuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) , NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, NVIDIA and Micron have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 17.1%, 10.3% and 10%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

798,INTU,"Computer accessory company, Logitech International S.A. (LOGI  -  Free Report) is enjoying numerous growth drivers, as was apparent in the company’s recent earnings reports. Logitech has an impressive streak of earnings beats, having trumped expectations for the seventh consecutive quarter.Even for the longer time frame, Logitech's growth has been quite striking. In fiscal 2015, retail growth on a constant-currency basis was 6%, which jumped to 9% in fiscal 2016. Come fiscal 2017, the sales soared 14%.The company’s product portfolio comprises internet video games, keyboards, audio products, interactive gaming devices and 3D controllers.We believe the thriving cloud-based video-conferencing services, strategic product launches and restructuring actions will continue to be growth drivers. Logitech is enjoying an all-pervasive growth of its retail business, which is likely to continue, going forward. In order to further boost growth, the company is pursuing innovation and expanding its product lines to tap the high potential market for accessories.Logitech has been able to leverage its software and go-to-market capabilities in a bid to drive market share gains. The company has manufactured innovative options, such as the fastest performing mouse and keyboard switches, as well as a wireless mouse with the longest battery life.A diverse product roster and excellent demand enables Logitech to be highly confident on its future financial outlook.Backed by its impressive growth drivers, the company’s stock has had an impressive run on the bourse over the past one year, having appreciated 70.5% — miles ahead of the industry’s average gain of 25.5%.The company’s most significant growth driver — gaming — now constitutes 15% of revenues.

Continuous innovations andthe recent buyout of high-end headset maker ASTRO Gaming make Logitech the leader in a growing space.Growth of Mobile Speaker segment will also likely continue on the back of impressive market traction of Ultimate Ears and Wonderboom product lines. Video Collaboration also grew 49% in the fiscal first quarter, on the back of double-digit increase from all three regions. Rising demand from companies, both large and small, for video-enabling huddle rooms and conference rooms drove sales growth of this segment. Home Control category sales also increased 47%, driven by consistent demand for smart home products.Buoyed by the impressive results and incorporating the accretive impact of the Astro Gaming buyout, Logitech raised its full-year 2018 guidance.

799,INTU,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.9%.The company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.2%. QuickBooks Online ecosystem and TurboTax are likely to aid the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line performance. However, high costs and expenses remain a major concern.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Intuit is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intuit carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.24%.Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.84 billion, up 11.9% year over year and earnings are projected at $4.67 per share, up 19.7% on year over year basis.Factors at PlayThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income tax preparation products and services. Notably, the company has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the last several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its enriched product portfolio, Intuit will have capitalized on this opportunity which we believe will be well reflected in third-quarter results.For the fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base to be in the range of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal third quarter with a subscriber base of 3.144 million, marking year-over-year improvement of 41.6%.The year-over-year increase in the online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.Going ahead, we expect the company’s Consumer Tax segment revenues to continue to benefit from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.The company’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The analysts covering the stock expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, consequently bolstering the overall top-line performance. Furthermore, the company’s TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion its bottom-line results.Nonetheless, Intuit’s high costs and expenses remain a major concern. During the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call, the company had hinted that it would increase investments in engineering and marketing to seize the growing opportunity globally. Notably, Intuit’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 10 basis points year over year. This makes us slightly cautious about the to-be-reported quarter’s bottom-line results.Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intuit Inc. QuoteOther Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NetApp, Inc.

800,INTU,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 47.8% in the last reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard has a decent surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice, while missing the same in one occasion. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 11.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hewlett Packard currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings remained unchanged, over the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings per share to increase 6% to 31 cents from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 25 cents. However, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to be down 26% year over year to $7.33 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe year-over-year decline in revenues is expected mainly because Hewlett Packard is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which, we believe, will continue to hurt its revenues in short term.Furthermore, the acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) was EMC’s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, is providing Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen the company’s relationships with customers of all sizes.This apart, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during fourth-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as the company “continues to capitalize on expanded opportunities from its merger with EMC.”Nonetheless, the company’s bottom-line results are likely to benefit from the spin-off of its low-margin businesses like Software and Enterprise Services. In addition, massive share buybacks over the past year are expected to have boosted Hewlett Packard’s fiscal second-quarter earnings per share.Notably, during fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard returned $3 billion to its shareholders, of which $2.56 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. Continuing the same, the company, during the last reported quarter, returned $862 million to shareholders, of which $742 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are couple of stocks, which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.00% and sports a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuit Inc.

801,INTU,"Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on May 17.In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.28%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive.

Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio that grew significantly in the last reported quarter. The Applied Global Services (AGS) segment increased 5.9% sequentially and 30.2% year over year. The segment is expected to perform well in the quarter to be reported, driven by improved device and yield performance. The ZacksConsensus Estimate for the second quarter for AGS is pegged at $890 million.Strength in Display to Drive RevenuesThe company has gained considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies such as OLED are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of the traditional LCD. In the last reported quarter, the Display segment was down 32.8% from fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 but up 7.8% from the year-ago level. The segment is expected to be driven by significant opportunities coming from investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality and smart vehicles. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter for the Display segment is pegged at $579 million.However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns that could affect the results in the fiscal second quarter.Applied Materials, Inc.

802,INTU,"There is no mystery behind investors’ hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential ahead of an earnings season. This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Also, seasonal fluctuations can come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true. One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 14.Here are five out of the 14 stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report):  This is a manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $588 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $455 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 17% year over year to $393.4 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base and worksite employees, elevated revenues from retirement, as well as online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 37% on a year-over-year basis to $18.1 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex’s total expenses flared up 17% from the year-ago quarter to $574 million due to increased compensation, one-time bonus to non-management employees and a one-time expense related to termination of certain license agreements. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 470 basis points (bps) to 66.2%.The company’s operating income declined 5% year over year to $292.5 million. In addition, Paychex’s operating margin contracted 470 bps to 33.8%, chiefly due to higher total expenses as a percentage of revenues.Net income came in at $260.4 million, up from $202.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Paychex, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.36 billion.Payroll Services Revenues are anticipated to increase 2%. Previously, growth between 1% and 2% was anticipated.Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 13-14% compared with the earlier forecast of 12-14% growth.Interest on funds held for clients is expected to grow in the range of 20% to 25%, up from the previous projection of mid-to-upper-teen range.Operating margin is anticipated to be 38%, down from earlier range of 39-40%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.45.Our TakePaychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth boost our optimism. We also believe the company’s expansion initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, will likely support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Also, Paychex’s focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. For the third quarter, the company did not mention anything about client growth for its payroll services.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report), Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Additionally, the incorporation of a virtual voice assistant in the platform is another tailwind.The company completed three acquisitions during the second quarter, of which the most prominent one is “TSheets” that added a time tracking application to the platform. The enrichment of the employee base via these additions is also a positive. The company’s brand awareness related programs are proving to be beneficial as well, as quoted by management. Notably, revenues from Consumer Group were up 12% year over year. Professional tax revenues within Strategic Partners Group were $95 million.The company’s recent enhancements to products generating revenues for the Consumer Group are proving to be worthy. The inclusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning has enriched the platform by improving consumer experience.The introduction of TurboTax Live has created growth opportunities for the company in the assisted market.

805,INTU,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) recently revealed that deployment of SAP Hybris Marketing Cloud solution has empowered businesses to gain deeper insight into customers, resulting in higher return on investment. Per the June 2017 commissioned study, conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of SAP Hybris, use of SAP Hybris Marketing Cloud has helped enterprises achieve net-new revenue increase by an average of $10.1 million over three years and ROI increase 306%.Deployment of SAP Hybris Marketing Cloud aids in engagement with customers across channels and devices as well as consolidate those insights into a single view, thus enabling companies to deliver personalized and relevant messages along with launching marketing campaigns. Per the study, the solution helps in improving e-mail conversion by 40%, increasing average order value (AOV) by 5%, boosting reporting functions and dashboards, consolidate disparate marketing systems as well as reducing integration costs.However, SAP’s performances have been negatively affected by the dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections. Consequently, the company’s stock has yielded a return of 3.2% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s increase of 6.4%.Moreover, the company’s business is global in nature, which exposes it to political, economical as well as regulatory risks. Over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced widespread economic slowdowns, which adversely impacted purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also adding to the woes. Further, the industry in which the company operates is highly competitive, which can hurt margins and erode market share. However, it seems that the resiliency of its Cloud and Software business, presence of a large business network and strategic partnerships could help this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company overcome the headwinds and achieve sustainable growth.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Dassault Systemes SA (DASTY  -  Free Report), Xplore Technologies Corp (XPLR  -  Free Report) and Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report). While Dassault Systemes and Xplore Technologies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Intuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

806,INTU,"The technology sector continues to attract investors due to its dynamic nature. It is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.The technology sector has been a prolific performer on a year-to-date basis with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) registering a return of 22.8% year to date. The positive data suggests that the sector will grow further in 2017. According to a recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT), global IT spending for 2017 will rise 2.4%, up from 0.3% in 2016.Per the research firm, the worldwide public cloud services market is anticipated to increase 18% in 2017 to $246.8 billion, up from $209.2 billion in 2016. It also forecasted that the number of connected things will increase 31% to 8.4 billion in 2017 from 6.4 billion in 2016.So, we believe that this is the right time to invest in this space. However, picking the right stocks is always a tough task. To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further, we have opted for one tried and tested technique – picking stocks near their 52-week highs.Making the Right ChoiceThe 52-week investment strategy loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing and is one of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook. The basic idea is “buy high and sell higher” since once a trend is established, it is likely to continue. In other words, stocks that are growing will continue to grow.The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales, robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects.  Major developments may also send stocks soaring. On the flipside, stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued. But the positives seem to outweigh the drawbacks.Still, to be on the safer side, why not bet on stocks that besides trading near their 52-week highs and have a positive earnings history. The stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Momentum Score of A or B. Notably, back-tested results show that this favorable combination handily outperforms other stocks.5 Stocks to Scoop Up Entegris, Inc.

SAP’s Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions experienced double-digit growth in cloud bookings and software revenues over the last quarter.Improvement in SAP Hybris cloud solutions for the front office across sales, service, commerce, marketing, and revenue resulted in 40% rise in deals involving multiple SAP Hybris cloud solutions during the first half of 2017, compared with the year-ago period.Recently, the company also entered in to a global reseller agreement with ClickSoftware.

808,INTU,"Not only is September historically the worst month for the equity market, stocks presently look susceptible to a pullback due to Harvey, North Korea tensions and U.S. government shutdown. However, fresh data have indicated that the domestic economy continues to grow at a steady albeit slow pace. Corporate earnings also continue to impress and from a trading perspective, more market participants are expected this month as vacation time comes to an end.Thanks to these encouraging developments, Wall Street is expected to be more disciplined and prepared to withstand the habitually rough trading period. Thus, investing in solid stocks that have given consistent returns this month will be judicious. The Somber September  Investors shouldn’t sell based solely on the calendar, but, this seasonal peculiarity can’t be ignored as we head into a busy month of trading. Since the World War II, the S&P 500 Index has seen losses in September. Also, September has seen the worst monthly drop in equities on average.Stock Trader’s Almanac found out that since 1950, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones averaged a loss of 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%, as did the Russell 2000 of small-cap stocks since it was started in 1979. Such a dismal performance compelled Jeff deGraaf, head of Renaissance Macro Research, to tell his clients that we are “entering the only month of the year that has statistically significant negative returns.”This year could also spring surprises. With North Korea attacking Japan, hurricane Harvey wreaking havoc and the political climate in the United States losing stability, possibilities of a market correction haunt investors.Market-Jolting Events that Spooked Investors North Korea’s ballistic missile launch over Japanese airspace reignited tensions. This has resumed the logjam between Pyongyang and President Trump that had unnerved markets in August. The South Korea military that was conducting a war game with the United States has been put on alert, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile test an “unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.”On the domestic front, Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, has put vast areas under water. The rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions. The hurricane disrupted oil refineries and led to a decline in shares of insurance companies (read more: 4 Home-Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey Mayhem). As if all of that wasn’t enough, anxiety gripping the Wall Street over the debate to raise the federal government’s debt ceiling has frayed relations between President Trump and the Republican leadership. Such disputes, may, further delay the implementation of the promised pro-business policies. In fact, with the disconnect growing, the chances that the government will shut down is 50/50, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report).Positive Economic Environment & Earnings Buoy MarketsBut, let’s be optimistic. Not everything is as dampening about the markets. The U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest rate of growth in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment helped the economy gain traction. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.The second-quarter earnings season, in the meanwhile, has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 491 S&P 500 members or 98.2% of the index’s total membership already out. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.2% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% beating revenue estimates (read more: Plenty of Small-Cap Earnings Still to Come).Investors Will be Back, Market to See Some UpsideWith the Labor Day fast approaching, the summer months and vacations are soon to be over. During such holiday periods, major market participants don’t make big moves. Big decisions are often postponed. But, once the summer months come to an end and the markets get back to normal, the major decisions are taken.This suggests that trade will increase and market leaders will return and take control of the equity market in a commanding manner. Furthermore, typically after Labor Day, the market is slow for a day or two before things pick up pace.5 Top-Performing Stocks for SeptemberSeptember may be a rocky month for the stock market. But, as mentioned above, there are positives that may propel the broader markets. We have, thus, selected five stocks that have not only gained, traditionally during the rough trading month of September but also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here’s a closer look at them:Company NameAverage Return(Historic)Median Return(Historic)Percentage of Positive ReturnsRegeneron Pharmaceuticals4.33%2.02%58%Activision Blizzard4.24%6.72%65%Intuit4.42%3.06%71%Alexion Pharmaceuticals5.72%6.17%77%Gilead Sciences4.71%4.31%68%Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions.

812,INTU,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) recently announced that Saratoga Hospital has successfully improved patient safety and clinical outcomes by integrating Philips IntelliVue Guardian with automated Early Warning Scoring (EWS) system. IntelliVue Guardian solution provides better insights to clinicians and helps them to take better decisions, thus improving patient outcomes along with enhancing workflow.Leveraging Saratoga Hospital’s modified early warning score (MEWS) algorithm, the IntelliVue Guardian Solution enables clinicians to discover deviations in a patient's vital signs. The solution also incorporates an automated respiration rate into its EWS calculations that improves quality and accuracy. The implementation of Philips’ patient monitoring technology has enabled Saratoga Hospital to reduce patient transfers to the intensive care unit (ICU) as well as eliminate patient codes within its 20-bed orthopedic unit.Our TakePhilips is gradually evolving as a healthcare company, having grown its presence in the domain over the past couple of quarters. Also, the Healthcare Informatics Solutions & Services margins are improving constantly as the company is transforming this business from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business.In addition, Philips remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical owing to positive industry trends as Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 2% against the industry’s loss of 1.3%.Moreover, the company is focusing on key opportunities in population health management. This apart, Philips is improving its enterprise wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations to enhance its stronghold in the healthcare industry. Meanwhile, the company’s eye on strategic acquisitions and alliances has bolstered its core business. For instance, the buyout of health technology behemoth — CardioProlific — has strengthened the company’s pipeline of catheter-based therapy devices. Along with CardioProlific, Spectranetics and TomTec are also likely to be conducive to Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio.However, Philips’ near-term profitability is expected to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. Also, the company’s diverse international presence exposes it to macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tension. Furthermore, currency headwinds have hurt its financials over the past few quarters and might continue doing so in the quarters ahead.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc.

816,INTU,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, manufactures, sales and services commercial jetliners, military aircraft, has a VGM Score of A. This Zacks Rank #1 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 13.8% for 3-5 years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lithia Motors, Inc.

817,INTU,"Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 28.6%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 24.4% and a market cap of $6.33 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to retain in their portfolio if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Notably, the Paycom stock has gained 25% in the year so far, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18.7%.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Paycom is a provider of cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software as a service solution for integrated software for employee records and talent management processes. The company offers analytics which manage the complete employment life cycle, right from recruitment to retirement.The company is gaining from its regular investments in SaaS technology. Over the last few years, clients migrating from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services have contributed significantly to its revenues. Notably, more and more organizations are becoming aware of the benefits of new age human resource technologies, which will continue to positively impact their financials.We believe accelerated adoption of Paycom’s robust portfolio has aided the company’s financials. In first-quarter 2018, the company’s revenues came in at $153.9 million, reflecting a 29% year-over-year increase, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million.Furthermore, the company’s client base has been growing, supported by its sales force. In the last reported quarter, management was particularly optimistic about the operations of the company’s sales force, with senior sales people outperforming expectations. Pertaining to the stellar performance of the sales team, the company opened its 47th sales office in Rochester, NY, in the first quarter of 2018.Nevertheless, heightening competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report), Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) and Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) remains a headwind, which could lead to pricing pressure and affect Paycom’s margins.Paycom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

818,INTU,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move, with the stock up 8.8% over the past month. INTU hit a new 52-week-high of $213.76 in the previous session. Intuit has gained 35.3% since the start of the year compared to the 9.3% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 17.4% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 22, 2018, Intuit reported EPS of $4.82 vs.the Zacks Consensus of $4.67 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.91%.For the current fiscal year, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $5.53 per share on $5.93 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.4% change in EPS on a 14.51% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.52 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 17.96% and 9.88%, respectively.Valuation MetricsIntuit may be at a 52-week-high right now, but what might the future hold for INTU? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Intuit has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 38.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 44.9X versus its peer group's average of 25.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.38. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Intuit passes the test. Thus, it seems as though INTU shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Intuit have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report), SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report), and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Computer-Software industry is in the top 29% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for INTU, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

820,INTU,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

821,INTU,"Shares of Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report), a business and financial software company, have been performing well of late.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 14.1%.Estimates NorthboundEstimates for Intuithave moved up in the last 30 days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts. The earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 and 2019 have gone up in the last 30 days.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has gone up by 1 cent in the last 30 days and is pegged at $4.97. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 also moved north by 3 cents to $5.58.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryIntuit outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an encouraging positive average earnings surprise of 37.5%.Ahead of the IndustryIntuit stock has gained 32.1% year over year, outperforming 31.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Upbeat Q1Intuit delivered stellar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company reported non-GAAP income (excluding stock-based compensation, amortization and other one-time items) from continuing operations of 11 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents.This tax-preparation related software maker reported revenues of $886 million, which came ahead of management’s guided range of $840-$860 million and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $855 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 13.9% primarily owing to better-than-expected growth in QuickBooks Online and ecosystem along with new and improved products.Strong GuidanceFor the second quarter, the company anticipates revenues in a range of $1.160-$1.180 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.12 billion. The company anticipates reporting non-GAAP earnings in the band of 31-34 cents per share.

Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.The company has also restructured business to focus on the QuickBooks services. It expects to continue investing in this portfolio, which might hurt near-term profitability.However, stiff competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit’s tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

822,INTU,"Shares of Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) rose more than 2% yesterday, after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results.The company’s non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 29 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Also, reported earnings increased from 15 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Further, shares of Paycom Software have surged a whopping 88.1% in the past one year, outperforming the industry‘s increase of just 23.1%.Quarter DetailsPaycom Software reported revenues of $101.3 million, which increased 30.9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $100 million. The year-over-over increase can be attributedto the addition of new clients, new business wins and product development initiatives.Moreover, revenues were impacted positively by 31.2% increase in recurring revenues and approximately 21.9% increase in implementation and other revenues on a year-over-year basis.The company’s adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 84%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Paycom Software’s adjusted EBITDA increased 69% year over year to $30.7 million. Adjusted operating margins during the quarter came in 30.3% as compared with 23.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, total administration expenses decreased to 58.5% during the quarter from 63.5% reported in the year-ago period.Non-GAAP net income came in at $16.9 million compared with $8.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowPaycom Software exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $66.6 million compared with $68.1 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.4 million as compared with $1.8 million reported in the previous quarter.The company’s balance sheet comprises long-term debt of $33.2 million compared with $33.5 million reported in the previous quarter. It reported cash flow from operations of $92.4 million during nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.During the quarter, Paycom Software repurchased stocks worth $50 million. Moreover, the company authorized an additional share repurchase program, increasing the amount to $75 million.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Paycom Software expects revenues in a range of $111.5-$113.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $113.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately in the range of $26-$28 million.Paycom Software updated fiscal 2017 guidance.

Adjusted EBITDA is now anticipated to be approximately in a range of $131-$133 million (previously $122.5-$124.5 million).Our TakePaycom Software reported stellar third-quarter 2016 results and provided modest fourth-quarter guidance. The company also updated fiscal 2017 revenue guidance. Also, both the top line and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software’s Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind in the long run. Further, the company might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues, going forward.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report), Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) and Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) remains a headwind.Currently, Paycom Software carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

823,INTU,"Shares of Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $210.85 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging fourth-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.5% since it reported fiscal third-quarter results on May 22. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Intuit has rallied 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17%.The company’s results in the last reported quarter benefited from a number of reasons. Management was particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return. The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market. Additionally, the shift in its product mix toward the higher end of the company’s product line was also a positive.Intuit has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.8%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal.Factors Driving Intuit’s Robust Quarterly PerformancesThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income-tax preparation products and services. Notably, Intuit has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the past several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base, which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity which is well reflected in its previous quarterly results.For fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal fourth quarter with a subscriber base of 3.223 million, marking 45.2% year-over-year improvement.The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues, going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.The company’s Consumer Tax segment revenue has been benefiting from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.Intuit’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The company, during the last earnings conference call, stated that its TurboTax Live offering witnessed success in the first season and is likely to be accretive to the company’s Consumer business, moving ahead.The recently-launched Turbo offering that provides a snapshot of a user’s financial health also witnessed healthy adoption, which is yet another catalyst for expansion of the company’s business beyond tax.Furthermore, its TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion Intuit’s bottom-line results.A Buy Rated StockIntuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and flaunts a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.Some Other Stocks Worth ConsideringSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

824,INTU,"Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) specialized group of engineers known as MERIT —Major Emergency Response Incident Team — recently finished their annual training to ensure the protection of the company’s network assets and facilities in the event of natural disasters or hazardous materials incidents. Formed in 1992, Verizon’s MERIT team consists of more than 30 technically skilled communications employees. These members are certified and capable of entering into an area hit by hazardous materials spill and responsible for completing network repairs.In fact, the MERIT team is known to have a wide range of expertise in areas such as wireless and wireline telecommunications network equipment like fiber optic cables, routers, transmission equipment, customer premise equipment, wireless mobile assets, radio networks and critical infrastructure like Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Trained in emergency response management, this team of specialized engineers are also capable of operating at the highest operational protection level. The use of multiple tools enables them to detect over 30 chemicals, biological as well as radiological containments.Notably, the team’s training has been completed under the guidelines of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”). Verizon’s MERIT team is equipped with an onsite, climate-controlled mobile command center with a conference room, workspaces, external cameras, communications equipment, an on-board generator as well as a weather station.Our TakeVerizon expects its Wireless and Wireline businesses to perform impressively in 2018. Solid margin expansion owing to expected savings from tax reform and continued strong FiOS fiber-optic network and strategic services in the Wireline business is also anticipated in the same period. Further, the company is looking forward to capitalize on the countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things and telematics ecosystem across multiple industries. Verizon’s focus on online content delivery, mobile video and online advertising is likely to drive growth as well.In the past three months, shares of Verizon have lost 0.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.3%.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is systematically diversifying itself as a major player in the digital content and online advertising space.  Also, the company has been forging ahead to expand its fiber optics networks to support 4G LTE and upcoming 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections. Verizon too has an attractive fundamental outlook based on increasingly favorable growth prospects for its Wireless business and the possibility of improved performance from its Wireline operations.However, Verizon continues to struggle in the competitive and almost-saturated U.S. wireless market. The industry is likely to witness more competition in 2018, with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). Furthermore, in an effort to expand its customer base, the company is spending heavily on promotion and offering lucrative discounts, which might weigh on margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include AMETEK, Inc.

826,INTU,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10.2% over the past month. INTU hit a new 52-week high of $210.13 in the previous session. Intuit has gained 32.5% since the start of the year compared to the 9.8% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 18.3% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 22, 2018, Intuit reported EPS of $4.82 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.67 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.91%.For the current fiscal year, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $5.53 per share on $5.93 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.4% change in EPS on a 14.51% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.52 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 17.96% and 9.88%, respectively.Valuation MetricsIntuit may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for INTU? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Intuit has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 37.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 44X versus its peer group's average of 25.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.33. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuit Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Intuit passes the test. Thus, it seems as though INTU shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Intuit have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (SPNS  -  Free Report), Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report), and Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 19% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for INTU, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

829,INTU,"Rising yields have somewhat dulled the appeal for dividend investing. Yet, stocks that consistently pay higher dividend are in vogue, as these tend to be high in quality and offer strong growth potential even in volatile patches.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 10 stocks that fit the bill:Owens Corning Inc. (OC  -  Free Report): This Ohio-based company is a world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions. It is expected to see earnings growth of 17.96% this year and has a P/E ratio of 18.28 versus the industry average of 19.28. Owens Corning has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Style Score of B.

Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software’s Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind in the long run. Further, Paycom Software might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues, going forward.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report), Intuit Inc.

Earnings and revenues also recorded year-over-year improvement.Intuit’s revenues of $2.925 billion jumped 15% year over year and non-GAAP earnings of $4.82 per share marked increased 24%.

839,INTU,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Shoe Carnival, Inc. (SCVL  -  Free Report), which operates as a family footwear retailer, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 12% for 3-5 years. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Segments that were once relatively untouched by the recent revolutions that we have seen in the world of computing, communications, and information are now finally being revamped with high tech processes.Two such major shifts as of late in the market come to us in the world of FinTech—which blends technology and finance into new types of banking, card processing, and the like—and also the Internet of Things, a wide market that touches everything from household products to industrial machinery by connecting a variety of devices to the internet so that they can send and receive data or instructions.Both FinTech and the Internet of Things look to be high growth areas and could completely change their respective industries in the near future too. And with this kind of growth potential, investors have to be asking what are the key points to know about these impressive industries?Well, for some insights on these new areas of the tech world, I spoke to Jay Jacobs, the VP, Director of Research at Global X for this week’s Dutram Report. We discussed these two markets in greater detail, and what investors need to be aware of in both of these increasingly in-focus corners of the stock and ETF world.FinTechFirst up, we discussed the topic of ‘FinTech’, arguably the less famous of the two areas, though it is certainly an important market in its own right. Jay clues us in on the growth that is being seen in this market as of late, and what the key industries are for the near future.We also talk about the Global X FinTech Thematic ETF (FINX  -  Free Report) and how investors can obtain broad exposure to this market via the fund. The product goes beyond usual suspects like PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and we discuss some of the other components here such as Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report) or those in the banking and asset management side, and how they fit into the overall theme.Jay also talks about what kinds of companies—from a cap perspective—are generally included in the fund, and what the most built-up areas of the FinTech ecosystem are right now. Check out the podcast for additional insights though!Internet of ThingsAfter that, we discuss one of my favorite topics in the new-tech world, and that is the Internet of Things. I am a huge fan of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entrant in this space, the Echo, but Jay explains how the market goes well beyond this consumer product and hits a variety of areas.One such segment that could be a huge beneficiary of the soaring demand for internet-connected devices is the semiconductor space.
