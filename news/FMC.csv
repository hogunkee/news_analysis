1,FMC,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite all fell last week and are selling off sharply Monday. That has hit a number of top stocks. But the stock market action also has helped a number of notable stocks form handles and new buy points. Tesla (TSLA) stock formed a handle Monday with a new, lower entry. Home Depot (HD) stock and Arista Networks (ANET) stock just forged handles last week, but Arista tumbled Monday. FMC (FMC) stock has had a handle for weeks.XA handle occurs in the upper half of a consolidation. The stock price should be flat to downward sloping, ideally on light and declining volume. It should be a minimum of five days but can be for several weeks.Simply put, a handle helps shake out weak holders just before a stock is ready to break out. That way, when a stock surges higher in strong volume, everyone who owns a position is happy. Mutual funds and other big institutions seeking to add shares must bid up the price to do so.Shares faced resistance around 360 several times in a consolidation going back to last September. Tesla stock broke through decisively on Monday, hitting a nine-month high of 373.73. But then it tumbled to 333.63 by Friday, down 4% that day and nearly 7% for the week. If Tesla stock stays in its current pattern through Monday, it'll have a proper handle and a 373.83 buy point.Tesla stock fell 0.2% to 333.01 on Monday, faring far better than the S&P 500 and especially the Nasdaq.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is off its March lows but hasn't made much progress since the end of October. Tesla's RS line is well below its June 23 peak.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTesla stock's recent run came as Elon Musk said it was ""very likely"" that Model 3 production would finally hit 5,000 a week by the end of June, a critical step as Tesla runs low on cash. He also expected the electric vehicle maker to turn a profit in Q3.The company will release Q2 production and delivery figures in the first week of July. It's unclear if it'll provide any specifics about end-of-June output. Still, if Tesla breaks out soon, it's akin to a stock moving into buy range just before earnings, with the potential for big price gains or losses So potential investors may want to consider an earnings option strategy.The Dow Jones home improvement giant has now formed a handle in its cup base, giving it a 201.70 buy point. Home Depot stock fell 1.45% to 197.41 on Friday. The RS line is just below a new high even though Home Depot stock still has a ways to go before hitting the Jan. 26 peak of 207.60.Home Depot dipped 0.5% to 196.38 Monday.As of Friday, the networking firm had formed a 287.10 handle in a consolidation going back to mid-February. But on Monday, Arista stock fell 4.7% to 259.87, below its 50-day line. Worse, midpoint of the handle is now below the midpoint of the base. That means it's no longer a proper handle, invalidating the 287.10 entry. The buy point, for now, goes back to 311.77, just above the top of the base.Arista went on a powerful run in 2017, with tight consolidations along the way. In 2018, its consolidations have been somewhat messy, which is less promising. That may reflect the overall choppy market, but that in itself has made breakouts more prone to failure and shakeouts.The chemicals maker has been basing for nearly six months, with its handle forming since late May. FMC stock has a 93.05 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares found support in the handle at the 50-day. FMC stock rose 2.7% to 88.94 on Friday, rebounding from the 50-day line and reclaiming the 200-day line.FMC sank 0.6% to 88.40 Monday.One big negative is FMC's RS line. It's been slumping since October and is well below where it was in early January at the left side of the consolidation.Investors should generally look for stocks that are truly leading the market. At the very least, investors should look for a powerful FMC breakout that pushes the RS line above the high of its handle.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These Five 99 Composite Rating Stocks Are In, Near Buy ZonesIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisThe Big Picture: Is The Selling In Leading Growth Stocks An Ominous Sign?How To Trade Stocks: Spot Traits Of Proper Handles In Good BasesThree Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep Tumbling

9,FMC,"Tesla (TSLA) may partner with Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) to produce a key component of batteries for the struggling Model 3 and other electric vehicles.X Elon Musk's company is in talks with SQM, a fertilizer giant that is also Chile's largest lithium producer, to build a factory that will process lithium, according to a Financial Times report Monday. A deal would mark Tesla's first foray into securing a raw material whose prices have soared as electric vehicles gain popularity, it added.Global automakers are battling to secure supplies of lithium in order to meet ambitious goals for electric vehicles. In October, General Motors (GM) announced plans for 20 new all-electric models by 2023. Recently, Ford Motor (F) more than doubled its planned investments in electric vehicles to $11 billion by 2022, targeting 40 hybrid and all-electric vehicles in the lineup.Toyota Motor (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) also plan aggressive expansions of their electric-vehicle lineups. Toyota Motor is said to be investing in Australian company Orocobre, which produces lithium in Argentina.The electrification push comes as countries across the world crack down on cars that emit pollutants and seek to reduce dependence on foreign oil.While the talks between Tesla and SQM are at an early stage, Tesla could invest in technology to produce lithium hydroxide, used in car batteries, directly from the salt beneath Chile's desert, the Times said. SQM recently struck a deal with Chilean authorities to boost lithium production at a massive salt flat, ending a years-long dispute over the Salar de Atacama, one of the world's largest lithium reserves. That deal raised concerns that higher lithium supply could hit prices, sending shares of lithium plays plunging.Shares of Tesla rose about 2% to 349.53 on the stock market today.

10,FMC,"Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), or SQM, can now expand its production at one of the biggest sources of lithium, thanks to an agreement announced late Wednesday with a Chilean economic development agency. But the potential broadening of supply — which comes as automakers focus more on electric vehicles with lithium batteries — hit SQM and especially other lithium plays Thursday.X The agreement with the agency, Corfo, ends a years-long spat over SQM's royalties related to that location, Salar de Atacama, a massive salt flat in Chile that also holds some of the world's largest supplies of lithium. The government alleged that SQM had been underpaying royalties connected to its lease on that location, and said the company had run afoul of environmental rules, according to Reuters.Under terms of the deal, SQM, among other things, would have to make higher lease and royalty payments, take steps to improve its corporate governance and environmental-control measures and put money toward research and development in areas close to that land.The company will also have to offer part of its lithium production ""at a preferential price"" to some producers that may eventually work in Chile.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile is a fertilizer giant, but it's one of several stocks seen as a lithium play amid strong demand and prices.SQM fell dipped 0.9% to 59.02 in the stock market today after tumbling intraday to 56.51 undercutting its 50-day line. Shares have sold off since closing Friday at 63.90.Other lithium plays were harder hit. Albermale (ALB), the world's largest producer of lithium, plunged 7.1% to 117.91, though off session lows of 112.54. Albermale crashed through its 200-day moving average, the first time it's undercut that key level in nearly two years. FMC Corp.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.SQM's deal comes as automakers like Ford (F) plow more money into electric vehicles, whose batteries are composed partly of lithium.

11,FMC,"Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) and other lithium-related stocks traded lower Tuesday as the Chilean lithium miner gears for an arbitration hearing tied to a key lithium lease.X SQM has run into conflict with Chile's state-run development agency Corfo over royalty payments tied to its lease of a site holding some of the world's most productive lithium deposits. Talks between the two sides failed in October, Reuters reported at the time, with Corfo insisting that SQM end its lease early and return the site to the state.But Reuters reported over the weekend that the Chilean government has given Corfo the go ahead to reach a deal with SQM when the two sides meet for a scheduled arbitration hearing on Wednesday. SQM and Corfo will agree to resolve their arbitration, Reuters reportedly indicated, and SQM will be allowed to produce up to 180,000 metric tons of lithium annually, which would more than triple current production of around 50,000 metric tons.Morningstar equity analyst Seth Goldstein wrote Tuesday:""Our lithium supply-and-demand model had assumed SQM would produce slightly more than 100,000 metric tons of lithium by 2025. Given the possibility of 80,000 metric tons per year of new supply that we had not previously accounted for — equivalent to roughly 10% of our 2025 demand forecast — we are placing lithium producers SQM, Albemarle and FMC under review. We will revisit our long-term lithium forecast once the results of the arbitration hearing are final.""Our forecast had assumed a midcycle lithium price of around $10,000 per metric ton, which is the price we believed necessary to incentivize higher cost supply in order to meet 2025 demand. If SQM ramps up lithium production to 180,000 metric tons by 2025 and the majority of announced projects under development come online, then the incentive price needed for supply to meet our 2025 demand forecast of 775,000 metric tons could fall.""In another lithium supply move, Toyota Motor (TM) will invest $232 million to take a 15% stake in Australian lithium producer Orocobre, news reports said Tuesday. Toyota, like other automakers, aims to secure lithium supplies as they accelerate plans for electric vehicles.But the prospect of higher lithium supplies pressuring prices hit many lithium-related stocks.IBD'S TAKE: As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Lithium-related stocks and ETFs have been seen as a way to play the boom in electric vehicles and electronic devices using lithium batteries. The main driver of rising global lithium demand is momentum for electric vehicles. Battery costs are coming down, even as countries from Norway to China and India are looking to ban traditional fossil-fuel engines and to reduce reliance on foreign oil.The Global X Lithium and Battery ETF invests in the full lithium cycle, from companies involved in mining and refining the metal to producing batteries for cars and electronic devices.Toyota added 0.5% to 137.52 Tuesday after making a fresh intraday high of 139.50.At the ongoing Detroit auto show, Ford Motor (F) said it will increase its investments in electric vehicles to $11 billion by 2022, boosting its low-emission lineup to 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles worldwide. But the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reportedly said EVs don't make money, suggesting they are an overhyped investment.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Tech Stocks Are Near Buys With Strong RS LinesStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Find The Best Stocks Before They Break Out

15,FMC,"From high-efficiency AA batteries to the powerplants of electric cars, lithium has emerged as a critical mineral and source of energy — a trend that has given Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT) big gains in 2017.X The exchange traded fund does not track the price of lithium, but rather the main players in the industry, from producers of the mineral to large users such as electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) and No. 1 smartphone maker Samsung.In a portfolio of 35 companies, the largest holdings are Albemarle (ALB) and FMC Corp. (FMC), two U.S.-based lithium producers. Albemarle accounts for 18% of the portfolio and FMC 17%.

Assets have increased to more than $1 billion, a respectable sum for a specialty ETF.Emerging technologies can make for volatile investments, and Tesla's up-and-down 2017 illustrates that. Overall, analysts expect continued expansion for lithium power. Demand for lithium started rising with the growth of portable electronics. That part of the market is expected to level off. But as a report from Global X notes, ""the new x-factor for lithium demand growth is electric vehicles, and to a lesser extent, utility scale energy storage for renewables like wind and solar.""In China, battery electric vehicle sales soared 96% in October from the year-ago period, and for the first 10 months of the year Chinese electric vehicle sales were tracking 45% ahead of the year-ago period, according to a research note from Nomura Instinet on Nov. 21.

24,FMC,"When you talk stocks with other investors, there are the companies that get nods from everyone with their recognizable names — from the hottest IPO to the maker of a trendy consumer product to the latest technology heavyweight. But there are also names off the beaten path that may elicit a questioning glance. Those lower-profile companies offer plenty of opportunities.Technical action is weighted more heavily in swing trading, although it's not limited to an individual stock's performance. The broad market's action clearly has a huge influence on a trade.Industry groups also can wield significant influence. That especially has been true as groups have fallen in and out of favor based on policy decisions of the Trump administration, as well as the likelihood of their successful implementation. These group movements need to be watched closely to reveal potential prospects.Huntsman (HUN) isn't a name most folks would recognize, even if they might use their products. You find the company's polyurethane products in insulation, automotive interiors, and even in your shoes. A big factor for the company's entry on IBD's SwingTrader was group strength. Its Basic Chemicals group was showing movement — and Huntsman was a top stock of the group based on relative strength. FMC Corp. (FMC) was another group member in contention, but Huntsman started moving first with accompanying volume.The stock was added March 28 as it broke out of a one-month consolidation with the heaviest volume in weeks (1). The entry price was at 23.69, and by the end of the day the stock was already up nearly 2%. A couple days later, Huntsman hit a 5% profit goal (2). However, the Nasdaq composite was losing steam as it neared new highs, so half profits on Huntsman were taken at 24.90. In order to protect profit on the remaining shares, the stop was raised to 1% from the entry price. There is no reason to let a trade go negative once you have a decent profit.The stock fell from there, along with the market, but found support on April 4 and nearly recovered the ground lost (3). As the stock was approaching the level where half profits were taken, it looked like it could be running into resistance again. On the intraday chart, Huntsman seemed to be flattening out in the last two hours of trading and kept getting turned back at 24.80. So the decision was made to take the remaining profits for a total gain of 4.7% in five trading days.By April 12, Huntsman skidded back near its entry as the market sold off again.More details on past trades are available to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader.

25,FMC,"Stocks slid into a weak finish Friday as mixed consumer spending and income data, and an unexpected bump up in Midwest manufacturing helped confuse the end-of-quarter trade.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3%. The S&P 500 backed off 0.2% and the Nasdaq gave up its earlier gains to close flat. Small caps kept their chin up, leaving the Russell 2000 with a 0.3% gain.Volume ran lower both on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.For the month, the Nasdaq rose 1.7%, its fifth straight advance — leaving it up more than 21% over the past 12 months.

Intel (INTC) topped that group with a 0.9% gain.Cement and construction aggregates stocks posted Friday's strongest move among industries. Martin Marietta (MLM) jumped 3% after receiving an upgrade to buy, from neutral, from Cleveland Research. Citigroup had initiated coverage on Thursday on Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials (VMC), with buy ratings on both stocks.  Vulcan rose nearly 3% Friday. The day's gains left both stocks poised for a test of resistance at their 10-week moving averages.The alternative energy group posted a strong session, helped by TPI Composites' (TPIC) 4% advance. Barclays initiated coverage on the stock with a buy ranting and a 24 price target. The thinly-traded stock is in the sixth week of a possible base pattern, trading 73% above its July IPO price.Herbicide and insecticide maker FMC (FMC) easily topped the S&P 500, spiking 13% after DuPont (DD) announced FMC would acquire DuPont's crop protection products business for $1.2 billion in cash, as well as an exchange for FMC's health and nutrition unit. The gain put shares well above a a 62.13 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but the gap up breakout established a new buy range, starting at 69.72.The FMC sale was the first divestiture aimed at meeting regulatory requirements for the planned $77 billion merger between DuPont and Dow Chemical (DOW). The two companies today said they expect to close the deal in August. DuPont ended down 1.2% and Dow shares were off 0.5%.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) grabbed the second hottest slot among S&P 500 stocks, up more than 4% after Macquarie launched coverage on the stock, although at a neutral rating.

Shares are up 29% since Dec. 30.IBD Leaderboard stock Apple (AAPL) settled 0.1% lower Friday to take a 2.2% gain for the week.

26,FMC,"U.S. stock indexes were mixed midday Friday, as the Nasdaq headed toward its fifth up month in a row.The Nasdaq added 0.1%, within a handful of points of an all-time high on the stock market today. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.6%, one of the few indexes with a sizable gain. Volume in the stock market today was running lower vs. the previous session's pace.While the Nasdaq aimed for a gain of more than 1% in March, the S&P 500 was about flat, and the small cap Russell 2000 and Dow Jones industrial average were on track for losses for the month, ending their four month win streaks.Blue chips were mostly down midday Friday. Dow component Intel (INTC) was one of the few gainers, up 0.6% and on track for a 2% weekly gain. The big-cap chipmaker is just under its 10-week line. About three weeks ago, Intel announced a deal to acquire driver-assistance company Mobileye (MBLY). The acquisition is expected to be completed in nine months.IBD'S TAKE: Is it too late to buy when a quality stock gaps up over the ideal buy point? No!In the S&P 500, the day's biggest gainer was chemicals maker FMC Corp. (FMC). The stock burst 14% higher in torrid volume. FMC cleared a 62.94 buy point in a flat pattern. Because of the gap up over the ideal entry, the actionable buy point was the opening price of 71.63.FMC announced it is buying DuPont's (DD) crop protection business, which had to be divested because of a ruling by the European Commission. The EC decision was related to DuPont's merger with Dow Chemical (DOW). As part of the deal, DuPont will get FMC's health and nutrition unit.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, cement and infrastructure plays showed the day's biggest gain, up 2%.

"
30,FMC,"South Korea on Wednesday fined Qualcomm (QCOM) 1.03 trillion won ($853 million) for antitrust violations, following a similar move by China, raising questions about the wireless chipmaker's royalty revenues and sending shares lower in premarket action.Qualcomm used its market dominance in key chip fields to force smartphone makers to license a broad array of patents, often more than needed, the South Korean Fair Trade Commission said, justifying the record fine by the country. Qualcomm also didn't pay fair amounts for using other wireless chip patents, the government said. And it refused to license certain patents to other handset makers.Korea is home to Samsung Electronics, the world's No. 1 handset maker, as well as LG Electronics, another big user of Android operating software by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). The verdict makes it likely that Qualcomm may have to accept lower royalty payments, which account for the bulk of its profit.Qualcomm, for its part, rejected the charges.""This is an unprecedented and insupportable decision relating to licensing practices that have been in existence in Korea and worldwide for decades and that the KFTC reviewed but did not question in a previous investigation of Qualcomm,"" the company said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Mutual funds and other institutional buyers drive stocks by accumulating shares over time. Qualcomm, Applied Materials and chemicals firm FMC are key holdings for USAA Growth & Income Fund. USAA Growth & Income has outperformed its large-cap blend peers in 2016.Qualcomm expects to appeal the ultimate written decision. However, the company in February 2015 settled a China antitrust probe with a $975 million fine. And later it accept lower license fees in that country.The European Union a year ago accused Qualcomm of making ""significant"" payments to an unnamed big phone and tablet maker to use it chipsets exclusively as well as selling chips below cost to undercut smaller rival Icera, now owned by Nvidia (NVDA).U.S. and Taiwan regulators also are investigating the company.Apple (AAPL) is another notable wireless chip technology customer for Qualcomm.Qualcomm shares fell 2.2% to 65.75 on the stock market today after closing Tuesday just below their 50-day moving average. The stock hit a two-and-a-half-year high of 71.02 on Oct. 27.Apple shares fell 0.43% Wednesday. Nvidia, up 29% over the prior 10 sessions, fell 6.9% to 109.25. Alphabet dipped 0.66%.RELATED:Netflix, Alphabet Give FANG A Boost As Apple Nears Buy Point
"
31,FMC,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

33,FMC,"One of the leading ETFs is capitalizing on the growth of the mineral that makes it possible for smartphones to function for an entire workday and makes electric cars run.Global X Lithium (LIT) combines the key players in the industry's entire cycle, from the producers to the biggest users of the metal.The fund is forming a shallow pattern with a potential buy point at 26.05. Shares have been trading mostly above the 50-day moving average, providing the formation with a good foundation.Long-term, it has been a laggard, trending mainly lower since it peaked in January 2011. But the ETF made a 52% run from February to early June before it settled into its current base. Week-to-week volume has swelled since late March, suggesting growing investor interest in the Global X Lithium.The fund holds 24 stocks, including some that are not traded on U.S. exchanges. Two stocks have an outsized representation, accounting for more than 30% of the portfolio: FMC (FMC) and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM). The two companies are among the top four global producers of lithium.Shares of Sociedad Quimica broke out of a flat base Thursday, leaping past a 26.43 buy point in heavy trading. The mining company beat second-quarter profit expectations late Wednesday. The bullish move, however, didn't carry over much to the ETF, which inched higher.Sociedad Quimica, which is the world's biggest producer of lithium, has faced legal troubles in its home country. In the past two years, authorities have accused the company of market manipulation and questionable tax invoices. It is also in arbitration with economic development agency Corfo over royalties, Reuters reported.Investors wanting to get a sense for the ETF's performance should watch the chart of FMC. The stock, which comprises more than 20% of Global X Lithium, is forming a base with a 50.67 entry.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks breaking out of stock chart patterns often go on to score big gains with reduced chance of forcing you to sell at a loss.Albemarle (ALB), another major lithium producer, accounts for about 6% of the ETF's portfolio. The North Carolina-based company also is forming a base. The stock surged nearly 50% since clearing resistance near the 60 price level in March.Tesla Motors (TSLA) is a smaller holding. The automaker's stock has been consolidating since April and is nearly 20% off its 52-week high.Lithium — which is used in products from AA batteries to the 787 Dreamliner — remains in big demand. The aggressive expansion of Tesla's battery-powered cars has been a big reason for that.With production lagging demand, lithium prices have been firm, Bloomberg reports. But an analyst with London-based Roskill Information Services expects prices will peak in the second quarter of 2017 as more lithium production comes into the market. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

34,FMC,"Among investors in the largest U.S. companies, no pay package is less popular than the one given to Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares.Only 23% of the shares of the housewares retailer were voted in support of its compensation plan at an annual meeting on July 1, the lowest level in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shareholders told the board that the CEO's $19.4 million pay for 2015 was too high, and that his performance goals weren't challenging enough, the Union, N.J.-based company said in its May proxy statement.New York Comptroller Scott Stringer, representing city pension funds, weighed in on the matter with a letter to Bed, Bath & Beyond investors. There's a ""gaping and persistent disconnect between CEO pay and company performance,"" he wrote. The retirement funds, with $160 billion in assets, are among the company's 60 largest shareholders.Bed, Bath & Beyond, which sells everything from coffee to accent rugs, is reducing Temares' target compensation by 14% for 2016 and is making his performance goals more rigorous, according to its proxy statement. Janet Barth, a spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing.Shareholder disapproval of Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay practices contrasts with a falling number of businesses that fail in so-called say-on-pay votes. About 1% of S&P 500 companies have lost in their most recent nonbinding votes, and the average support level is 93%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Temares' 2015 package was his largest ever, even as shares fell by more than a third. His pay tops that awarded to Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) CEO John Stumpf and approaches that given to IBM's (IBM) Virginia Rometty. The awards include a $4 million salary and $15.7 million in stock and options. That was an increase of about $1.1 million from his 2014 package. The exact amount of stock that 57-year-old Temares will receive may change depending on how Bed, Bath & Beyond performs against a group of 47 other companies on earnings and return-on-capital measures.A University of Pennsylvania law graduate who primarily worked in real estate, Temares joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in 1992 before its debut on public exchanges to oversee property transactions as it expanded. Its footprint has grown to more than 1,500 stores from 62 two decades ago. He was promoted to CEO in 2003, earning a $931,000 salary during his first year in the top job.Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay plan also failed with investors last year. The company determined it would make some changes after contacting 25 investors representing 68% of shares, the chain said in the May 31 proxy.Temares' target compensation was reduced to $16.9 million for 2016 in a plan that will be voted on next year. His $4 million salary, the third-largest in the S&P index, will stay the same. He receives the large salary in lieu of a smaller one and a potential bonus, because ""cash bonuses promote short-term thinking,"" according to the filing.Still, Institutional Shareholder Services describes the CEO's salary as ""excessive"" and notes that it could bloat his golden parachute to $46 million if the company gets bought. The proxy adviser gave Bed, Bath & Beyond a rating of 10, its worst governance score, meaning its structure may have a greater probability of risks to its reputation, long-term value or fiduciary obligations.Bed, Bath & Beyond is joined by car-parts maker BorgWarner (BWA), chemical producer FMC Corp. (FMC), mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP), and utilities owner Exelon (EXC) in receiving less than 50% support in its most recent vote. Representatives of Exelon and BorgWarner said the companies take the votes seriously and are seeking investor feedback. The other companies didn't return requests for comment.In addition to Bed, Bath & Beyond, only Oracle (ORCL) has received less than 50% support in two consecutive years. The Redwood City, Calif.-based software maker is on its fourth failed year. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment.Stringer noted Bed, Bath & Beyond's compensation committee members Dean Adler, Stanley Barshay and Victoria Morrison have each served on the board for more than 13 years, which ""highlights the need for new directors that are able to exercise strong, independent oversight of management."" Each received about 65% support after calls by Stringer and ISS to oust them. The committee doesn't have a chair, which is rare.

Schlumberger rose 1.4%, while Halliburton dipped 0.35%.Together FMC and Technip had revenue of $20 billion last year, more than Baker Hughes (BHI) and just under Halliburton and Schlumberger.Oilfield service providers are looking at mergers, as oil prices continue to remain under pressure. Schlumberger bought Cameron International last year. But Halliburton scrapped its takeover of Baker Hughes over worries it wouldn't pass antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe.Oilfield service providers have also scaled back their workforces to try to cut costs. Technip said last year it would cut 6,000 jobs. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have made deep cuts as well, collectively laying off tens of thousands of workers.

Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%.

73,FMC,"Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) has entered into a deal to sell its royalty portfolio to an emerging precious metals royalty and streaming company, Maverix Metals Inc. The strategic partnership will provide Newmont an ongoing exposure to Maverix’s growing portfolio of 27 high-quality royalties and streams, out of which 10 are on producing mines.Per the agreement, Newmont will receive $17 million in cash, 60 million common shares of Maverix (representing roughly 28% ownership interest) and warrants for an additional 10 million common shares. The transaction is expected to close in second-quarter 2018.Notably, Newmont’s royalty portfolio consists of 54 precious metals and industrial minerals royalties, including royalties at Premier Gold’s McCoy Cove project in Nevada and TMAC Resources’ Hope Bay mine in Canada.With regards to this transaction, both parties will ink a shareholder agreement that will entitle Newmont to have a seat on Maverix’s board and pre-emptive rights to take part in future financings of the company to maintain its ownership stake.Newmont’s shares have moved up 4.6% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 3.5% decline. During first-quarter 2018 earnings call, Newmont stated that it continues to expect attributable gold production in the range of 4.9-5.4 million ounces for 2018 and 2019. The company also kept its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) and costs applicable to sales (CAS) for gold unchanged for 2018 in the range of $965-$1,025 per ounce and $700-$750 per ounce, respectively.Notably, the company’s projected AISC for 2018 is higher than $924 recorded for full-year 2017. Newmont’s AISC rose 8% to $973 in the first quarter, mainly due to higher per unit CAS, higher exploration costs and increased spending on advanced projects. Increased project spending is expected to keep AISC at elevated levels. As such, the company’s high production costs remain a concern for 2018.However, Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects as it continues to invest in growth projects in a calculated manner, including Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa and Twin Underground in North America.Last year, the company successfully started commercial production at its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine.

78,FMC,"The chemical industry is riding an upturn in the global economy and strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive. Improving fundamentals in the energy space driven by an upswing in crude oil prices also augur well for the industry.Notwithstanding a few headwinds, including a spike in raw materials costs and softness in agricultural commodity prices, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum witnessed in Q1 into Q2 as the fundamental driving factors remain in place.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. The Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that racked up the strongest gains in Q1. Overall earnings for the sector climbed 56.4% while revenues spiked 24.3%. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 54% in Q2 while revenues are expected to go up 24.1%, per our latest Earnings Preview.Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry-wide margin improvements in Q2. Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices) to offset raw materials cost inflation, which should also provide margin benefits.Chemical companies also remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and perk up growth. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings in Q2.  President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform also contributed to the impressive performance of the U.S. chemical makers in Q1 and would continue to be a major tailwind in Q2. The newly introduced tax reform significantly reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is a positive for chemical stocks. This is expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flows and incentivize capital investment.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major chemical stocks – Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) – to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their Q2 earnings report. Both companies are scheduled to report their Q2 numbers on Jul 19.While Celanese carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PPG is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's take a closer look at how Celanese and PPG are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Celanese is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.80% and a Zacks Rank #2. However, the picture is different for PPG with an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #3, a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult.With respect to surprise, Celanese beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7%. On the other hand, PPG beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters while missed once and met expectations on the other occasion. In this timeframe, it came up with an average positive surprise of 0.1%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Celanese scores above PPG. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Celanese for Q2 currently stands at 32.4% compared with an expected rise of 3.3% for PPG.Price PerformanceCelanese’s shares have rallied 16.7% over the past year and outperformed the industry over the same period. On the other hand, PPG’s shares have lost 6.3% and underperformed the industry. As such, Celanese clearly scores above PPG. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Celanese has a debt-to-equity ratio of 102.8, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 34.5. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 95.5 PPG wins this round. Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Celanese is a winner with a current ratio of 1.88, which is superior to PPG’s reading of 1.76. Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for PPG stands at 3.6%, which is higher than 3% for Celanese. ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value chemical stocks, PPG looks cheaper compared with Celanese.Both Celanese and PPG are underpriced, with EV/EBITDA ratios of 12.3 and 11.2, respectively, compared with the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.5. Clearly, PPG is cheaper and scores on this front. Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Celanese and PPG is 35.2% and 26.5%, respectively. As such, Celanese hasan edge here. The VerdictOur comparative analysis shows that PPG holds an edge over Celanese in terms of valuation, free cash flow yields and debt-to-equity ratio. However, when considering price performance, earnings surprise history, earnings growth projections, ROE measures and current ratio, Celanese seems to be the preferred stock. On top of that, the company has a better ESP reading vis-à-vis PPG. As the scale is clearly tipped in favor of Celanese, it makes a better investment proposition.Some Other Stocks to Consider Apart from Celanese, investors interested in the chemical space may also consider FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2. FMC has an expected earnings growth of 258.3% for Q2.

82,FMC,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) has completed the previously announced acquisition of Heartland Steel Processing, LLC, formerly known as Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, LLC (Heartland), from CSN Steel, S.L.U., for $400 million in cash (including $60 million of normalized working capital), subject to customary transaction purchase price adjustments.The deal was funded with available cash with an expectation of near-term cash flow and earnings per share accretion. Per the company, the buyout will expand its total steel shipping capability to 12.4 million tons and annual flat roll steel shipping capacity to 8.4 million tons. Moreover, the additional exposure to greater width and lighter-gauge flat roll steel offerings will expand the company’s value-added product portfolio, boosting its position as one of the leading steel producers of North America.  Located in Terre Haute, IN, Heartland produces a range of higher-margin, flat roll steel by further processing hot roll coils into cold roll, pickle and oil and galvanized products.  Heartland has the capability to produce 1 million tons of cold roll steel annually, with galvanizing capacity of 360,000 tons. It has a continuous pickle line, a cold mill and a galvanizing line. Moreover, its equipment is well-maintained, upgraded and in excellent operating condition.Historically, Heartland has primarily focused on galvanized products and has operated at low utilization rate. Future plans include utilization of the full capacity of the facility, providing high quality pickle and oil, cold roll and galvanized products. Additionally, geographic proximity of Steel Dynamics' certain fabrication locations and other flat roll operations provide opportunities related to production and logistics efficiencies throughout the supply chain and customer network.Steel Dynamics’ shares have gained 4.3% in the past three months against the industry’s 4.6% decline.Last month, the company provided an upbeat earnings guidance for second-quarter 2018. The company expects earnings for the quarter in the band of $1.46 to $1.50 per share. This is an increase from 96 cents recorded in the previous quarter and 63 cents earned a year ago.Steel Dynamics expects profitability from its steel operations to improve meaningfully on a sequential basis in the second quarter on the back of higher steel shipments and metal spread expansion. Also, average quarterly steel product prices are expected to increase more than scrap costs. This is because prices of steel across the platform improved throughout the quarter aided by strong steel demand in the domestic market, the company noted.Steel Dynamics, Inc.

87,FMC,"On Jun 28, we issued an updated research report on Royal Gold, Inc. (RGLD  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from improved production and progress in ramping up of new mines, as well as its debt-reduction efforts. However, inadequate water supplies at Mount Milligan and volatile gold prices are expected to affect its results.Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail.Royal Gold to Gain From New MinesRoyal Gold expects to start initial production from Peñasquito Pyrite Leach in LaRonde Zone 5 later in calendar year 2018, followed by Cortez Crossroads’ production. The company will also release the preliminary economic assessment at Peak Gold. Notably, Royal Gold expects production at Rainy River to improve throughout this calendar year, by approximately 15% to 24,000 tons per day, due to improvements in output, grade and recoveries.Debt Reduction Activities on TrackRoyal Gold reduced its debt for the fifth straight quarter by paying down another $75 million during third-quarter fiscal 2018. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, the company continues to expect to pay down debt aggressively and will fully repay the remaining $75-million outstanding under its revolving credit facility by the end of this June.Following the repayment of the revolving credit facility, Royal Gold’s only remaining indebtedness will be $370 million of convertible bonds, slated to mature in June 2019. Currently, it plans to repay the principal amount of bonds in cash using cash flow and availability under $1-billion revolving credit facility.

89,FMC,"Picking breakout stocks is one of the most favored methods for those utilizing an active investing approach since this strategy promises superlative returns. This method involved zeroing in on those stocks whose prices are varying within a narrow band. If the price of the stock falls below this channel, it could be the best time to sell off this stock.However, the best time to buy a stock as per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band. Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains.Identifying Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks, you must first determine their resistance and support levels. A resistance level is a barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock. Meanwhile, a support level is the floor for the stock’s movement.At the breakout level, the demand for the stock has peaked, making it a natural choice for traders. On the other hand, when a stock hits the support floor, traders are eager to offload it. In order to spot breakout stocks, you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those that have just breached this level.Checking Whether It’s for RealStocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders. But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support. This is why it is important to determine whether a long-term price trend is about to emerge.Only a study of long-term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively. This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels. If you can identify the effective channel for a stock, picking it even at a not-so-reasonable price would give you significant returns.Screening Parameters• Percentage price change over four weeks between 10% and 20% (Stocks which are showing considerable price increases, but whose gains are not excessive.)• Current Price /52-Week High greater than or equal to 0.9 (Stocks which are trading 90% close to their 52-week highs.)• Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2(Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)• Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2 (Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit.)• Current price less than or equal to $20 (Stocks which are reasonably priced.)These criteria narrow down the universe of over 7875 stocks to only 9.Here are the top 5 stocks that meet these criteria: Each of these has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Notwithstanding some headwinds, the industry’s upturn is expected to continue in the short haul as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place.  The chemical diversified industry, which includes manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics and agricultural chemicals, seems to be in fine fettle and poised for growth in the near term. While companies in this space face margin headwind from a spike in raw materials costs as a result of short supply, softness in agricultural commodity prices due to persistent grain glut and trade war risks, they should continue gaining from strategic measures including productivity improvement, price increase actions, portfolio restructuring, expansion into high-growth markets and earnings-accretive acquisitions.President Trump’s business-friendly tax reform, which contributed to the recent impressive earnings performance of the U.S. chemical diversified companies, would remain a major tailwind. The tax reform is expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flows and incentivize capital investments in new chemical projects.Industry Trails on Shareholder Returns  The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry, which is a 44-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year. While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 10.2%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Basic Materials Sector have rallied 14.3% and 21.8%, respectively.The underperformance appears to partly reflect trade-related worries for the chemical industry. Fears of a fierce trade war between the United States and China have gripped the markets since March 2018. The good fortunes of the chemical industry have been, of late, clouded by prospects of a trade war between Washington and Beijing.The Trump administration, in March, proposed sweeping tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports including chemicals. China subsequently retaliated with plans to levy 25% tariffs on nearly $50 billion of U.S. imports that would harm a major market for a range of U.S.-produced chemicals and plastics. The United States is pushing ahead with its plans and recently announced a new list of Chinese products slated for tariffs, thereby intensifying chances of a trade battle.Threats of tariffs on U.S. chemical exports by China and the Trump administration’s actions to impose heavy tariffs on steel imports have raised concerns that chemicals companies would reconsider their investments in new projects, which would lead to a slowdown in growth. The hefty steel tariffs are likely to push up the costs of building chemical plants that use a significant amount of steel, thereby eroding the economic benefits of chemical projects. All these have left investors jittery about the prospects of the chemical industry.One-Year Price Performance The Group’s Valuation Looks Bit StretchedNotwithstanding the underperformance of the industry over the past year, the valuation doesn’t look cheap now. One might get a good sense of the chemical diversified industry’s relative valuation by looking at its EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.The EV/EBITDA multiple is a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like chemicals that have significant fluctuations in earnings from one quarter to the next. Notably, the value of commodity companies is dependent on the movement of prices of commodities and growth in the underlying industry/economy, both of which typically move in cycles.  Going by this multiple, valuation for the chemical diversified industry looks a bit stretched at the moment when compared to the broader market and its own sector.The industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.8, which is below its own average of 14.2 and the highest level of 19.8 in the past one year. However, the industry compares unfavorably with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is at 11.6 and the median level is 11.3.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (TTM)Moreover, a comparison of the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector indicates that the group is trading at a premium. Zacks Basic Materials Sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.3 and the median level of 10.2 for the same period are below the respective ratios of the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry. As such, there seems to be little room for an upside moving ahead.Earnings Outlook Paints Favorable PictureChemical diversified stocks are expected to continue delivering positive shareholder returns over the near term on the back of favorable end-market fundamentals and expectations of industry-wide margin improvement driven by cost-cutting and productivity measures and price increase actions to offset higher feedstock costs. But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.While one could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number, an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry of $5.13 per share reflects a 2.6% year-over-year improvement. Also, the trend in earnings estimate revisions appears favorable. Price and Consensus: Zacks Chemicals Diversified Industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are hopeful of this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised positively (by a penny) since Mar 31, 2018. Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a positive picture for the near term.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #49, which places it at the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been hovering in the top half over the past eight weeks.  Long-Term Growth Prospects Look PromisingThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry appears upbeat. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has been increasing since May 2018 to reach the current level of 10.6%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate One key reason for this long-term EPS growth could be the recovery in top line that stocks in this industry group have been showing since the beginning of 2017.  Another important indication of solid long-term prospect is the improvement in the group’s EBITDA, which is an important metric for evaluating chemical stocks. Bottom LineCompanies in the chemical diversified space are hamstrung by a few challenges including feedstock cost pressure, weakness in agricultural commodity prices and concerns over trade tariffs. However, strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions, operational efficiency improvement and continued focus on cost and productivity should help them weather the macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds over the short haul.The industry’s momentum is expected to continue on sustained demand strength across automotive and construction markets, a rebound in demand in the energy space and investment on capacity expansion.Cost-cutting and productivity improvement actions are expected to reap industry-wide margin improvements. Moreover, price hike actions by these companies in the wake of rising raw materials costs should also provide margin benefits. Continued shift of focus on high-growth markets should also allow them lower their exposure on businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure.There are many reasons to be optimistic about the chemical diversified industry over the near future. Keeping the long-term expectations in mind, it would be prudent to bet on a few stocks in this space that have a strong earnings outlook.Below we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report): The consensus EPS estimate for this Wilmington-based company has moved 5.9% higher for the current year, over the last 60 days.

97,FMC,"Investors looking for stocks in the Chemical - Diversified sector might want to consider either Methanex (MEOH  -  Free Report) or FMC (FMC  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Methanex and FMC are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively, right now. This means that MEOH's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.MEOH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.03, while FMC has a forward P/E of 14.56. We also note that MEOH has a PEG ratio of 0.74. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FMC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.02.Another notable valuation metric for MEOH is its P/B ratio of 3.12. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FMC has a P/B of 3.97.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MEOH's Value grade of A and FMC's Value grade of D.MEOH has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than FMC, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MEOH is the superior option right now.

98,FMC,"Shares of Ingevity Corporation (NGVT  -  Free Report) have rallied 43.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of roughly 1.2%.The company has a market cap of roughly $3.4 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months was around 230.8K. It has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 12%.  Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Driving FactorsForecast-topping earnings performance, upbeat outlook and solid growth prospects are contributing to the rally in Ingevity’s shares.The company recorded a profit of $35.8 million or 72 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018, up roughly 56% from $23 million or 45 cents a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents.Notably, Ingevity topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 20.2%.Ingevity, in May, narrowed and increased the mid-point for full-year 2018 guidance for sales and adjusted EBITDA. It now expects sales for the year in the range of $1.10-$1.13 billion compared with prior view of $1.07-$1.13 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $293 million and $307 million compared with prior view of $285-$305 million.The company is expected to gain from its strategy to pursue value-creating acquisitions. Earlier this year, the company closed the buyout of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemicals business for $310 million. The acquisition contributed roughly $5 million to Performance Chemicals division’s sales and $2 million to the segment EBITDA in the first quarter. The buyout is expected to create net synergies of roughly $11 million through manufacturing optimization, lower logistics costs and leveraged procurement costs.Moreover, the Performance Chemicals unit is likely to gain from higher adoption of TOFA-based products. Also, a recovery in TOFA prices had considerable positive impact on overall margins of the division in the last reported quarter. Ingevity expects its high margin application areas to continue strengthening, going forward.Ingevity Corporation Price and Consensus Ingevity Corporation Price and Consensus | Ingevity Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Moreover, the ACC envisions output of plastic resins to rise at the fastest clip since 2012 on the back of new capacity and firming demand for both domestic and overseas customers. Improving industrial activities are also expected to contribute to the growth of the specialty chemicals segment.U.S. Chemical Industry Poised for Solid UpsideThe outlook for the American chemical industry paints an encouraging picture. The ACC envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.4% in 2018 and further gain steam with a 3.6% growth in 2019.The trade group sees strong growth in several chemical sectors in including petrochemicals, fertilizers, crop protection, coatings and consumer products. It expects production to continue to expand across all regions of the United States this year, with the Gulf Coast region seeing the strongest gains.The growth in output is expected to be spurred by an upswing in U.S. manufacturing, higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and strengthening export markets. While the automotive sector is expected to remain at high levels, steady recovery in housing is expected to continue in 2018.Export Markets, Shale-linked Investments Drive U.S. ChemicalThe ACC expects strengthening export markets to contribute to growth of the U.S. chemical industry this year. It sees two-way trade between the United States and its foreign partners to expand 6.2% year over year and reach $241 billion this year (after growing 6% in 2017), aided by strong demand from overseas markets and domestic manufacturers downstream.The trade group also expects U.S. chemicals exports to expand 7.2% in 2018 to $139.2 billion on the back of the basic chemicals sector. Higher exports will result in the United States having a $71.4 billion trade surplus in chemicals by 2023.The United States also remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical industry continue to enjoy the competitive advantage of access to abundant supplies of shale gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Economics of shale gas is driving strong capital investment in new chemical projects, leading to growth in the domestic chemical industry.According to the ACC, roughly 325 chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth around $194 billion that are under construction or complete. The projects include investment in new factories, expansions and restarts of plants across the United States. Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.

The company’s expansion initiatives are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings.  Moreover, LyondellBasell, in February, agreed to buy A. Schulman in a deal worth $2.25 billion. The company, last month, secured the U.S. antitrust clearance for its proposed buyout. The buyout doubles the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business. It also creates a platform for future growth with reach into additional high-growth markets such as packaging and consumer products, electronics and appliances, building and construction, and agriculture. The acquisition will enable the company to offer a comprehensive range of innovative solutions to customers. LyondellBasell expects to capture $150 million in run-rate cost synergies within two years. Moreover, LyondellBasell and SUEZ, last month, completed a transaction that makes them 50/50 partner in the Netherlands-based premium plastics recycling company, Quality Circular Polymers. For many years, LyondellBasell has been witnessing increased demand for reused and recycled plastics, particularly in Europe.

127,FMC,"Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) said that it is proceeding with the initial Gilmore expansion project at its Fort Knox mine, Alaska.The company expects the project to extend Fort Knox’s mining by six years to 2027 and leaching to 2030 and also increase mine life production by roughly 1.5 million gold equivalent ounces. Notably, the project involves a low initial capital cost of roughly $100 million.The project is likely to generate net present value (NPV) of $130 million and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 17%, considering gold prices at $1,200 per ounce. Based on a gold price of $1,300 per ounce, the project is expected to generate an NPV of $239 million and IRR of 26%.Per Kinross, the project is not only a low-cost, low-risk brownfield expansion that can considerably extend mine life to 2030, but it will also strengthen the company’s long-term production profile in the United States.The Gilmore project adds to Kinross’ quality development projects including Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Tasiast and Kupol and also enhances its globally diverse portfolio. The project will be funded by Fort Knox’s cash flow, given its low initial capital cost. This will help the company to preserve its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.Notably, during first-quarter 2018, Kinross’ adjusted operating cash flow was $363.7 million, up from $250.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $997.9 million as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $819 million as of Mar 31, 2017. Long-term debt was essentially flat year over year at $1,733.2 million and there are no scheduled debt repayments due for the company until 2021.Kinross’ shares have gained 4.7% over the past three months, slightly underperforming the industry’s 5.5% rise.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderKinross currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report), Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) and Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

128,FMC,"We are positive on Ingevity Corporation’s (NGVT  -  Free Report) prospects and believe that the time is right for you to buy the stock as it looks promising and is poised to continue the momentum.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock an attractive investment option.What Makes NGVT an Attractive PickAn Outperformer: Ingevity has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past six months. The company’s shares have gained 16% compared with roughly 1% growth recorded by the industry.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Ingevity’s ROE of 48.1% compared with the industry average of 15.8%, reflects the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds.  Strong Earnings Growth Prospects & Impressive Surprise History: Ingevity has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12%, higher than the industry average of 10.9%.The company has also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 20.2%.Upbeat Outlook: In first-quarter 2018, Ingevity narrowed and increased the mid-point for full-year 2018 guidance for sales and adjusted EBITDA.It now expects sales for the year in the range of $1.10-$1.13 billion compared with prior view of $1.07-$1.13 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $293 million and $307 million compared with prior view of $285-$305 million.Acquisitions & TOFA-based Products to Drive Results: Ingevity is expected to gain from its strategy to pursue value-creating acquisitions. Earlier this year, the company closed the buyout of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemicals business for $310 million. During first-quarter 2018, the acquisition contributed roughly $5 million in sales of Performance Chemicals division and $2 million in the segment EBITDA. The buyout is expected to create net synergies of roughly $11 million through manufacturing optimization, lower logistics costs and leveraged procurement costs.Moreover, higher adoption of TOFA-based products is driving results for the company’s Performance Chemicals division. Also, a recovery in TOFA prices had considerable positive impact on the overall margins of the division in the last reported quarter. The company expects its high margin application areas to continue strengthening, going forward.Ingevity Corporation Price and Consensus Ingevity Corporation Price and Consensus | Ingevity Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report), Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) and Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

129,FMC,"Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens.The industrial gas producer and supplier performed well in the last four quarters. Average earnings surprise was a positive 3.00%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.52 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.70%.In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 4.7% return, outperforming the decline of 2.8% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement. Factors to Affect Q1 ResultsWe believe that Praxair’s growth opportunities are directly correlated with industrial activities in the United States and that of the foreign nations it serves. Available data for few economic indicators clearly reflect that operating conditions were quite favorable for industrial companies in the first quarter of 2018. Industrial production grew at an annual rate of 4.5% while the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index for March pointed toward an expanding manufacturing sector. Growing U.S. housing markets, along with expanding domestic and world economy, support growth of industrial stocks.For the North America segment, Praxair will gain from rising demand for gases for industrial use, especially in the metals, chemicals, downstream energy and manufacturing end markets. Also, the company’s efforts to expand business in non-industrial areas will be fruitful. In this regard, long-term agreement (signed in January 2018) to supply nitrogen to EverDisplay Optronics' AMOLED (6th generation) project is worth mentioning.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the North America segment’s revenues stands at $1,552 million for the first quarter, above $1,542 million recorded in the previous quarter. Also, the segment’s average sales surprise for the last two quarters was a positive 2.61%.For South America, a lot depends on the political uncertainties in Brazil that have somewhat stalled the growth prospects in the region. However, Argentina seems a decent market for the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the South America segment’s revenues stands at $383 million for the first quarter, above $370 million recorded in the previous quarter.For the Asia segment, growth in demand for gases for the use in electronics end market, especially by Chinese and Korean customers, is believed to be a boon. For the Europe segment, manufacturing and metals industries are demanding more industrial gases.Praxair anticipates increasing its margins on the back of favorable pricing and volumes in the first quarter of 2018. Earnings are anticipated to be $1.53-$1.58 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12-15%. This projection includes 5 cents of gain from the latest tax reform in the country. However, seasonal weakness, due to Carnival and Lunar New Year as well as slower activities in the U.S. Gulf Coast, might slow down the growth momentum. Earnings WhisperOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release earnings results.

130,FMC,"Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on Apr 26.Eastman Chemical’s profits increased in the fourth quarter of 2017, aided by strong growth of high-margin products in its specialty businesses. The company recorded profit of $581 million or $4.01 per share, a five-fold rise from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $116 million or 79 cents. Adjusted earnings of $1.62 per share trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06.Eastman Chemical has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year. The company’s shares have gained around 32.1% over this period, compared with roughly 10.9% gain recorded by the industry. Eastman Chemical topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of roughly 17.7%.Is the company poised for another winning quarter? Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Watch ForEastman Chemical, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects to drive growth on the back of growth investments, innovation and high margin products. It also sees modestly lower tax rate to support earnings growth. Eastman Chemical projects adjusted earnings per share growth in 2018 to be 8-12% year over year.Revenues for Eastman Chemical for the first quarter is projected to rise roughly 6.9% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at $2,461 million.Revenues from Eastman Chemical’s Additives and Functional Products division is anticipated to witness an 8.9% rise from the year ago figure as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $842 million.Advanced Materials unit’s revenues are expected to increase 6.5% from the year ago quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is $675 million.Revenues for the Chemical Intermediates segment are projected to rise 6% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter stands at $710 million.Meanwhile, the Fibers segment is expected to witness a 5.2% year over year decline in revenues as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $202 million for the first quarter.Eastman Chemical’s high margin products and its aggressive cost management actions are likely to continue to drive its earnings in the first quarter. The company should gain from sustained growth of its high margins specialty products.The company is focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions, which is helping it to offset raw material cost inflation and other cost headwinds. The company expects to realize $100 million of cost savings in 2018 under its cost-reduction program.Eastman Chemical should also gain from synergies of acquisitions, especially Taminco Corporation. The Taminco acquisition has provided attractive cost and revenue synergy opportunities.However, Eastman Chemical continues to face pricing pressure in its Fibers unit. Lower prices of acetate tow are hurting the Fibers unit. Lower industry capacity utilization is affecting acetate tow prices.Eastman Chemical is also exposed to raw material pricing headwinds. In particular, the company’s chemical intermediates business is seeing a spike in raw materials costs, as witnessed in the last reported quarter. Raw materials cost headwind is expected to persist in the first quarter. The company expects raw material and energy prices, especially for olefins, to be volatile through 2018.Nevertheless, the company’s productivity measures and actions to increase selling prices of its products are expected to help it offset the impact of these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eastman Chemical Company price-eps-surprise | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Eastman Chemical is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

The company’s shares have rallied around 27.8% over this period, compared with roughly 11.3% gain recorded by the industry. Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last two quarters, upbeat outlook for 2018 and the Trump administration’s trade actions on imported steel have contributed to the rally in the company’s shares. Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at PlayU.S. Steel, last month, updated its full-year 2018 guidance. For the year, the company now expects EBITDA of roughly $1.7 billion (up from roughly $1.5 billion expected earlier), considering the potential market conditions resulting from the Section 232 actions and increased shipments from Granite City Works. It expects EBITDA to be roughly $250 million for the first quarter.U.S. Steel stated that the revised guidance considers two factors, namely, the market dynamics related to President Trump’s decision to impose 25% tariff on steel imports and the recently announced restarting of one of the two blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities at Granite City Works.Once the restarting process is completed, U.S. Steel expects roughly 100,000 tons of incremental shipments per month from Granite City Works.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized price for the USSE unit is $663 per net ton, representing an expected 11.6% rise on year over year basis. Average realized price for the Tubular segment is expected to increase 21.5% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1,333 per net ton.Steel prices are on an upswing in the United States on the back of the Trump administration’s trade actions to curb imports, reflected by the recent sharp rise in hot-rolled steel prices. Higher steel prices are expected to support U.S. Steel’s results in the first quarter.Meanwhile, U.S. Steel is actively engaged in improving its cost structure and operations on a sustainable basis through its “Carnegie Way” initiative that includes actions such as manufacturing process/logistics improvements and savings on selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. The company realized Carnegie Way benefits of $491 million for full-year 2017, mostly in its Flat-Rolled division.

141,FMC,"The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG  -  Free Report) recently said that consumer purchases of its lawn and garden products in May were at a record high of $565 million, leading to the near-full recovery of the decline reported by the company during the first seven months of the fiscal year.For the U.S. Consumer division, consumer purchases were nearly flat from 2017 levels on a year-to-date basis through Jun 10 with lawn fertilizer, growing media, grass seed and mulch witnessing positive growth. Consumer purchases were also positive in the Home Center and Hardware channels, which were partly offset by continued declines in the mass retail channel.The company now envisions reported sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 0-2% compared with prior view of 2-4% rise. Per the company, the updated guidance projects a decline in U.S. Consumer sales of 1-3% against the prior forecast of 0-2% growth.Sales at the Hawthorne division are projected to grow 25-30% for fiscal 2018 on the back of the recently completed acquisition of Sunlight Supply. Notably, the unit’s sales are expected to decline modestly compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the buyout.Despite falling short of original expectations this year, the company is impressed with the stability of its U.S. Consumer business along with the continued long-term prospects and cost savings opportunities associated with the Hawthorne unit.Scotts Miracle-Gro projects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.70-$3.90 per share, which includes dilution of roughly 30-40 cents associated with the Sunlight transaction. Moreover, it expects a decline in the gross margin rate of 250-300 basis points (bps) (up from earlier guidance of a decline of 50-100 bps).The company said that the addition of Sunlight is likely to negatively impact the rate by roughly 100 bps, partly due to product mix and purchase accounting adjustments. The remaining of the increased rate pressure is due to company-wide higher-than-expected distribution costs and lower volume.Moreover, the combination of the slow start to the season and improved inventory planning by its retail partners is causing the company to lower sales outlook for the U.S. Consumer segment.Recently, the company also took actions that resulted in annualized savings of $15 million with regards to its commitment to achieve $35 million in synergies from the Sunlight buyout. Also, it anticipates further actions by the end of the current fiscal year and expects total savings to be mostly realized by the end of calendar year 2019.Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (The) Price and Consensus Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (The) Price and Consensus | Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (The) QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderScotts Miracle-Gro currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24.Last quarter, the mining company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.1% by posting adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents.Revenues went up around 15.2% year over year to $5,041 million, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,811.2 million.Notably, Freeport beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing the other two, with an average negative surprise of 1.4%.Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Freeport-McMoRan Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayFreeport, during fourth-quarter earnings call, stated that the company anticipates consolidated sales volumes for 2018 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 675,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first-quarter 2018.The company assumes average prices of $3.15 per pound of copper and $1,300 per ounce of gold for 2018. Notably, average realized prices for copper and gold were $3.21 per pound (up from $2.48 a year ago) and $1,285 per ounce (from $1,174 a year ago), respectively, in the fourth quarter. The company gained from higher copper prices in the last reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues is $4,760 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of around 42.5%. Meanwhile, consolidated copper production for the first quarter is expected to fall 2.6% from the prior quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 991 million pounds.Total copper sales from Freeport’s North American Copper Mines for the first quarter are projected to witness a 4.8% rise sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 371 million pounds. The segment’s sales volume decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades.  Total copper sales from the company’s South American Mining are expected to see a 2.6% decrease from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 304 million pounds.  Copper sales from Indonesia Mining are expected to fall around 10% on a sequential basis as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at 316 million pounds. However, gold sales from Indonesia Mining are projected to increase roughly 1% from last quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 590,000 ounces.Rising unit net cash costs for copper in Freeport’s North American operation is a concern. Unit net cash cost per pound of copper for North America increased from $1.41 in 2016 to $1.57 in 2017, and is expected to be roughly $1.67 per pound this year, mainly reflecting lower expected sales volumes. Also, the unit net costs for South American mines increased last year due to higher mining and milling costs at Cerro Verde and lower sales volumes.Nevertheless, Freeport should gain from favorable copper market conditions, its focus on productivity along with cost and capital discipline.Shares of Freeport have lost 3.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.9% decline. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

159,FMC,"We issued an updated research report on Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) on Jun 1.With approximately $44.9 billion market capitalization, this industrial gas producer and supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), a revision from its earlier Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock’s investment appeal is further accentuated by a VGM Score of B.It’s worth mentioning here that in June 2017 Praxair signed an agreement to merge with Linde AG. The all-stock transaction currently awaits regulatory approvals and is anticipated to be completed in the second half of 2018. The resultant company is believed to be a leading industrial gas company with strong international presence, a large customer base and solid financial flexibility.Let’s delve deeper and discuss why investors should consider adding Praxair’s stock to their portfolio.Financial & Share Price Performances, Earnings Estimate Revision: Praxair’s financial performance has remained better-than-expected for quite some time now. Earnings beat of 5.77% for the first quarter of 2018 marks the company’s fourteenth consecutive quarter of impressive results. Also, over the same period, earnings have grown from $1.57 per share to $1.65 in first-quarter 2018.Solid financial results have been one of the reasons for the company’s stock price rally of 4.6% in the last three months. This return comfortably outperformed 1.8% decline recorded by the industry and 1.2% fall in the Zacks Basic Materials sector.Also, in the last 60 days, the company’s earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have been increased by seven and five brokerage firms, respectively. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.76 for 2018 and $7.36 for 2019, representing growth of 1.8% and 2.2% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Favorable Operating Conditions: We believe that strengthening U.S. economy — evident from healthy growth in GDP, rise in industrial production, improving housing market, increasing job additions and many more — as well as healthy growth prospects of the global economy, will spur demand for industrial gases.Also, growing applications of industrial gases — especially that of hydrogen in the refining industry, oxygen in healthcare, and nitrogen and carbon dioxide in oil and gas industry — has been beneficial for Praxair. Moreover, gas-supply contracts with Samsung, Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) and many more, as well as solid backlog of $1.5 billion while exiting the first quarter of 2018, underpin preferences for the company’s products.Dividend Payments: Praxair is an ardent believer of rewarding shareholders handsomely, especially through dividend payments. Over the last five years, its annual dividend rate has increased 31.3% from $2.40 per share in 2013 to $3.15 in 2017. After the 5% hike in quarterly dividend rate announced in January 2018, the company’s annual dividend rate stands at $3.30. Also, the company’s dividend payout rate has grown from 40.5% in 2013 to 53.8% in 2017.Solid Growth Prospects in the Near and Long Term: Strengthening end markets, sound product portfolio, rise in global industrial production and project wins are few factors that will drive Praxair’s growth in the quarters ahead. The company anticipates earnings of $1.67-$1.72 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The projection reflects year-over-year growth of 14-18% and includes 5 cents gain from the recent tax reform in the country.Moreover, in the next three to four years, the company anticipates delivering annual earnings growth of 3%, on the back of solid backlog and potential growth opportunities.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the industry are Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

162,FMC,"Perhaps no company in the world polarizes investors and analysts as much as Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report). Led by the enigmatic Elon Musk, Tesla is a dominant force in the budding electric car market—but the company’s history of missing production targets produces questions about the stock’s sky-high valuation.One thing that nearly everyone can agree on is Tesla’s status as an innovator in the automotive industry. Tesla vehicles have some of the longest ranges among consumer electric cars, its “Autopilot” feature was one of the first self-driving platforms to reach the public, and management’s focus on leading the world into the future is commendable.Naturally, Tesla’s prowess has attracted many admirers. And one of the coolest parts about being an investor is that if you truly believe in the structure and vision of a publicly-traded company, you are free to buy up some of that company’s stock and secure yourself a piece of the expansion that you think will come.Wall Street has largely proven to be a believer in Tesla, and despite what some might label as hiccups in the company’s growth plan, the stock has soared more than 800% over the best five years—with plenty of investors still confident that the company is only at the beginning of its rise.If you find yourself in the crowd of investors that think there is plenty more to come from Tesla over the next few years, you might even want to add more exposure to the company’s future to your portfolio right now. Buying more TSLA is always an option, but let’s look at a few other stocks to consider if you are bullish on Tesla.Lithium PlaysIf you are confident in Tesla, that means you are likely a believer in the long-term health of the global lithium market. Tesla and its competitors power their revolutionary electric vehicles with lithium-ion batteries, and rising demand for these batteries should naturally lead to an uptick in lithium mining and production.The obvious first choice here is Albemarle Corp. (ALB  -  Free Report), the world’s largest lithium producer. Albemarle is based in the U.S. and is said to control about 35% of the world’s lithium market. Another option that lithium bulls have targeted is FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report), a diversified machinery and chemicals company that is rapidly expanding its lithium capacity (also read: Beyond Tesla: 2 Lithium Stocks to Buy Now).Suppliers and PartnersTesla famously owns and operates a large portion of its supply chain, but investors have a few options for cashing in on the company’s direct business relationships. For example, Modine Manufacturing Company (MOD  -  Free Report) is a manufacturer of heat transfer equipment and has been said to be a key supplier of battery cooling units for the Model S.To what extent Modine Manufacturing fits into Tesla’s future plans is unknown, but the Model S is still a key model for the company, and Modine is a recognized expert in the heat transfer business. MOD is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another stock currently holding a strong-buy ranking and doing business with Tesla is Wall Street darling Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). This red-hot graphics chip maker made its name in the PC gaming market but is now poised to be a top supplier for the next generation of smart vehicles.Tesla and Nvidia have been partners since the early development of the Model S, and now all Tesla vehicles are equipped with Nvidia-powered supercomputers that run on the chipmaker’s Drive PX computing platform.But no one company is as invested in Tesla’s future as Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY  -  Free Report). The Japanese tech giant agreed to shell out up to $1.6 billion to help build Tesla’s Gigafactory, where it will serve as the car company’s official partner in battery production.“If Tesla succeeds and the electric vehicle becomes mainstream, the world will be changed and we will have lots of opportunity to grow,” Panasonic’s Kazuhiro Tsuga said at the time of the deal (also read: So, What Actually Is Tesla's Gigafactory?).Longshot Gigafactory PlayBesides Panasonic, investors looking to bet on the growth of Tesla’s Gigafactory should consider Monarch Casino & Resort Inc. (MCRI  -  Free Report). This play might be considered a bit of a gamble (pun intended), but Monarch’s main property is the Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno, Nevada. Reno sits just outside of Sparks, Nevada, the home of the Gigafactory—and many MCRI investors are hoping the casino will benefit from economic growth in the area.Bottom LineAt today’s valuations, some might consider simply buying Tesla shares a risk. But others consider the stock cheap considering its future potential. For those that lean towards the latter, the above-mentioned stocks are few diversified ways to get even more exposure to Tesla over the coming years.Want more market analysis from this author?

164,FMC,"A successful investor understands the importance of exiting certain underperformers at the right time to maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) is one such stock that you may want to consider dropping given its significant price decline year to date along with the earnings estimate revisions going downhill for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms Arconic’s weak position in the market.Shares of Arconic have lost around 31.6% year to date. The company has also underperformed its industry’s decline of roughly 6.6%.  Let’s explore the aspects that are responsible for the downslide faced by this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.Tariff Challenges:The company faces pricing pressure due to imposition of tariff on aluminium imports leading to higher input costs. According to the company, aluminum prices have shot up driven by LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting. It is adversely affecting Arconic's operating margins. Although the duration of the tariff effect is unknown, it is expected to end eventually.Aluminum prices also rose 20% in the most recent quarter hurting operating margin by $37 million. The prices are rising sharply in the wake of aluminum tariffs and Russian sanctions. The company expects to face an unfavorable impact of $45-$55 million from elevated aluminum prices in second-quarter 2018. It also currently sees an unfavorable impact of $100 million in 2018. Arconic has reduced its earnings guidance for 2018 factoring in headwinds from higher aluminum prices.Market Instability:Arconic is exposed to softness across certain end-use markets. The company is seeing lower sales in industrial gas turbine market due to weak market conditions. The heavy-duty truck and trailer market in North America, although recovered somewhat of late, remains affected by lower build rates. Arconic is also seeing softness in the packaging market. It is ramping down production at its Tennessee packaging business and plans to exit that business in 2018. The company expects its industrial markets to be flat in 2018.Leverage Concerns:The company is concerned about the high leverage. The company is carrying essentially all of Alcoa Corporation’s (AA  -  Free Report) debt, following the business separation. While the company is taking actions to cut debt, it still has substantial long-term debt of roughly $6.3 billion as against cash and cash equivalents of roughly $1.2 billion.Downward Estimate RevisionFor the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This has caused the consensus estimate, going from $1.49 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.24. The downward trend in earnings estimate revisions indicate that the odds in favor of an upside in the near term are slim.For the current quarter, Arconic has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate for earnings down to 30 cents a share from 40 cents over the past 30 days.  Other Bearish ReadingsReturn on Capital (ROC) of Arconic is 5.1% compared with 7.8% for the industry. Arconic’s trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock’s current ROE stands at 11.4% compared with the industry’s ROE of 16.6%.The debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Arconic seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 54.4% compared with 47.1% for the industry.Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of D, which dampens its appeal. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus Arconic Inc.

166,FMC,"CVR Partners, LP (UAN  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results, ahead of the bell on Apr 26. The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 71.4% in fourth-quarter 2017. CVR Partners reported a loss of $27.4 million or 24 cents per share, higher than a loss of $14.5 million or 13 cents it logged a year ago. The reported loss per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. The company raked in net sales of $78.2 million in the quarter, down around 8% year over year.  The company’s results in the quarter were affected by unscheduled downtime at the East Dubuque fertilizer facility and a few maintenance days on the urea ammonium nitrate (UAN  -  Free Report) plant at Coffeyville. Reduced ammonia and UAN sales prices also affected the results. CVR Partners missed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 144.1%. CVR Partners’ shares have declined around 36.5% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 22.9% gain.    Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider CVR Partners is exposed to pricing pressure stemming from lower nitrogen fertilizer prices, as witnessed in the last reported quarter. UAN prices fell by a roughly 10% in fourth-quarter 2017. Urea prices have been under pressure due to excess nitrogen supply. Ammonia prices also slipped around 25% in the last quarter.  However, CVR Partners, during its fourth-quarter call, said that it has been witnessing lower nitrogen product imports, steady customer demand and higher prices for nitrogen. The company also noted that most industry participants are expecting around 90 million corn acres to be planted for the spring season. Meanwhile, the company remains committed to ramp up its UAN production capacity. It should also benefit from the Rentech acquisition and healthy demand for nitrogen. With the buyout of Rentech Nitrogen Partners, the company has been able to create an entity with larger scale, enhance production capacity and increase operating reach. The combined company is now the second-biggest producer of UAN in North America.  CVR Partners, LP Price and EPS Surprise  CVR Partners, LP Price and EPS Surprise | CVR Partners, LP Quote Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not show that CVR Partners is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

168,FMC,"Gold miner Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, Newmont has surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.5%.Moreover, revenues for the fourth quarter went up around 8.2% year over year to $1,935 million, but trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,957.6 million.Can the company surprise investors this quarter or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderNewmont expects attributable gold production in the range of 4.9-5.4 million ounces for 2018, primarily driven by factors including full potential mine plan, recovery and throughput improvements. Newmont's attributable gold production increased roughly 1% year over year to 1.34 million ounces in the fourth quarter on the back of a full quarter of production at Long Canyon, higher throughput and grade at Merian and Tanami, which offset lower grade at Boddington, harder ore at Akyem and lower grade and recovery at CC&V.The company’s all-in sustaining costs (AISC) guidance for 2018 is between $965 and $1,025 per ounce, as increases in exploration and advanced projects spending is offset by improved cost applicable to sales (CAS).Total revenues for the first quarter are projected to decrease roughly 4.5% sequentially, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at $1,847 million. Notably, the projected figure marks a 11.3% year-over-year increase from $1,659 million recorded a year ago.Strong production performance (driven by sustained project investments) in the company’s Americas operations is expected to continue in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2017, North America’s attributable gold production rose 1% year over year while gold CAS remained almost flat at $720 per ounce. The company expects North American operations to produce 2.0-2.2 million ounces for 2018.  Attributable gold production in South America went up 13% year over year in the last reported quarter while gold CAS fell 9% to $577 per ounce. The company expects the region to produce 615,000-675,000 ounces this year on the back of mill productivity improvements, which partly offsets recoveries from deep transitional ore and Yanacocha’s lower production resulting from lower grades.Attributable gold and copper production in the Australia went up around 3% year over year in the fourth quarter. Newmont expects Australia production between 1.5 and 1.7 million ounces in 2018 as higher grade, recovery and throughput improvements at Tanami and KCGM are likely to offset increased stripping at Boddington.Attributable gold production from Africa went down by down 9% year over year in the fourth quarter and CAS decreased 2% to $755 per ounce. The company expects Africa production between 815,000 and 875,000 ounces this year.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects as it continues to invest in growth projects in a calculated manner, including Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa and Twin Underground in North America.In fourth-quarter 2017, Newmont successfully started commercial production at its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. Moreover, the Long Canyon mine in Nevada and Merian gold mine in Suriname have also reached commercial production.However, Newmont faces headwinds from high production costs in 2018. The company’s projected AISC for 2018 is higher than $924 recorded for full-year 2017. Newmont’s AISC rose 5% year over year to $968 in the fourth quarter, mainly due to higher per unit CAS, higher exploration costs and increased sustaining capital. Increased project spending is expected to keep AISC at elevated levels.Shares of Newmont have lost 0.5% in the past three months, outperforming the 9.5% decline recorded by its industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Newmont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

170,FMC,"Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, before the market opens on Apr 24. The company recorded adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents. Revenues for the quarter rose 14% year over year to $910 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $904.5 million. Alleghany outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 41.7%. Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Quote Factors at Play Allegheny expects continued operating margin improvement and revenue growth in its High Performance Metals and Components (HPMC) unit in 2018 resulting from improved asset utilization and ongoing aerospace market demand growth. Allegheny also expects its Flat-Rolled Products (FRP) unit to build on the operational improvements and product mix benefits attained last year and improve operating margins. However, the company expects first-quarter 2018 results to be unfavorably impacted by roughly $10 million, on a sequential basis, owing to reduced ferrochrome surcharges and required accounting changes on retirement benefit cost capitalization in inventory. The company sees the production ramp-up of the proposed joint venture with Tsingshan Stainless to benefit FRP results in second-half 2018. For the first quarter, Allegheny’s revenues are expected to be $932.6 million, reflecting an estimated year-over-year growth of 7.7%. Last month, Allegheny and Tsingshan Group formed their previously announced 50-50 JV deal to produce 60-inch wide stainless sheet products for the North American market. The JV will be a 50-50 equity investment with the partners sharing its cash flows and operating profit. Moreover, all necessary regulatory and anti-trust clearances for the JV have been received on time and initial customer shipments are expected in the first half of 2018. The JV will offer cost competitive stainless sheet products made for the North American market through a unique combination of Allegheny’s innovative, low-cost Hot Rolling and Processing Facility (“HRPF”) and Tsingshan’s unparalleled Indonesian refining, mining and castings assets, and the JV’s unique Direct Roll Anneal and Pickle facility in Midland, PA. The JV supports Allegheny’s considerable investment in the U.S. manufacturing operations, especially its HRPF facility, which will provide value addition to the processing services for the JV’s finished products. Per the company, this move will also benefit its FRP unit that employs more than 2,000 people in the United States. Moreover, the JV will lay foundations for the company’s long-term objectives and additionally support job creation in the United States by directly creating roughly 100 manufacturing jobs in Western Pennsylvania. Allegheny’s shares have soared 53.8% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 40% gain.   Earnings WhisperOur proven model conclusively shows that Allegheny is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Allegheny has an Earnings ESP of +9.38%.

It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,941.2 million. Sales were driven by increased paint sales volumes in the Americas Group unit and the Valspar acquisition.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missed twice, delivering an average positive surprise of around 0.8%.Shares of Sherwin-Williams have moved up 22.1% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 19% gain. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySherwin-Williams, in its fourth-quarter 2017 call, said that it sees mid-to-high single digit percentage increase in net sales year over year for first-quarter 2018.

At this level, the company expects earnings per share for the year to be in the range of $15.35 to $15.85 per share, compared with $18.67 earned in 2017. The guidance includes around $3.45 per share charge related to the Valspar acquisition.The Valspar acquisition has enabled Sherwin-Williams to strengthen its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally, leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies. Sherwin-Williams should gain from significant synergies of the acquisition. The company expects to achieve $320 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated net sales for Sherwin-Williams for the first quarter is $3,984 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of around 44.3%.Net sales from the Americas Group segment for the first quarter is projected to decrease roughly 4.1% from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $2,100 million.Net sales from the Consumer Brands Group segment for the first quarter is projected to increase roughly 14.2% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $653 million.Net sales from the Performance Coatings Group segment for the first quarter is projected to decrease roughly 2.3% from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $1,190 million.Sherwin-Williams’ cost control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement should yield margin benefits. Working capital management and efforts to cut operating costs are also helping the company to generate healthy cash flows. Moreover, addition of Valspar-related sales should continue to support the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company faces headwinds from higher raw materials costs. Sherwin-Williams is witnessing inflation across several raw material categories including titanium dioxide (TiO2) and propylene this year. The company expects higher year over year input costs in first-half 2018 and projects average inflation to be in the 4% to 6% band for this year.

Segment earnings were $356 million, up 250% year over year.Revenues from the Lithium unit surged 57% year over year to $103 million. Segment earnings nearly doubled to $50 million. Higher year-over-year prices on all product categories, higher volume from debottlenecking projects in Argentina, lower operating costs and hydroxide expansion in China were the major contributors to growth.Balance SheetFMC ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $359.7 million, a 27.1% year-over-year rise.Long-term debt was almost flat year over year at $2,993.2 million.OutlookFor 2018, FMC increased adjusted earnings expectations to the band of $5.90 to $6.20 per share (up from $5.20 to $5.60 expected earlier).For second-quarter 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share.

There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter.VGM ScoresAt this time, FMC has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise FMC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

Healthy olefin and polyolefin market demand is supporting strong global operating rates. With no major maintenance schedule, the company expects to deliver robust performance from its global assets.  Revenues for LyondellBasell’s Intermediates and Derivatives segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a 1.2% decline from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1,990 million.  LyondellBasell’s Olefins & Polyolefins – Americas segment revenues are expected to inch up 0.9% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $2,571 million. Olefins & Polyolefins – Europe, Asia, International division is expected to witness a 4.3% fall in revenues as the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $2,879 million for the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Refining segment is expected to be $1,644 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 4% decline on a sequential basis. The Technology segment’s sales are expected to rise 1.9% sequentially in the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $109 million. LyondellBasell is well-placed to deliver strong volume growth during the second half of 2017. The company is executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. LyondellBasell's ethylene expansion initiatives should boost capacity and add to its earnings. It also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging healthy cash flows. However, LyondellBasell is exposed to volatility in raw material and energy costs that account for a major portion of its operating costs. The low oil price environment remains a headwind for the company.  LyondellBasell Industries NV Price and EPS Surprise  LyondellBasell Industries NV Price and EPS Surprise | LyondellBasell Industries NV QuoteEarnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that LyondellBasell is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for LyondellBasell is currently pegged at -0.98%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.42 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.44. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: LyondellBasell currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Though a Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks With Favorable Combination Here are some companies in the chemical space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cabot Corp. for the fiscal first quarter is +3.21%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 81 cents and 78 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot Corp. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderIn November 2017, Cabot Corp. stated that moving forward to fiscal 2018, it remains focused on its growth strategy in core activities, driving application innovation with customers and generating robust cash flows through optimization and efficiency. Cabot Corp. is also optimistic about the current business environment and expects to witness growth across all segments.The company will also be speeding up its growth investments in the Carrollton and Wuhai projects, which is expected to drive future profitability. Overall, Cabot Corp. will continue to focus on creating shareholder value by generating strong discretionary free cash flow and reinvesting in core business activities along with returning cash to shareholders.Cabot Corp.’s revenues for the fiscal first quarter is projected to rise 5.4% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at $644 million.Revenues in the Reinforcement Materials segment increased 27% year over year in the last reported quarter while the EBIT went up 14.3% year over year, mainly supported by an improved demand environment in China and higher volumes and unit margins from calendar year 2017 customer contracts.  Sales for the Performance Chemicals rose almost 15% year over year in the last quarter. EBIT declined 5.2% year over year, mainly due to higher fixed costs and lower unit margins from the impact of higher feedstock costs, which were partly offset by strong volume growth.Sales of both Purification Solutions and Specialty Fluids declined year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. While the EBIT of Purification Solutions segment remained mostly flat year over year, results in the quarter benefited from higher volumes in the Specialty applications along with the favorable impact from changes in inventory levels. EBIT of the Specialty Fluids segment fell year over year due to decreased project activity in Asia and the North Sea.   In October 2017, Cabot Corp. indefinitely idled three of the seven units at its activated carbon manufacturing facility in Marshall, TX. The move not only enables the company to realign its costs to current demand and pricing levels but also adapt to present market conditions in North America.Moreover, Cabot Corp. inked a deal in late October last year to purchase one of North America’s leading producers of black masterbatches (also known as concentrates), Tech Blend, for roughly $64 million. The move extends Cabot’s global footprint in black masterbatch and compounds and also allows to grow in conductive formulations.Cabot Corp.’s shares have moved up 7% over the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 5.4% growth. Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +18.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

184,FMC,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V.’s (LYB  -  Free Report) consistent focus on HDPE project and the proposed buyout of A. Schulman bode well for the company. Evidently, it registered a year-over-year gain in top line over the past few quarters, courtesy of these strategic initiatives.In the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 12.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%. Yet, maintenance outages and raw material pricing pressure raise concerns. Let’s delve deeper.Key CatalystLyondellBasell remains on track with the construction of an HDPE plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast that will employ its proprietary Hyperzone PE technology. Also, it is constructing a world scale plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast for producing propylene oxide (PO) and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). The plant will have annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of PO and 2.2 billion pounds of TBA and its derivatives. A major part of the company’s growth investment for 2018 (roughly 55% of total capital spending of $2.4 billion) will be allocated to these projects.LyondellBasell’s expected buyout of A. Schulman for $2.25 billion will create a premier global provider of advanced polymer solutions with extensive geographic reach, leading technologies and a diverse product portfolio. A. Schulman is a leading supplier of high-performance plastic compounds, composites and powders. The deal will double the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business and create a platform for future growth, with reach into additional high-growth markets such as packaging and consumer products, electronics and appliances, building and construction and agriculture. LyondellBasell expects to realize cost synergies of $150 million within two years. The buyout is also expected to be accretive to earnings within the first full year, following its closure.LyondellBasell remains committed to deliver greater value to its shareholders leveraging healthy cash flows. It bought back 10 million shares in 2017, returning $866 million to its shareholders. LyondellBasell also recently raised its quarterly dividend by 11%. It generated operating cash flows of more than $1 billion in the most recently reported quarter.ConcernsOf late, interruptions, including maintenance outages, have been hurting the company’s  production capacity and results. First-quarter 2018 results were affected by loss in production due to a planned maintenance on one of its two crackers at the Channelview facility. The company incurred a loss of around $50 million and expects another $50 million impact in the second quarter.The company is hurt by weak ethylene prices that continue to weigh on its U.S. olefin margins. Strong industry supply and higher inventory have led to weak ethylene pricing environment over the past few months.LyondellBasell is facing headwinds related to volatility in raw material and energy costs that account for a major portion of its operating costs. Higher feedstock and energy costs led to a 15% year-over-year increase in its cost of sales in the last-reported quarter. The company saw a rise in propylene feedstock costs in the quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLyondellBasell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked companies in the basic materials space are FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report), Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) and The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report).

Moreover, it is benefiting from the investments made last year to improve its operations and reliability.Westlake Chemical is gaining from contributions of Axiall acquisition, increased demand and higher selling prices for major products.

189,FMC,"U.S. chemical production increased in November as the industry continued to recover from the damaging effects of hurricanes – according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council (""ACC"").The chemical industry trade group said that the U.S. Chemical Production Regional Index (""CPRI"") went up 1.2% in November on a monthly comparison basis. This follows a 0.5% rise a month ago and a 1.2% decline in September. The U.S. CPRI, which is measured using a three-month moving average, was created to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide.Per the ACC, chemical production rose across all regions in the reported month. The increase reflects sustained recovery from the unfavorable impacts of disruptions from hurricanes and a rebound in manufacturing activity.Hurricane Harvey weighed on U.S. chemical production during the third quarter. A sizable portion of total U.S. production capacity was hit by the storm. Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the Gulf Coast – the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry. A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production, leading to reduced supply of this major chemical in the third quarter.Encouraging November ReadingsThe November readings showed a rise in chemical output across the board. Production across Gulf Coast, Midwest and Ohio Valley went up 2.2%, 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively, while both Mid-Atlantic and Northeast saw a 0.9% increase. Output rose 0.8% in West Coast while Southeast saw a 1.4% gain.By segments, chemical production was mixed in November. Gains across pesticides, fertilizers, coatings, adhesives, organic chemicals, other specialty chemicals, synthetic rubber, consumer products and pharmaceuticals were neutralized by lower production in industrial gases, manufactured fibers, dyes and pigments, plastic resins and chlor-alkali.Per the ACC, activity for the U.S. manufacturing sector – the largest consumer of chemical products – rose 0.6% in November. The sector is a major driver for the chemical industry which touches around 96% of manufactured goods.Overall chemical production also went up 2.4% on a year over year basis in November with all regions scoring gains.U.S. Chemical Industry Set to Ride Growth WaveThe U.S. Chemical Industry is set for solid growth in 2018. The ACC envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018, further accelerating to a 3.9% growth in 2019. The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and improved export markets.The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4.7% in 2018 and further gain steam with a 5.2% rise in 2019 on the heels of new capacity additions. Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are expected to play a significant role in production growth.The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy. This is driving investment in chemical production projects.Per the ACC, roughly 320 chemical projects have been already announced worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment. Moreover, roughly 65% of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction. New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.The ACC also expects chemical industry capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Moreover, the ACC sees improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.  Chemical Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks that are worth considering in the chemicals space are Kronos Worldwide, Inc.

QuoteFactors to ConsiderFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Air Products anticipates adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.65-$1.70 per share, which at midpoint, also represents a 12% increase over last year.Revenues for Air Products’ Industrial Gases — America segment for the fourth quarter is projected to witness a 0.1% rise from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $931 million. Operating income is also expected to increase 1.7% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $240 million for the fourth quarter.Air Products’ Industrial Gases — Asia segment revenues are expected to decline 7.4% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $498 million.

Operating profit increased to $61.7 million from $47 million in the prior-year quarter. The segment’s profit reflects higher productivity from increasing aerospace and defense sales, an improved product mix of next-generation nickel alloys and forgings for the aero engine market and benefits of the 2016 titanium operation-restructuring activities.The Flat-Rolled Products (FRP) segment’s sales rose 15% year over year to $356.2 million on the back of higher shipment volume for both high-value and standard stainless products and modestly higher selling prices of standard stainless and Precision Rolled Strip products. The segment’s operating loss came in at $7.3 million compared with the year-ago quarter loss of $20.8 million. Results were adversely impacted by a sharp decline in raw material prices, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher operating levels and the benefits of cost reductions and restructuring actions.Financial PositionAllegheny’s cash in hand as of Sep 30, 2017 was $124.9 million, down 33.7% year over year.

200,FMC,"Industrial gas producer and supplier Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In each of the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results. Average earnings surprise was a positive 1.46%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.46 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.10%.In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 14.2% return, outperforming the gain of 11.9% recorded by the industry. Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement. What’s Affecting Q3 Results?Praxair sources more than 60% of revenues from its North and South American operations. This has made the company’s financials highly susceptible to economic or political uncertainties in these regions. For the second half of 2017, the company believes that customer demand in the United States will be below expectations while economic conditions in South America will continue to suffer from political tensions. Europe will likely remain stable.Adding to the concerns is the adverse impact of the hurricanes in the United States on the demand of Praxair’s industrial gases. Also, the company faces headwinds from adverse movement in foreign currencies, geopolitical issues, rise in production costs and industry competition.Moreover, Praxair’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 58.5% in second-quarter 2017. We believe, if unchecked, higher debt levels might increase the company’s financial obligations and hence, prove detrimental to its profitability. Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

Its adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share for the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents. Newmont has surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 14.4%.Shares of Newmont have moved up 11.5% in the past three months, outperforming the 5.1% growth recorded by its industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayNewmont, in July, revised its guidance of attributable gold production to the range of 5-5.4 million ounces for 2017 (up from 4.9-5.4 million ounces), as production at Long Canyon and Merian is expected to compensate the impact of declines at Yanacocha and Twin Creeks. However, the company kept attributable copper production forecast for 2017 unchanged from the previous guidance of 40,000-60,000 tons per year.Newmont also revised its AISC (all-in sustaining costs) guidance for 2017 and now expects it to be between $900 and $950 per ounce (down from $940 and $1,000 per ounce expected earlier).  In second-quarter 2017, Newmont's attributable gold production increased 13% year over year to 1.4 million ounces. The increase was due to production from Long Canyon and Merian, offsetting lower grades at Yanacocha and Tanami.Moreover, attributable gold production for North America, South America and Africa increased year over year while the same declined for Australia.Newmont is making notable progress with its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. Tanami expansion project achieved commercial production in August. The Ahafo expansion projects represents additional upside.Moreover, the acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor (“CC&V”) represents a significant opportunity.  The company expects gold production from CC&V to be between 420,000 ounces and 470,000 ounces in 2017, at AISC in the range of $680-$730.Newmont is also making notable progress with its cost and efficiency improvement initiatives, which should lend support to its third quarter results.

The company sees roughly $5 million in increased costs of these raw materials in the third quarter. The company is also seeing high power costs.However, Century Aluminum is implementing a number of actions to reduce costs and preserve cash amid a weak operating environment.

207,FMC,"The automotive industry is currently undergoing radical transformation. Strict emission standards and the proposals made by a few Asian and European countries to prohibit internal combustion engines driven by fossil fuels, has prompted a number of traditional automakers across the globe to gear up for electric vehicles (EVs). The present market share of EVs is paltry. Irrespective of that, automakers across the globe are pumping huge amount of money with expectations of EVs soon becoming cheap as conventional cars. In fact, per a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, EVs will account for 54% of new car sales by 2040.The report also mentions that by 2025-29, in most countries EVs will be cheaper than internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. It further predicts that by 2030, the price of lithium-ion battery will plunge more than 70% and that “the real take-off for EVs will happen in the second half of the 2020s.”Rally to EV TrackAt the forefront of the revolution is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report). Its shares have skyrocketed around 879% over the past five years. Led by CEO Elon Musk, Tesla has been instrumental in the transition to electric and renewable and sustainable energy.Other automakers are following suit. Recently, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Volvo Ab (VLVLY  -  Free Report) shared plans of aggressively investing in huge fleets of electric models. Only a couple of days ago, Japanese auto giant, Toyota Motor Corp.

Barely a day ago, German automaker, Volkswagen AG’s (VLKAY  -  Free Report), unit, Electrify America, disclosed its intentions of installing 2,800 electric vehicle charging stations in 17 of the largest U.S. cities by June 2019.Beneficiaries of EV BoomAlthough, all automakers will eventually have to join the EV race in the future, a few have already taken some serious steps toward this goal. In fact, from automotive manufacturers to chip makers to battery manufacturers, there are different types of companies which are likely to gain from this EV boom.According to a report by Global Equity and Credit Research, over the next five years, demand for EVs and electric storage systems (ESS) is anticipated to grow at an annual compound rate of 20% and 10%, respectively. Lithium, aluminum, cobalt, graphite, nickel and copper are most likely to gain from this rising demand for batteries.Stocks to ConsiderWe now zero in on five stocks, not only from the auto sector but also from other sectors, which are likely to gain from this optimism. We pick stocks with a market cap of more than $1 billion and a Zacks Rank of 1 or 2.Japanese automaker Toyota is taking big strides on the EV front.

The company now sees adjusted earnings in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share for 2017, up from its prior view of $3.10 to $3.30 per share. The revision is partly due to lower than expected effective tax rate.The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast for 2017 to around $195 million from roughly $185 million expected earlier. The guidance also reflects an increase from $174 million recorded in the prior year.Koppers should gain from sustained strong performance of its Carbon Materials and Chemicals (CMC) and Performance Chemicals (PC) units. The CMC unit is benefiting from favorable market conditions and savings benefits from the company’s restructuring actions.While the PC division faces headwinds from raw material cost inflation, it is likely to gain from continued strong demand.

210,FMC,"Lithium stocks are firing on all cylinders, thanks to rising demand for lithium-ion batteries that are used to power electric cars. These rechargeable batteries are used by several auto makers, including Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Navistar International Corporation (NAV  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report). They also have applications in consumer electronics (including smartphones and tablets), industrial as well as in the aerospace and defense sector.The market for lithium-ion batteries has a lot of untapped potential. Demand for these batteries are expected to go up with their increasing adoption in consumer electronic products as well as efforts to promote the use of electric cars by several governments to curb pollution.China is reportedly considering an eventual ban on production and sales of cars that run on diesel or gasoline. The move is part of Beijing’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions and pollution and is also aimed at promoting the development of electric and hybrid vehicles.The global market for lithium-ion batteries for vehicles is expected to grow to $30.6 billion in 2024 from $7.8 billion in 2015, according to a report by Navigant Research. Navigant envisions the growth in electric vehicle batteries to be fuelled by premium, long-range vehicles and more affordable vehicles with improved driving ranges.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two prominent lithium players – Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) and FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) – to figure out which stock is more attractive.Albemarle, sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is seeing significant momentum in its lithium business and is well placed to leverage strong expected growth in the battery-grade lithium market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The buyout of the lithium assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co. Ltd. has allowed Albemarle to supply premium lithium salts to an expanded global customer base and accelerated the company’s ability to meet its goal of capturing 50% of the growth in the lithium industry.Albemarle is executing a number of projects that are likely to boost its global lithium derivative capacity to 165,000 metric tons by 2021. Albemarle’s Talison joint venture in Australia is expanding lithium concentrate production at its Greenbushes mine.Moreover, Albemarle, in September, said that it has developed a novel technology that would allow it to increase annual lithium production in Chile on a sustainable basis to as much as 125,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent without requiring additional brine pumping at its facility in the Salar de Atacama. The move is part of the company’s efforts to beef up efficiencies and sustainability of its Atacama operations.On the other hand, FMC Corp., a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is seeing strong demand in its Lithium unit and is expanding production capacity to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles. The company is expanding its lithium hydroxide production capacity. It is executing this expansion in three phases.FMC Corp. has executed its Phase I lithium hydroxide expansion on time and budget, achieving 9,000 metric tons of production run rate in September 2017. The Phase 2 expansion is expected to add another 12,000 metric tons of capacity. The company expects its lithium business to deliver strong earnings growth in 2017.Let's take a closer look at how Albemarle and FMC Corp. are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.Price PerformanceAlbemarle’s shares have gained 63% over a year while FMC Corp. has rallied 70.8% over the same period. While both stocks have outperformed the industry they belong to over the same period, FMC Corp. clearly scores above Albemarle. Leverage & LiquidityAlbemarle has a lower leverage as evident by its debt to equity ratio of 0.35 compared with FMC Corp.’s debt to equity ratio of 0.70.However, in terms of liquidity (as determined by the current ratio), FMC Corp. holds an edge over Albemarle. The current ratio for FMC Corp. is 2.19 compared with 2.11 for Albemarle.ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, Albemarle looks cheaper compared with FMC Corp.In case of FMC Corp., the trailing 12-months EV/EBITDA ratio is 24.3, which is above its own average of 18.3 in the past one year and also nearly the high level of 24.7 it scaled over that period. On the other hand, Albemarle is cheaper with a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.5.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Albemarle and FMC Corp. is 11.6% and 16.8%, respectively. While both stocks have scored above the industry’s level of 11.2%, FMC Corp. holds an edge here.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, the dividend yield for Albemarle has been higher than FMC Corp. While Albemarle offered a dividend yield of 0.9%, FMC Corp. had a yield of 0.7%.Earnings Surprise HistoryTaking a look at both the companies surprise history, Albemarle has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. On the other hand, FMC Corp. has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters while missed twice, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 2.8%.Growth ExpectationsThe expected earnings per share growth rate for Albemarle for the current year currently stands at 24.5% compared with an expected decline of 6% for FMC Corp. Also, Albemarle has an expected long-term earnings growth of 14.8%, higher than FMC Corp.’s 11.3%. As such, Albemarle is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectations.In ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that FMC Corp. holds an edge over Albemarle in terms of price performance, liquidity and ROE measures. However, when considering leverage, earnings surprise history, valuation, dividend yield and earnings growth projections, Albemarle seems to be the preferred stock. As the scale is tipped in favor of Albemarle, it is clearly a better lithium play compared to FMC Corp.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

211,FMC,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 25.Last quarter, the mining company reported a negative earnings surprise of 15%. Freeport missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 20.1%.Freeport’s shares have moved up 14.4% in the last three months, underperforming the 16.6% growth recorded by its industry.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFreeport, in July, cut its sales volume expectations for 2017. The company now sees sales volumes to be roughly 3.7 billion pounds of copper (down from 3.9 billion pounds expected earlier), 1.6 million ounces of gold (down from 1.9 million ounces expected earlier) and 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 940 million pounds of copper, 375,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in third-quarter 2017.The company assumes average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold, $2.65 per pound of copper and $7.50 per pound of molybdenum for the remainder of 2017.The company’s consolidated copper sales volumes in the second quarter were lower than its expectations reflecting the impact of worker absenteeism on mining and milling rates in Indonesia. However, gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia. Copper sales from Freeport’s North American Copper Mines for the third quarter is projected to witness a 13.5% decrease from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 353 million pounds. The segment’s sales volume also decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.Gold sales from the Indonesia  Mining for the third quarter is projected to decline 11.9% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 376,000 ounces.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for copper sales from the company’s South America Mining is expected to be 315 million pounds for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 8.9% growth on a sequential-comparison basis. The company’s sales were affected in the second quarter due to reduced mining rates, ore grades and recoveries.Freeport is taking actions to cut mining costs and reduce debt. It is also conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity. The company’s copper cash costs declined roughly 10% year over year in the second quarter. Freeport’s cost reduction actions should lend support to its margins in the third quarter.The company is also expected to gain from higher copper prices in the to-be-reported quarter, providing support to its top line. Copper prices have enjoyed a healthy run so far in 2017.However, Freeport has cut its copper and gold sales volume guidance for 2017, partly due to the impact of the suspension of exports in Indonesia. Freeport reduced its Indonesia workforce by 10% and cut investments in the Grasberg underground expansion to make up for the losses suffered due to the halt of export. Nevertheless, Freeport and the government of Indonesia have agreed on a framework that would allow Freeport to keep operating its Grasberg mine.Freeport-McMoran, Inc.

212,FMC,"Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Oct 26.Eastman Chemical saw higher profits in second-quarter 2017, aided by its cost management actions, disciplined capital allocation and growth of high-margin products. Adjusted earnings of $1.98 per share for the quarter topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89.Revenues rose around 5% year over year to $2,419 million in the second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,366 million.Eastman Chemical's stock has gained 32.7% over a year, modestly outperforming the 31.9% gain of the industry it belongs to. Eastman Chemical topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5.8%. Is the company poised for another winning quarter? Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Watch ForEastman Chemical, earlier this month, provided an update on its earnings expectations for full-year 2017, including preliminary expectations of the impact of an operational incident at the company’s Kingsport manufacturing plant.            The company noted that fundamental state of business in the third quarter was strong, which is also expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Additionally, Eastman Chemical expects the financial impact of recent hurricanes in the United States to be neutral, with impacts varying by segment.Given these factors, Eastman Chemical expects adjusted earnings per share growth in 2017 to be toward the top end of the earlier projected range of 10-12% year over year, excluding the financial impact of the Kingsport operational incident.Earlier this month, the company’s Kingsport coal gasification area suffered an operational incident. However, there were no reports of any adverse impact on the environment or on human health. The company noted that all areas of the manufacturing facility are reinstating normalcy with the exception of coal gasification operations.Eastman Chemical is using alternative processes to continue operations of all downstream derivative facilities of coal gasification with repairing works being on track. Though the company is still assessing the financial impact of the incident, it is expected to affect operating earnings in the range of $50-100 million, mostly in fourth-quarter 2017.Eastman Chemical’s high margin products and its aggressive cost management actions are likely to continue to drive its earnings in the third quarter. The company should gain from sustained growth of its high margins specialty products.Eastman Chemical remains focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions. The company is aims to achieve $100 million of cost savings in 2017. Its cost reduction actions are expected to contribute around 50 cents to earnings per share in 2017.Eastman Chemical should also gain from synergies of acquisitions, especially Taminco Corporation. The Taminco acquisition has provided attractive cost and revenue synergy opportunities.However, the company faces challenges in fibers and ethylene pricing. Lower prices of acetate tow are hurting its Fibers unit. Weak tow pricing may continue to weigh on sales in this segment in the third quarter.Moreover, the company expects ethylene prices to be lower in second-half 2017 vis-à-vis the first half. As such, ethylene margins are expected to remain under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Eastman Chemical is also seeing a spike in raw materials costs, especially in its Chemical Intermediates segment. Raw materials costs headwind is expected to persist in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the company’s actions to increase selling prices of its products are expected to help it offset the impact of raw material cost inflation. Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteEarnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Eastman Chemical is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

The decrease was mainly driven by lower production volumes due to operational decisions reflecting availability of quality ore and present market conditions. Revenues per ton were $43.36, up around 1.8% from the prior-year quarter. Cash production cost per ton was $40.54, up around 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Revenues for the quarter rose 8.6% year over year to $880.2 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $876.1 million.Alleghany beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, while missing in one, with an average positive surprise of 11.7%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Allegheny Technologies Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayAlleghany recently provided updates on third-quarter 2017 results. The company announced a non-cash net of tax charge of $114 million, or $1.05 per share, for goodwill impairment related to the Cast Products business.Allegheny anticipates third-quarter results to be in line with its July outlook excluding the impairment charge. A year-over-year improvement in High Performance Materials and Components (HPMC) segment is expected to continue over the next few years, courtesy of the ongoing next-generation aerospace ramp.The company’s Flat Rolled Products segment results are expected to be adversely impacted by a sharp decline in raw material prices, mainly ferrochrome and nickel. This is expected to reduce profit margins due to out-of-phase raw material surcharges, resulting in a loss in this segment.Sales in the third quarter are expected to be in the range of $865-$875 million with a reported loss in the range of $1.11-$1.14 per share, including the $1.05 per share charge for the goodwill impairment. Excluding this charge, the reported loss is expected in the range of 6 cents-9 cents per share.Nevertheless, Allegheny is likely to benefit from its diversified global growth markets as well as cost reduction and restructuring measures. The company is seeing healthy demand from aerospace OEMs which should spur growth.Allegheny expects its HPMC unit to maintain robust performance in the second half of 2017, especially in the commercial aerospace. Further, the company expects the unit to continue to deliver a low-double-digit level of operating margin.Allegheny’s shares moved up 35.4% over a year outperforming the industry’s 28.6% gain.  Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allegheny is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

216,FMC,"While the market for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries has a ton of untapped potential, Tesla Inc.’s (TSLA  -  Free Report) decision to build a $5 billion Gigafactory to meet its requirement of lithium-ion battery packs brought glaring focus on the shortage of supply of this emerging energy storage technology.Li-ion batteries are a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the anode to cathode during discharge, and from cathode to anode when charging. They are a popular choice by electric car manufacturers, and are used by General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), Navistar International (NAV  -  Free Report), BMW AG (BAMXF  -  Free Report), Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report), and Ford (F  -  Free Report), among many others. Li-ion batteries are also used in cellphones, laptops, and other electronic devices, as well as in the aerospace and defense sector.In January 2016, electronics company Panasonic (PCRFY  -  Free Report) agreed to invest up to $1.6 billion in Tesla’s Gigafactory. Kazuhiro Tsuga, President of Panasonic, said that ""We are sort of waiting on the demand from Tesla. If Tesla succeeds and the electric vehicle becomes mainstream, the world will be changed and we will have lots of opportunity to grow.”Initial production at the Gigafactory began at the beginning of this year, and Tesla anticipates annual lithium-ion battery production of the factory to reach around 35 gigawatt-hours, which equals the total global production of 2014.While Tesla expects Gigafactory to reach full capacity by 2020, the manufacturing plant has experienced some production issues. This past quarter, the company blamed the Gigafactory as the “primary constraint” on its Model 3 production line, and its target of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of this year has been pushed back until the end of Q1 2018.Even though Tesla reiterated that there are “no fundamental problems” with its production methods or supply chains, investors should consider other lithium-related companies that are looking good at the moment.Top LIthium PicksOne of the world’s leading producers of machinery and chemicals for the agriculture industry, FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report) is quickly expanding its lithium production capacity. Even though FMC’s lithium business only makes up a small percentage of its total revenue and profits, the company owns its lithium source, the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, and processing and production facilities.FMC is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and shares have gained over 77% in the past year. In its most recent quarter, the company reported an adjusted bottom line beat, with a miss on the top line, and its Lithium segment grew 110% year-over-year thanks. FMC also raised its full-year 2017 adjusted earnings guidance to be in the range of $2.59 and $2.69 per share.Additionally, FMC sits in a strong industry overall. Chemical-Diversified is in the top 28% of all industries on the Zacks Industry Rank, and has returned over 27% year-to-date. The company is not cheap; its forward P/E of 37.57 trades well above the industry average and the S&P 500’s average price-to-earnings. But lithium is a growing industry, and FMC’s current value reflects its potential as a major lithium player.Albemarle Corp. (ALB  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest lithium producer, and Bloomberg estimates its share of the world’s lithium to be about 35%. The U.S.-based company has leading market positions in lithium, bromine, and refining catalysts, and has three independent sources of lithium: Salar de Atacama, Chile; Silver Peak, Nevada; and Talison Lithium joint venture with Tianqi in Western Australia.ALB is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and the stock has shot up more than 172% in the last 12 months. Albermarle reports its next quarterly earnings on Nov. 8, and anticipates year-over-year top and bottom line growth of 12.7% and 17.7%, respectively. The company has beaten analyst estimates in the last four consecutive quarters, boasting an average earnings surprise of about 7%.Like FMC, Albemarle is an expensive stock, with a forward P/E of 32.56; its price-to-earnings sits well above the industry average of 17.25. ALB’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 5.58, while its current PEG ratio is 2.2. Albermarle expects long-term EPS growth over the next three to five years of 14.8%.Bottom LineAs a whole, the lithium industry has blossomed over the last couple of years, and according to Frost & Sullivan, the global market for Li-ion batteries doubled to $22.5 billion in 2016 from $11.7 billion in 2012. Consumer goods and automobile sectors, in large part drove the demand.And, the share of the automobile sector in the Li-ion battery market grew to 25% in 2016 from 14% in 2012, per the data from Frost & Sullivan. This represents a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 37%.As lithium emerges as a vital component in battery supply, in addition in the increasing use of Li-ion batteries in consumer electronic products and efforts to promote the use of electric cars by many governments to curb pollution, the demand for these batteries is expected to rise.For an in-depth discussion on Li-ion batteries and the rise of electric vehicles, make sure to check out Zacks’ free report “Electric Cars: Which Companies Will Surge?” It profiles EV technology, EV manufacturers, and the future of the electric vehicle industry.

220,FMC,"Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.  and Agrium Inc.  said that they have secured regulatory approval in India for their proposed merger of equals.The companies noted that an appellate court in India has cleared a settlement between the merger parties and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and has also directed the CCI to issue a clearance order.The approval of the CCI is conditional on Potash Corp. divesting its minority shareholdings in Arab Potash Company, Israel Chemicals, Ltd. and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. within 18 months from the issue of the order.Both companies have previously obtained unconditional clearance for the merger in Canada, Russia and Brazil.

221,FMC,"The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 24.In the last quarter, the paints and coatings company reported a negative earnings surprise of 0.44% by posting adjusted earnings of $4.52 per share. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54.Sherwin-Williams recorded net sales of $3,735.8 million in the quarter, marking a 16% year-over-year rise. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,571.9 million.Sherwin-Williams beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing in the other two, delivering an average positive surprise of around 3.03%.Shares of Sherwin-Williams have moved up 10.5% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 6.9% growth.  Can Sherwin-Williams surprise investors this earnings or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLast month, Sherwin-Williams provided its revised guidance for third-quarter 2017 after hurricanes affected its stores. The company lowered its profit outlook for the third quarter to reflect the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on its operations in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and neighboring areas as well as disruptions from two earthquakes in Mexico.Sherwin-Williams noted that the hurricanes affected more than 600 stores while 40 locations in the Caribbean still remain closed. Sherwin-Williams operates 706 paint stores across Texas, Florida and the Caribbean and has 145 company-operated stores and 387 dedicated dealers in Mexico.As a result of the aforementioned disruptions, the company envisions third-quarter revenues in its Americas Group unit to be reduced by $50-70 million. It also sees its third quarter sales and profits to be hurt by lost sales days, costs associated with the clean-up and recovery initiatives and tightened supply of certain raw materials.Considering the impacts of hurricanes and earthquakes, Sherwin-Williams now expects its core net sales to rise by a low-single digit clip year over year in the third quarter compared with its earlier view of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.At this expected sales level, the company now expects earnings for the third quarter to be in the band of $3.40-$3.70 per share, down from its earlier view of $3.70-$4.10. The revised outlook includes a $1.10 per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.Notably, the company is expecting the current sales momentum to continue in most geographies, especially in the company-operated stores in the unaffected regions of the United States and Canada. This will allow the company to recover some of the third-quarter earnings shortfall over the remainder of 2017.Sherwin-Williams, in June, closed its acquisition of Valspar, creating a premier global paints and coatings company. The buyout has positioned it as a leading paints and coatings provider globally. However, the company also faces earnings headwinds from sizable charges related to this buyout. It now expects charges related to the Valspar acquisition to be a $2.50 per share for 2017, roughly six times higher than its previous expectation of 40 cents per share.Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Sherwin-Williams Company (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sherwin-Williams is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

These factors are expected to continue to drive the company’s results in the third quarter.Reliance Steel's shares have gained 9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 14.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderReliance Steel, in July, said that it remains carefully optimistic regarding activity levels of business in third-quarter 2017 due to normal seasonal patterns. The company anticipates demand to remain steady except for decline in shipping volume owing to customer vacation and shutdowns schedules in the third quarter. There is also one less shipping day in the third quarter vis-à-vis the second, the company noted.As a result, the company expects tons sold will be down 3% to 5% in third-quarter 2017, compared with the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for shipments for the third quarter are pegged at 1,485,000 tons. This reflects an expected decline of around 3.6% on a sequential comparison basis.Reliance Steel also expects average selling price for the third quarter to be flat to up 3% from the second quarter. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling price per ton sold for the third quarter stands at $1,616, reflecting an expected increase of 1% from $1,600 recorded in the second quarter.The company benefited from higher metals pricing in the second quarter and expects positive momentum in pricing in the third quarter given increases in carbon steel pricing and potential for lower imports.Reliance Steel should also continue to gain from synergies of acquisitions and solid momentum across automotive and aerospace markets in the to-be-reported quarter. Demand in the aerospace market has been supported by higher commercial aerospace build rates. Strong demand is also witnessed in the automotive market, backed by the company’s toll processing businesses in the United States and Mexico as well as increased use of aluminum in the industry.Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.

Protective and marine coatings sales volumes were flat year over year on lower U.S. protective coatings sales volumes stemming from the hurricanes.Industrial Coatings: Sales for the segment were $1.5 billion, up roughly 3% from the prior-year period. Total sales volume rose by more than 3%.Net income for the segment was $223 million, down 10% year over year.

228,FMC,"A couple of chemical companies are gearing up to report their quarterly numbers on Nov 6.  Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Based on the latest Earnings Outlook, 69.8% of the sector participants on the S&P 500 index reported their quarterly numbers as of Nov 1. Earnings for these companies are up 8% from the same period last year on 3.6% higher revenues. Overall third-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to decline 2.3% while revenues are expected to increase 10.7%.The chemical industry has enjoyed a positive run this year, helped by continued strength across major end-use markets such as construction, electronics and automotive. Chemical companies continue to shift their focus to attractive, growth markets. Moreover, they remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth.Strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions are expected to drive the performance of chemical makers in the third quarter. Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Synergies from acquisitions should lend support to earnings in the third quarter.  We take a sneak peek at two chemical companies that are scheduled to report their third-quarter results on Nov 6.FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) will report after the bell. It has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 63 cents. FMC Corp. currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an ESP of 0.00% that makes surprise prediction difficult.

Segment income is expected to increase 15.6% sequentially and 23% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $111 million. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Lithium unit is projected to be $103 million, reflecting a 47.1% rise year over year and a 39.2% increase on a sequential comparison basis. Segment income is also expected to surge 96.6% year over year and 42.3% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $34.4 million.While FMC Corp. is faced with challenging agriculture market fundamentals and pricing headwinds, it is benefiting from its strategic investments, acquisitions and efforts to expand its market position and strengthen its portfolio. Strong momentum in its Lithium unit is also expected to continue to supports results in the to-be-reported quarter. However, weaker prices contributed to lower earnings in the company’s agriculture business in the second quarter and are expected remain a headwind in the third.

The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $483 million.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average negative surprise of 42.7%.Can Cleveland-Cliffs surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayCleveland-Cliffs, in July, cut its profit outlook for 2017. The company now sees net income of roughly $310 million, down from its earlier view of $380 million. It has also cut its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $650 million from $700 million expected earlier.Cleveland-Cliffs, in June 2017, said that it has selected a location in Toledo, OH, for the development of its first HBI production plant. The company has selected Midrex Technologies for design, engineering and procurement of necessary equipment for the new facility, which will produce 1.6 million tons of HBI per year.The new production facility is estimated to require roughly $700 million investment. The company expects the construction to begin by early 2018, and production of commercial tonnage of HBI is expected to initiate in the middle of 2020.The company now expects its full-year selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to be around $110 million, an increase from previous expectations of roughly $100 million to incorporate HBI prefeasibility spending and higher-than-expected incentive compensation accruals.Revenues from product sales and services for Cleveland-Cliffs’ U.S. Iron Ore segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a 5.5% increase from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $497 million. The segment’s sales volume increased in the second quarter mainly due to higher demand. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from product sales and services for the Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment is expected to be $96 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 2% decline on a sequential-comparison basis. The company has also lowered its sales volume guidance for this segment for 2017 owing to termination of certain shipments caused by unfavorable market conditions.    Cleveland-Cliffs is exposed to headwind from lower expected iron ore pricing for the balance of 2017. Rising global supplies (notably from Brazil and China) are expected to put downward pressure on iron ore prices in second-half 2017. The company has reduced its profit outlook for 2017 factoring in lower expected iron ore prices.Cleveland-Cliffs’ shares have declined around 3.7% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 9% growth.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cleveland-Cliffs is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cleveland-Cliffs for the third quarter is -6.65%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 30 cents and 32 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

235,FMC,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 19.The steel giant witnessed its profits surge year over year in second-quarter 2017, but its earnings and sales fell short of expectations. Nucor logged a profit of $323 million or $1.00 per share for the second quarter, compared to earnings of $243.6 million or 76 cents it registered a year ago. The figure, however, trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07.Revenues went up around 22% year over year to $5,174.8 million in the second quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,307.8 million.  Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average positive surprise of 8.99%.Shares of Nucor have declined 4.8% in the last three months, significantly underperforming the industry’s 6.6% growth.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast month, Nucor provided its revised guidance for third-quarter 2017 and it expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 75-80 cents per share. This is a decrease from $1.00 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 95 cents it earned a year ago.Notably, expected earnings for the third quarter are also lower than the qualitative guidance provided by the company during its second-quarter 2017 earnings call in July. Earlier, the company had expected earnings in the third quarter to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017.Nucor expects a decrease in earnings of the steel mills segment in third-quarter 2017 on a sequential-comparison basis. Regardless of higher utilization rates at its sheet mills, continued import pressure has not allowed pricing to keep pace with rising input costs during the quarter. Earnings of plate mills unit are also anticipated to be considerably less owing to tepid demand in plate end-use markets.The company expects profitability of its steel products unit to improve on a sequential basis in the third-quarter 2017, but less than what was witnessed a year ago. Non-residential construction indicators are showing signs of marginal improvement compared to activity levels in 2016.Moreover, Nucor Steel Louisiana was affected from unexpected outages for most of third-quarter 2017, which caused the company to lower its forecasted earnings estimate for the raw materials segment. The unit halted production in late July for repairing materials handling systems and to address other equipment issues.  Despite the punitive trade actions in the recent past (in the form of imposition of heavy tariffs on imports), the U.S. steel industry still remains under the risk of cheaper imports. Despite the U.S. steel industry’s low capacity utilization, imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. In the first eight months of 2017, finished steel imports have increased by an estimated 16.5% year over year, and accounted for about 28% share of the American market.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.We believe that market sentiments are positive for Praxair, as evident from 19.4% rally in its share price over the last six months. The stock has outperformed 16.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to over the same period. Praxair-Linde Merger DealPraxair signed a business combination agreement with Linde AG in June 2017. The proposed all-stock transaction will combine Praxair’s efficient operating model and Linde’s expertise in engineering and technology, creating a leading industrial gas company with a strong international presence, large customer base and solid financial flexibility.As agreed upon then, Praxair’s shareholders will be offered one share in the new company for each existing share while Linde’s shareholders can exchange each share with 1.54 shares in the new company. Praxair and Linde will each have 50% ownership in the new company.Based on 2016 results, the new holding company’s combined proforma revenues were approximately $29 billion while market capitalization was roughly $70 billion as of May 31. Incorporated in Ireland, the company will have 12-member board of directors and will be listed on both the NYSE and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard segment).The merged company is anticipated to benefit shareholders with realization of annual synergistic benefits of approximately $1.2 billion and cost reduction in a period of three years from closing of the transaction.Subject to pending closing conditions, the parties involved anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.Details of the Supply ContractPer the deal agreed upon, Praxair will supply nitrogen, high purity oxygen, helium and other gases to Shanghai Huali Microelectronics’ production base in Kangqiao Industrial Park. The company will build and operate two new air separation plants, with combined daily production capacity of 600 tons of nitrogen. Praxair anticipates the plant to start production in early 2018.Praxair’s association with Shanghai Huali Microelectronics can be dated back to 2010, when the former started supplying industrial gases to the latter under a long-term bulk supply contract.We believe such contracts reflect customers’ preference for Praxair’s products and will prove beneficial for its growth, going forward. Notably, the Shanghai Huali Microelectronics contract will strengthen the company’s foothold in China, particularly increasing its presence in the semiconductor end market.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of $40.4 billion, Praxair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

247,FMC,"Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) provided updates on third-quarter 2017 results. The company announced a non-cash net of tax charge of $114 million, or $1.05 per share, for goodwill impairment related to the Cast Products business. Allegheny anticipates third-quarter results to be in line with its July outlook excluding the impairment charge. A year-over-year improvement in High Performance Materials and Components segment is expected to continue over the next few years, courtesy of the ongoing next-generation aerospace ramp.  The company’s Flat Rolled Products segment results are expected to be adversely impacted by a sharp decline in raw material prices, mainly ferrochrome and nickel. This is expected to reduce profit margins due to out-of-phase raw material surcharges, resulting in a loss in this segment.  Further, the company expects financial results to be at or near break-even in 2018, and drive profitability by the beginning of 2019.  Sales in the third quarter are expected to be in the range of $865-$875 million with a reported loss in the range of $1.11-$1.14 per share, including the $1.05 per share charge for the goodwill impairment. Excluding this charge, the reported loss is expected in the range of 6 cents-9 cents per share. Allegheny has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year. The company’s shares have moved up around 47.8% during this period compared with a roughly 35% gain recorded by the industry.   Allegheny is likely to benefit from its diversified global growth markets as well as cost-reduction and restructuring measures. The company is seeing healthy demand from aerospace OEMs which should spur growth. However, Allegheny remains exposed to certain challenges in its core Flat Rolled Products segment including weakness across some major end-use markets. Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and Consensus  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and Consensus | Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Quote Allegheny currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the basic material space are The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

259,FMC,"The chemical industry has so far enjoyed a positive run this year, helped by an upswing in the world economy and continued strength across major end-use markets such as construction, automotive and electronics.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market year to date. The industry has gained around 23.6% over this period, higher than S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 14.5%.Strategic Measures to Reap Margin BenefitsChemical companies continue to shift their focus on attractive, growth markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand. Moreover, they remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and perk up growth. Synergies from acquisitions should lend support to their earnings in Q3.  Moreover, cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to yield industry-wide margin improvements in Q3. A number of chemical makers are also taking appropriate pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past) in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs. This is also expected to support their margins in Q3.Strength Across Major End-MarketsChemical makers continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy, backed by steady buyer demand, low mortgage rates, rising rent costs and easy loan availability.The automotive sector also continues its good run, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, improved consumer confidence, low fuel prices and attractive financing options.Harvey-Stoked Disruptions Pose a HeadwindHurricane Harvey weighed on U.S. chemical production during Q3, knocking off a sizable chunk of production capacity. Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast – the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry.In particular, the storm ravaged Texas that accounts for nearly three-quarters of the U.S. production of ethylene, which is among the world’s most important petrochemicals. A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production, leading to reduced supply of this major chemical. As such, the impacts of disruptions caused by Harvey pose some earnings headwinds for U.S. chemical makers in Q3.Q3 Performance So FarThe Q3 earnings season has seen releases from 87 S&P 500 participants as of Oct 20, based on our latest report. The picture so far is encouraging, with total earnings for these companies (representing 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) having increased 9.4% year over year on 7.3% higher sales.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is under the broader Basic Materials sector. The earnings picture for the sector for Q3 looks tepid with a projected decline of 9.3%. This is in contrast to a 7% increase in earnings in Q2.How to Pick the Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the chemicals space, picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One can trim down the list with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) – and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP – the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate – is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of notching up earnings surprises in their next announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as much as 70%. Below we list four chemical stocks that have the right combination of elements to rack up positive surprises this earnings season: FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report)FMC Corp., a leading diversified chemical company, is scheduled to release its Q3 results after the bell on Nov 6.

271,FMC,"On Oct 9, we issued an updated research report on steel producer AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report).AK Steel delivered strong second-quarter 2017 results, reflecting continued benefits obtained through strategic initiatives implemented over the past one-and-a-half year.AK Steel, during second-quarter 2017 earnings call, declared that it expects shipments in the third quarter to be relatively flat compared to the second as higher shipments of the carbon distributing and converting market are expected to be offset by lower automotive shipments. Average selling price in the third quarter is expected to be modestly lower than the second. The expected decline assumes a change in the mix of shipments related to an anticipated reduction in automotive shipments and decline in raw material surcharges.Price Performance Shares of AK Steel have declined 12.7% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 4.8% growth.  Automotive Expansion, Cost-Cuts to Boost Growth AK Steel is expected to benefit from strong demand in the automotive market. AK Steel remains focused on expanding its core automotive business and is laying importance on de-emphasizing commoditized products and launching new value-added products. The company is currently developing third-generation, advanced high-strength carbon steels for automotive customers that are considerably stronger than current product offerings.The acquisition of Precision Partners is also in sync with AK Steel's commitment to broaden its portfolio of high-value products and processes and reinforces collaboration with the company’s automotive market customers.The company’s sustained initiative to manage costs amid a challenging operating environment is also expected to lend support to its bottom line. AK Steel is looking for cost-saving opportunities in 2017 through a number of means including process improvement, headcount cuts, reduction in process time and procurement activities.A Few Headwinds However, AK Steel faces weakness in electrical steel pricing in the overseas markets due to global overcapacity. The company expects the global electrical steel market to remain volatile in the near future due to production overcapacity. AK Steel also remains exposed to margin pressure associated with elevated input costs.Moreover, the U.S. market is still seeing high levels of imports of steel products notwithstanding a series of trade actions in the recent past. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), total and finished steel imports increased 20.6% and 15.5% year over year, respectively, for the first eight months of 2017.

276,FMC,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) announced that it will be implementing an electrode surcharge for all stainless product shipments effective Oct 29.The move is in response to the recent significant hike in cost of graphite electrodes, which is used by the company to produce stainless steel grades in steelmaking operations.   According to AK Steel, the monthly electrode surcharge amount will be listed in the company's monthly surcharge publication. The amount will also be same for all stainless grades produced by the company. For November 2017, electrode surcharge amount for shipments will be $13.20 per ton.Shares of AK Steelhave declined 7% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 6.5% growth.  AK Steel, during second-quarter 2017 earnings call, declared that it expects shipments in the third quarter to be relatively flat compared to the second as higher shipments of the carbon distributing and converting market are expected to be offset by lower automotive shipments. Average selling price in the third quarter is expected to be modestly lower than the second quarter. The expected decline assumes a change in the mix of shipments related to an anticipated reduction in automotive shipments and decline in raw material surcharges.AK Steel is expected to benefit from the strengthening in the automotive market. The company is currently developing third-generation, advanced high-strength carbon steels for its automotive customers that are considerably stronger than current product offerings.Moreover, the recently completed acquisition of Precision Partners is in sync with AK Steel's commitment to broaden its portfolio of high-value products and processes and also advances the company’s focus on the rapidly growing automotive lightweighting industry and its position in advanced high strength steels. It also reinforces collaboration with the company’s automotive market customers.However, AK Steel faces weakness in electrical steel pricing due to global overcapacity. It is also exposed to a volatile raw material pricing environment.

298,FMC,"A couple of chemical companies are gearing up to report their quarterly numbers on Aug 1. The chemical industry is back on track after being roiled by global economic crisis. Chemical makers are gaining from strategic measures including expansion into high-growth markets, aggressive cost management and productivity actions. The industry is also seeing a pick-up in consolidation activities as chemical makers are increasingly looking to diversify their business and enhance operational scale.The industry remains exposed to a few challenges including concerns over China’s economy and weak demand in the energy space. However, its momentum is expected to continue through 2017, supported by continued strength across key end-use markets, an upswing in the world economy and significant shale-linked capital investment.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Based on the latest Earnings Preview, 60% of the sector participants on the S&P 500 index reported their quarterly numbers as of Jul 28.

299,FMC,"FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report) will release its second-quarter 2017 results after the bell on Aug 1. The chemical maker’s adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share for first-quarter 2017 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents (a 23.21% negative surprise). Revenues fell roughly 2% year over year to $596 million in the quarter, and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $743 million.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missed in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 1.46%.FMC Corp.’s shares have rallied 60.2% over the past year, outperforming the 21.8% gain of the industry it belongs to.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to ConsiderFMC Corp., in May, cut its adjusted earnings outlook for 2017 to reflect the impact of the disposal of its Health & Nutrition unit which has been moved to discontinued operations. FMC Corp. now sees adjusted earnings in the band of $2.20 to $2.60 per share for the year, down from $3.20 to $3.60 per share it expected earlier.FMC Corp. is still exposed to challenging agriculture market fundamentals. Agricultural market conditions remain challenging in North America due to elevated channel inventory levels and depressed farm income due to weak commodity prices. The company is also seeing sluggishness in Europe and expects the European agricultural market to be flat to modestly down in 2017.The global crop protection market continues to face several woes, which has resulted in a difficult operating environment. Demand for crop protection products remains weak owing to high channel inventories, reduced pest attacks and soft farm commodity prices.FMC Corp. is also exposed to currency headwinds. The company saw unfavorable currency impact in its European agriculture business in the first quarter contributing to a double-digit decline in sales. It sees sales this business to be modestly down in first-half 2017 due to currency headwinds.Nevertheless, FMC Corp. is seeing strong demand in its Lithium unit. The company, last year, said that it will triple its lithium hydroxide production capacity by adding 20,000 metric tons per year. It will execute this expansion in three phases over the next few years. The move is based on the growing demand for electric vehicles. The company expects its lithium business to deliver strong earnings growth in 2017.The planned acquisition of a major portion of DuPont's  Crop Protection business has also provided a significant growth platform for FMC’s Agricultural Solutions unit. Under the terms of the agreement, FMC Corp. will buy DuPont's Cereal Broadleaf Herbicides and Chewing Insecticides portfolios as well as some of the latter’s Crop Protection research and development pipeline and organization. As part of the deal, DuPont will also purchase FMC's Health & Nutrition business that raked in more than $700 million in revenues in 2016.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FMC Corp. is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for FMC Corp. is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 47 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: FMC Corp. currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against Sell-rated (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) stocks going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.FMC Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  FMC Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FMC Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #2.
