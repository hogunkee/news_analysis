Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 40 cents.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues. However, higher expenses were the major headwind.

On a GAAP basis, Lazard’s net income came in at $160 million or $1.21 per share compared with $108 million or 81 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsIn the first quarter, adjusted operating revenues came in at $724 million, up 16% year over year. The upsurge can chiefly be attributed to increase in financial advisory and asset-management revenues.Adjusted operating expenses were around $518.1 million in the quarter, up 12.6% year over year.

Revenues came in almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Legg Mason’s total operating revenues in the quarter came in at $785.1 million, up 9% year over year.

However, distribution and service fees were down 10.7% year over year to $80.9 million.Operating expenses rose 1% to $618.3 million on a year-over-year basis.

11,AMP,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the market closes. Its earnings and revenues in the quarter are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues. Also, growth in assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) were on the positive side. However, rise in expenses acted as a headwind.That said, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 10.7%.Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ameriprise Financial, Inc. QuoteHowever, activities of the company during the first quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.50 for the to-be-reported quarter decreased nearly 1% over the last 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure represents growth of 29.6% on a year-over-year basis.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.12 billion, which reflects an improvement of 7.6% year over year.However, the company’s price performance has not been very encouraging. Its shares have lost 18.2% in the past three months compared with 12.5% decline of the industry.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings release? To a great extent, this depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to influence the quarter’s results.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsAmeriprise has been consistently making efforts to improve business. This is expected to have a positive impact on its profitability during the quarter.Further, we expect Advice & Wealth Management segment’s (AWM) performance to continue driving the company’s results in the quarter. The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Although the Asset Management segment witnessed inflows in the fourth quarter, it has been witnessing elevated levels of outflows for the last few quarters. In fact, as the company continues to make changes to enhance financial performance, outflows are expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. This might affect the segment’s performance.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income of $360 million for the quarter represents an improvement of 1.4% sequentially. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for management, financial advice and service fee of $1.70 billion, reflects a decline of 1.5% sequentially.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Ameriprise beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of -4.38%.Zacks Rank: Ameriprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further decreases the chances of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 23.

12,AMP,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 economic net income (ENI) of 65 cents per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. However, the figure was 20% below the prior-year quarter level.Shares of Blackstone have gained more than 2% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with its announcement of additional capital deployment action. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.The quarter saw an improvement in assets under management (AUM), mainly driven by inflows. However, lower revenues and a rise in expenses were the undermining factors.Blackstone reported ENI of $791.7 million, down 18% year over year.Revenues & Costs DeclineTotal revenues (GAAP basis) declined 8% year over year to $1.77 billion. The decrease was mainly due to lower total investment income and incentive fees. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 billion.Total expenses (GAAP basis) rose 7% year over year to $982.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a rise in fund expenses and general, administrative and other costs.Fee-earning AUM grew 23% year over year to $334.7 billion. Total AUM amounted to $449.6 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 22% year over year. The rise in total AUM was largely driven by $18.2 billion of inflows.As of Mar 31, 2018, Blackstone had $5.4 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and corporate treasury investments.Capital Deployment UpdateBlackstone authorized share repurchase of up to $1 billion of common units and Blackstone Holdings partnership units. This nearly triples $335.8 million of buyback authorization left under the prior authorization.Moreover, Blackstone received approximately $580 million of pre-tax proceeds in connection with concluding GSO’s investment sub-advisory relationship with FS Investments in April. The company plans to distribute part of the proceeds to unitholders. This will likely result in an incremental 30 cents per unit to be distributed over the next three quarters.Our ViewpointBlackstone remains well positioned to capitalize on the changing investment landscape by making long-term investments and augmenting its fund-raising abilities. However, increased dependence on management and advisory fees can affect the company’s financials in the near term.The Blackstone Group L.P.

13,AMP,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for AMP broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 8.3% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for AMP stock.If that wasn’t enough, Ameriprise Financial isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead.

15,AMP,"Supported by a solid balance sheet, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) is well positioned for organic as well as inorganic growth. Moreover, its efficient capital deployment activities should continue enhancing shareholder value. However, consistently increasing expenses and elevated levels of outflows in the Asset Management segment remain causes for concern.The company’s shares have gained 13.4% in the past year, underperforming 17.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Notably, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has remained stable over the last 30 days. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 1.8% over the last five years (2013-2017). In order to face competition and keep pace with the changing market needs, Ameriprise has been modifying its products and services consistently. Moreover, its efforts to launch new products should further support top-line growth in the future.The company’s inorganic growth story also remains impressive. From time to time, it has restructured its portfolio through acquisitions, sales and spin-offs. In fact, with an aim to remain profitable, it is likely to continue with the restructuring initiatives.However, over the last five years (2013-2017), the company’s expenses have witnessed a CAGR of 1.5%. Elevated costs, mainly because of advertising campaign and technology upgrades, are expected to hurt bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead.Further, elevated levels of outflows in the Asset Management segment, which is one of the major sources of the company’s revenues remains a cause for concern. Management expects outflows to continue in the coming quarters (albeit at a slower pace), which is likely to affect the segment’s performance.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.

26,AMP,"Eaton Vance Corp. (EV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 31) results tomorrow, before the opening bell. Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from increase in revenues supported by its strategic initiatives and a rise in assets under management (AUM). However, higher expenses will likely offset the positives to some extent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is 71 cents, up 34% year over year.Last quarter, Eaton Vance’s adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily hurt by a rise in expenses.Also, Eaton Vance does not boast an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters. Thus, its average earnings surprise was a negative 3.5%.Further, the company’s shares have rallied 14.5% for the three month-ended Jan 31, 2018, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.8%. Will the stock’s price performance improve post fiscal first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Eaton Vance beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Eaton Vance is +2.24%.Zacks Rank: Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOn the revenue front, Eaton Vance is likely to gain from the continued improvement in the global equity markets. Also, AUM is projected witness an improvement during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AUM in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be $443 billion, up 5% sequentially.However, pressure on average effective fee rates is likely to hurt growth in investment advisory and administrative fees. Nonetheless, the top line is likely to witness improvement as outflows from higher fee strategies will likely decrease. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $417 million shows 17.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.On the expense front, Eaton Vance’s NextShares initiative is likely to lead to a slight rise in costs during the quarter. Also, the company’s plan to launch new fund products in the United States might result in higher marketing expenses.Further, non-compensation costs are likely to rise due to higher distribution expenses and fund-related costs. Therefore, overall expenses are expected to trend higher in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookSome other stocks in the same space worth considering are Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report). All the stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2.

27,AMP,"With prudent cost management and strong diversification strategies, Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) appears a solid bet now. The company’s relatively strong distribution platform and consistent well-planned acquisitions are anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Though expenses might escalate for Franklin due to the strictly regulated nature of investment management business and potential investments in the technology, sharper focus on organic growth is expected to make the growth path smoother for the company.During the Q4 earnings season, the Finance sector performed well. Despite inflation-related issues and heightening chances of political uncertainty, easing margin pressure, consumer loan growth, tax benefits from the tax reform and controlled expenses helped most finance stocks to perform well. So, we thought of bringing up a stock from the sector that reflects strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.Particularly, Franklin is one such stock that not only beat estimates this time, but has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 increased 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively.Though shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have declined 9.4% in the last six months, compared with 8.7% growth recorded by the industry, Franklin has a number of other aspects that make it an attractive investment option.Why Franklin is an Attractive PickPrudent Expense Management: Franklin recorded 7%, 14% and 3% declines in operating expenses in fiscals 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. While potential investments in the technology front might escalate expenses in fiscal 2018 (3-5%), previous cost-cutting initiatives will likely improve the top line in the near term..Steady Capital Deployment: Franklin returns sufficient capital to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, the company adopted a new stock trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 in March 2015 to facilitate share buyback under its current repurchase program. In June 2016, it announced an additional repurchase authorization of up to 50 million shares. Moreover, driven by a healthy liquidity position, the company has hiked its dividend every year since its inception in 1981, the latest being the 15% increase in December 2017. The company had also paid a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share in January 2015.Leverage: Franklin’s debt/equity ratio comes in at 0.09 against the S&P 500 average of 0.69, reflecting lower debt burden compared with the industry. It highlights the company’s sound financial flexibility.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Franklin’s ROE of 13.88%, as compared with the industry average of 13.45%, indicates the company’s commendable position over its peers.Stock is Undervalued: Franklin has P/CF and P/B ratios of 11.65 and 1.77 compared to the industry average of 12.03 and 1.80, respectively. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Stocks to ConsiderShares of Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), gained more than 12% over the past six months.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. However, the reported figure came in a penny below the prior-year quarter.Growth in assets under management (AUM) was a positive.

The fall was mainly attributed to lower financial advisory revenues, mostly offset by higher asset management revenues.Adjusted operating expenses were around $493.5 million in the quarter, slightly up year over year. Higher non-compensation expenses were mostly offset by lower compensation and benefits.Adjusted compensation and benefits expense declined 2.4% on a year-over-year basis to $366.9 million. Adjusted non-compensation expense for the quarter was $126.6 million, up 10% year over year.The ratio of compensation expense to operating revenues was 53.8%, marginally down from 54.9% witnessed in the prior-year quarter. The ratio of non-compensation expense to operating revenues was 18.5% compared with 16.8% recorded in the year-ago quarter.The company affirmed its annual targets of an adjusted non-compensation expense-to-revenue ratio between 16% and 20%, while the compensation-to-operating revenue ratio target is in the mid-to high 50 percentage range.Segment PerformanceFinancial Advisory: The segment’s total revenues came in at $335 million, down 17% from the year-earlier quarter. The decline was primarily due to decrease in revenues from strategic advisory and lower restructuring revenues.Asset Management: The segment’s total revenues were $339 million, up 23% from the prior-year quarter. Higher management and incentive fees led to this rise.Corporate: The segment generated total revenues of $8.6 million, which increased significantly from the prior-year quarter.Strong AUMAs of Dec 31, 2017, AUM was recorded at $249.5 billion, up 26% year over year.

The company’s stockholders’ equity was $1.26 billion compared with $1.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.    Steady Capital Deployment ActivityDuring 2017, Lazard returned $716 million to its shareholders. This included dividend payment of $341 million, share repurchase of $307 million and $68 million paid for meeting employee-tax obligations in exchange of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.Our ViewpointResults reflect an impressive quarter for Lazard. Though the company’s diverse footprint, steady capital-deployment activities and revenue strength position it favorably for the long run, macro headwinds, elevated costs pressure and stringent regulations put the company’s financials under strain. Lazard Ltd.

38,AMP,"The performance of the investment management/brokerage industry (part of the broader Finance sector) has been decent over the last several quarters. With the rise in interest rates, majority of the investment managers have stopped waiving off their fees, which has aided top-line growth. Moreover, given that interest rates are expected to continue to increase in the future, the industry is likely to further benefit.Talking about the last three months of 2017, the quarter witnessed potential rise in equity issuances as well as persistent increase in debt underwriting, which led to strengthening of investment banking.However, because of continued low volatility in both the bond and equity markets, trading activities remained sluggish in the quarter. This resulted in a decline in overall trading revenues.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the investment management/brokerage industry for the recently concluded quarter are projected to improve 4.5% year over year.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report), Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report), SEI Investments Co. (SEIC  -  Free Report) and Legg Mason, Inc.

The segment’s performance is likely to aid the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.10 for the to-be-reported quarter represents growth of 13.6% on a year-over-year basis.However, results might be negatively impacted because of persistent outflows witnessed in the Asset Management segment.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.03 billion, reflecting 1.2% year-over-year decline.Ameriprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, despite, a large number of new M&As announced in the quarter, M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally remained weak. Thus, advisory fee growth is also expected to remain muted.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the quarter is $1.7billion, reflecting 14% growth year over year.

As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.10 for the to-be-reported quarter decreased 1.3% over the last seven days. Nonetheless, the figure represents growth of 13.6% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.03 billion for the quarter, which is expected to witness a decline of 1.2% year over year.Notably, the company’s price performance has been quite encouraging.

Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Ameriprise beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of -1.88%.Zacks Rank: Ameriprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAmeriprise has been consistently making efforts to improve its business. This is expected to have a positive impact on its profitability during the quarter.Further, we expect Advice & Wealth Management segment’s (AWM) performance to continue driving the company’s results in the quarter. The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company expects margin expansion in the AWM segment to continue, assuming that no significant market disruptions will take place.However, the Asset Management segment has been witnessing elevated levels of outflows for the last few quarters. In fact, as the company continues to make changes to enhance financial performance, outflows are expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. This might affect the segment’s performance. Nonetheless, as the company enters more normalized markets, margins in this segment are anticipated to improve to the range of 35-39%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 24. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

43,AMP,"Switzerland’s financial regulator FINMA, which had earlier sanctioned the Swiss subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) for money laundering, said that it will now conduct an in-depth review of the unit’s anti-money laundering systems. This is because the regulatory body has found that the banking giant has seriously breached anti-money laundering regulations in its dealings with the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.In June, FINMA concluded certain enforcement proceedings against the company’s Swiss unit wherein no penalties were imposed on the company because FINMA believed that any profits possibly made from the alleged violations were not significant enough.However, now the regulator has discovered serious shortcomings in the company’s monitoring and control systems in relation to its dealings with the allegedly corrupt sovereign wealth fund.FINMA said, “The bank seriously breached anti-money laundering regulations by failing to screen adequately transactions and business relationships booked in Switzerland associated with the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB and one of its business partners.""The alleged infringements took place between 2009 and 2011 when in a particular case, JPMorgan failed to properly screen the transfer of “hundreds of millions"" of U.S. dollars from 1MDB to the personal account of an individual, which was actually meant for business purposes.The banking giant has also accepted that it had taken incomplete or inconsistent information from its clients without examining the content further or documenting it.Notably, the Swiss regulator’s decision is final and JPMorgan has not yet appealed against it.In fact, the bank said, ""There is nothing more important to us than the safety and soundness of the global monetary system. The resolution announced by Finma relates to matters that took place many years ago in the Swiss private bank, and since that time, we have increased training, added staff and made improvements in monitoring and surveillance.""Though, FINMA has neither issued any enforcement proceedings against any of the individuals nor has imposed any fine on the bank, it stated, “Given the inadequacy of the bank's controls and the serious breaches which have been identified in this case, Finma will conduct an in-depth review of the bank's anti-money laundering systems. To this end, Finma has appointed a monitor to carry out an on-site review of the appropriateness and functioning of the bank's controls and monitor them on an ongoing basis.""Although JPMorgan has resolved quite a few litigation issues, it still faces probes and queries from several federal agencies and a few foreign governments for its businesses conducted in the pre-crisis period. As a result, the company’s legal expenses are expected to remain elevated, which might marginally affect its bottom-line growth in the near term.Shares of the company have rallied 23.9% in the past year, outperforming the 16.8% growth of the industry it belongs to.Currently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Lazard Ltd.

Earnings of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, results compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents per share.Top-line strength and growth in assets under management (AUM) were recorded. Nevertheless, elevated operating expenses were a headwind. Net outflows were also an undermining factor.For fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $3.01 versus $2.94 recorded in the prior year. Moreover, earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 by 4 cents per share.Net income was $425.2 million in the quarter compared with $472.1 million witnessed in the prior-year quarter.

Further, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.41 billion.Total operating revenues increased slightly year over year, to $1.62 billion in the quarter, mainly due to higher investment management and other fees, mostly offset by lower sales and distribution fees and shareholder servicing fees. Yet, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 billion.Investment management fees inched up 1% year over year to $1.11 billion, while sales and distribution fees were down 4% year over year to $421.8 million. In addition, shareholder servicing fees descended 4%, on a year-over-year basis, to $56 million, while other net revenues escalated 80% year over year to $29.3 million.Total operating expenses flared up 3% year over year to $1.06 billion. The rise resulted mainly from elevated compensation and benefits, general, administrative, and information systems and technology expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower sales, distribution and marketing, along with occupancy expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, total AUM came in at $753.2 billion, up 3% from $733.3 billion as of Sep 30, 2016.

The company reported adjusted net income of 79 cents per share, considerably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents.

In addition, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $739.1 million.Investment advisory fees increased 5.3% year over year to $686.9 million in the quarter. However, other revenues plummeted 52.6% year over year to $0.7 million. Furthermore, distribution and service fees were down 14.6% year over year to $80.7 million.Operating expenses inched up 1% to $623.9 million on a year-over-year basis. The rise was chiefly due to higher other expenses, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses, distribution and servicing costs, and occupancy expenses.Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 24.9%, up from 22.7% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Solid Assets PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, Legg Mason’s AUM was $754.4 billion, up 2.9% year over year from $732.9 billion. Of the total AUM, fixed income constituted 54%, equity 27%, liquidity 10% and alternatives represented 9%.AUM inched up 1.8% sequentially from $741.2 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, driven by upbeat market performance and other of $12.5 billion, liquidity inflows of $0.2 billion and $2.2 billion in positive foreign exchange. These positives were partially offset by long-term outflows of $1.2 billion.Notably, long-term net outflows of $1.2 billion included equity outflows of $2 billion and alternative outflows of $0.7 billion, partially mitigated by fixed income inflows of $1.5 billion.

In addition to this, with strategic acquisitions, restructuring initiatives and cost-cutting measures, we anticipate operating efficiencies to improve. Also, steady capital deployment activities continue to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. However, escalating expenses remain a key concern. Legg Mason, Inc.

54,AMP,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Oct 24. While its earnings are expected to grow year over year, revenues are expected to witness a decline.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by higher revenues and lower expenses. Also, assets under management (AUM) witnessed growth.That said, the company also has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.4%.Moreover, activities of the company during the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings increased 2.5% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents growth of 24.9% on a year-over-year basis.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $2.95 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, which is expected to witness a decline of 1.5% year over year.Notably, the company’s price performance has been quite encouraging. Ameriprise’s shares have gained 38.9% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of 27%.AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Price and EPS Surprise  AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Price and EPS Surprise | AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings release? To a great extent this depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Ameriprise beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of -0.52%.Zacks Rank: Ameriprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsAmeriprise has been consistently making efforts to improve its business. This is expected to have a positive impact on profitability during the quarter.Further, we expect Advice & Wealth Management segment’s (AWM) performance to continue driving the company’s results in the quarter. The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company expects margin expansion in the AWM segment to continue, assuming that no significant market disruptions will take place.However, the Asset Management segment has been witnessing elevated levels of outflows for the last few quarters. In fact, as the company continues to make changes to enhance financial performance, outflows are expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. This might adversely affect the segment’s performance.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Oct 24. It has an earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. It is scheduled to report results on Oct 25.Lazard Ltd. (LAZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Oct 26.

Also, the top line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Total expenses (GAAP basis) rose17% year over year to $903.8 million. The increase was primarily due to a drastic surge in fund expenses.Fee-earning AUM grew 7% year over year to $285.7 billion.

59,AMP,"Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation, affirmed the ratings of Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report). The outlook has been raised from negative to stable. Also, the company’s senior unsecured debt rating has been affirmed at Baa1.The ratings are based on Legg Mason’s progress on acquisitions along with improved investment performance. Also, continuous net inflows to its global distribution unit have led to stable rating. Lastly, stabilization of its credit profile as reflected by lower leverage supported the ratings.Reasons Behind the AffirmationLegg Mason’s senior unsecured rating of Baa1 is indicative of its strong business profile due to the acquisition spree it was involved in between late 2015 and early 2016, and a weaker financial profile. Its acquisition of EnTrust, Clarion and RARE Infrastructure have greatly diversified the product offerings and expanded scale of business. However, the debt level remains elevated from the level before these acquisitions. Moody’s is apprehensive of the pressure on Legg Mason’s financial flexibility due to lower margins and significant use of cash flow for share repurchases. Nevertheless, the concern of extensive cash use is partially mitigated by lower effective cash tax rate.Per Moody’s, Legg Mason’s performance of key products has improved greatly through past strategic moves. Also, revenues have increased on account of higher assets under management (AUM), organic and performance growth. Sales have grown on the back of the company’s initiatives to broaden the vehicles through which clients invest in its products, especially separately managed accounts. Also, its efforts to refine distribution strategy have resulted in continuous net inflows to its global distribution unit.Leverage as a multiple of EBITDA (per Moody’s calculation) stands at 3.3x, which is below of 3.8x as of March 2016, but is still considered to be high for an asset-manager rated Baa1. The improvement in leverage comes from cost efficiencies that have led to margin improvements and the use of $750 million of junior securities (to which Moody's assigns 25% equity credit).What Could Make Moody's Change the Ratings?Legg Mason’s ratings can be revised higher on account of improvement in its market position and asset resilience due to inflows in investment platforms and development of products and services offered. Lastly, total debt / EBITDA ratio of below 2 supported by sufficient excess liquidity would led to a higher rating.On the flip side, Legg Mason's long-term ratings could be downgraded if its AUM resiliency scores decline due to acceleration of net outflows of long-term assets or weak new sales and total debt/EBITDA ratio remains above 4.Shares of Legg Mason have gained 29.2% year to date, outperforming the 24.7% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks That Warrant a LookBlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate have been revised slightly upward for the current year, in the past 60 days.

60,AMP,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating has been affirmed at “a-” by A.M. Best. The company’s Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings have also been affirmed. The ratings outlook remains stable.Additionally, A.M. Best has affirmed RiverSource Life Insurance Company and its subsidiary’s Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “aa-” and its Financial Strength Rating of A+.Also, the Financial Strength Rating and Long-TermIssuer Credit Rating of IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiary have been affirmed at “A” and “a+”, respectively.RiverSource Life Insurance Company is based in Minneapolis and is the key life/health insurance subsidiary of Ameriprise, while IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company is the property/casualty insurance subsidiary of Ameriprise.Ameriprise remains well positioned for growth, given its discipline in financial planning and strengths in product development. The company has an effective and well-developed enterprise risk management program in place, which helps in hedging risks. Additionally, Ameriprise offers various variable annuity as well as fixed annuity products to retail clients through its Annuities segment. These variable annuity products offer relatively modest guarantees, which help in reducing variable annuity guarantee risks for the company. Notably, Ameriprise is on track to effectively cover its interest payments and maintains moderate financial leverage.However, Ameriprise’s operations are highly correlated with the performance of the equity markets and client activities. Over the last few quarters, equity markets have remained volatile. Also, client activity is low. Thus, A.M. Best believes that if interest rates remain low for annuity and long-term care insurance businesses, Ameriprise’s operating margins will be hurt.Also, the Asset Management segment remains one of the major sources of Ameriprise’s revenues. The segment has been witnessing outflows over the past few years. In fact, due to uncertainty in financial markets and stiff competition, outflows are expected to continue in the coming quarters, thus affecting the segment’s performance.Nevertheless, it is on account of the various positives of the company that its ratings have been affirmed at the current level.The ratings affirmation of RiverSource Life Insurance Company reflect its solid risk-adjusted capital position, effective hedging programs, favorable operating results and strong market position.On the other hand, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company, along with its subsidiary, provides diversification benefits to Ameriprise. It helps in diversifying risks and earnings, offers products to affinity partners and its municipal bond portfolio provides tax benefits.Ameriprise’s shares have gained 47.2% in a year’s time, outperforming the 27.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM  -  Free Report), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.

This suggests that it is more efficient in reinvesting its earnings.However, its debt/equity ratio, which stands at 0.88, is significantly above the industry average of 0.07.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.Last quarter, Eaton Vance’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily aided by a rise in revenues, partly offset by higher expenses.Nonetheless, Eaton Vance does not boast an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters while reporting in-line results in another. Thus, the company has an average negative surprise of 2.6%.Eaton Vance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Eaton Vance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Eaton Vance Corporation QuoteFurther, the company’s share price has increased 11.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rise of 16.5%. Will the stock’s price performance improve post fiscal third-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that the chances of Eaton Vance to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Eaton Vance is +0.50%.Zacks Rank: Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents reflects year-over-year growth of 19.6%.Factors at PlayOn the revenue front, Eaton Vance is likely to gain from the continued improvement in the global equity markets. Also, assets under management (AUM) should witness an improvement during the quarter. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company reported a 2.1% rise in AUM from the Apr 30, 2017 level.However, pressure on average effective fee rates is likely to hurt growth in investment advisory and administrative fees. Nonetheless, the top line is likely to witness a slight improvement in case outflows from higher fee strategies abate.On the expense front, Eaton Vance’s NextShares initiative should lead a slight rise in costs during the quarter. Also, the company’s plan to launch new fund products in the U.S. should lead to higher marketing expenses.Also, non-compensation costs are likely to rise due to higher distribution expenses and fund-related costs. Hence, overall expenses should trend higher in the quarter.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookSome other stocks in the financial space worth considering are Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

75,AMP,"Hercules Capital, Inc. (HTGC  -  Free Report) remains well-positioned to grow in the future supported by its increasing loan originations. Moreover, given a solid liquidity and capital position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, mounting expenses are expected to hurt bottom-line growth. Also, concentration risk remains a major concern.The company’s price performance has also not been very encouraging.

Moreover, with the improving economic conditions, the company is likely to witness increased demand for financing from private equity firms and venture capitalists in the near term.Further, Hercules Capital’s steady capital deployment activities continue to enhance investors’ confidence.

Costs have risen at a CAGR of 7.5% over the last four years (ended 2016). Continued increase in compensation costs is mainly attributable to this escalation.

80,AMP,"In order to take advantage of Japan’s prevailing easing monetary policy, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) alternative asset management unit wants to invest in the country’s real estate and infrastructure. The news was reported by Bloomberg.Although the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have started tightening monetary policies, Bank of Japan’s Governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, plans to continue with “powerful monetary easing” in order to encourage positive inflation in the country.According to the BoJ’s guidance for short-term interest rates and 10-year government bond yields, borrowing costs are expected to remain low in Japan.The managing partner of JPMorgan Global Alternatives, Anton Pil, said, “Leverage is still very inexpensive in Japan, so you can use a degree of leverage to enhance returns. Many foreigners want to get exposure to Japanese real estate because the Bank of Japan is on a different schedule.”In fact, Pil believes that as the Federal Reserve sells bonds with an aim to reduce its balance sheet, alternative asset classes are likely to attract more attention and become lucrative for investors.According to Pil, since investors nowadays look for non-traditional forms of fixed income, which can generate cash as well as serve as an inflation hedge, the Japanese real estate and infrastructure is becoming more attractive.However, Pil does not aim to use “significant” leverage. According to him, nearly 35% to 50% of leverage is sufficient. He stated, “If you go north of that, real estate doesn’t become the driver, but the leverage becomes the driver of your return.”JPMorgan’s shares have gained 24.6% in a year’s time, outperforming 17.4% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

85,AMP,"Eaton Vance Corp. (EV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 (ended Oct 31) results tomorrow, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from increase in revenues supported by its strategic initiatives and a rise in assets under management (AUM). However, higher expenses will likely offset the positives to some extent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is 71 cents, up 24.2% year over year.Last quarter, Eaton Vance’s adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily hurt by a rise in expenses.Also, Eaton Vance does not boast an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters. Thus, the company came up with an average negative surprise of 4.4%.Eaton Vance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Eaton Vance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Eaton Vance Corporation QuoteFurther, the company’s shares have rallied 23.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 25.2%. Will the stock’s price performance improve post fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Eaton Vance beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Eaton Vance is +0.99%.Zacks Rank: Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors at PlayOn the revenue front, Eaton Vance is likely to gain from the continued improvement in the global equity markets. Also, AUM is projected witness an improvement during the quarter. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company reported a 3.4% rise in AUM from the Jul 31, 2017 level.However, pressure on average effective fee rates is likely to hurt growth in investment advisory and administrative fees. Nonetheless, the top line is likely to witness improvement if outflows from higher fee strategies decrease. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues shows 18.1% increase from the prior-year quarter.On the expense front, Eaton Vance’s NextShares initiative is likely to lead a slight rise in costs during the quarter. Also, the company’s plan to launch new fund products in the United States might result in higher marketing expenses.Also, non-compensation costs are likely to rise due to higher distribution expenses and fund-related costs. Hence, overall expenses are expected to trend higher in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookSome other stocks in the same space worth considering are Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Moreover, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $613 million.Adjusted operating expenses were around $523 million in the quarter, up 24.9% year over year. Higher compensation and benefits and non-compensation expenses led to the upsurge.Adjusted compensation and benefits expense flared up 33% on a year-over-year basis to $406.9 million. Adjusted non-compensation expense for the quarter was $116.1 million, up 4% year over year.The ratio of compensation expense to operating revenue was 56.5%, in line with the prior-year quarter. The ratio of non-compensation expense to operating revenue was 16.1% compared with 20.7% in the prior-year quarter.The company affirmed its annual targets of an adjusted non-compensation expense-to-revenue ratio between 16% and 20%, while the compensation-to-operating revenue ratio target is in the mid-to high 50 percentage range.Segment PerformanceFinancial Advisory: The segment’s total revenue was $411 million, up 43% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was primarily due to an increase in revenues from M&A and strategic advisory, as well as higher restructuring revenues.Asset Management: The segment’s total revenue was $307 million, up 22% from the prior-year quarter. Higher management, incentive and other fees led to the rise.Corporate: The segment generated total revenue of $2.5 million, which plunged 46% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Assets Under Management (AUM)As of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was recorded at $226 billion, up 18% year over year. The quarter experienced market and foreign exchange appreciation of $10.9 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $365 million.Average AUM came in at $222 billion, rising 15% year over year.Stable Balance SheetLazard’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $956 million as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with $1.16 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. The company’s stockholders’ equity was $1.30 billion compared with $1.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Steady Capital Deployment ActivityDuring second-quarter 2017, Lazard returned $133 million to its shareholders. This included dividend payment of $50 million, share repurchase of $79 million and $4 million paid for meeting employee tax obligations in exchange of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.Our ViewpointResults reflect a decent quarter for Lazard. Though the company’s diverse footprint, steady capital deployment activities and revenue strength position it favorably for the long run; macro headwinds, elevated costs pressure and stringent regulations put the company’s financials under strain. Lazard Ltd.

95,AMP,"Federated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of around 6% for second-quarter 2017, marking the ninth straight quarter of earnings beat. Earnings per share of 53 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents and improved 3.9% year over year.The results were driven by lower expenses and considerable improvement in non-operating income. However, decline in revenues and assets under management (AUM) were the undermining factors.Net income for the quarter came in at $53.5 million, up 1% year over year.Revenues and Costs DeclineTotal revenue for the second quarter declined 5% year over year to $272.8 million. Further, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $277.4 million.The decline in revenues can mainly be attributed to decreased revenues from lower average money market assets and a reduction in revenue resulting from a change in a customer relationship. It was partially offset by reduced voluntary fee waivers related to money market funds and increased revenues from higher average equity assets.In addition, net service fees increased 19% year over year to $47.4 million. However, administrative service fees were down 14% to $45.6 million. Also, net investment advisory fees declined 7% to $179.3 million.During the reported quarter, Federated derived 40% of its revenues from money market assets and the remaining 60% from equity and fixed-income assets.Further, supported by a 256% rise in net investment income to $3.9 million, the company recorded a spectacular improvement in non-operating income from the year ago quarter.Total operating expenses declined 5% year over year to $188.6 million. Less expenses primarily exhibit a decrease in compensation and related expenses, resulting from lower incentive compensation and a decrease in distribution expenses.Assets and AUMFederated witnessed equity assets of $65.8 billion, up 6% year over year. Additionally, fixed-income assets grew 4% year over year to $52.5 billion.As of Jun 30, 2017, total AUM was $360.4 billion, down 2% year over year.

96,AMP,"Legg Mason Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) reported positive earnings surprise of 53.5% in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jun 30). The company reported adjusted net income of 66 cents per share, considerably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. However, results compared unfavorably with 79 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Solid top-line performance and steady assets under management (AUM) were the tailwinds. However, escalating expenses remain a concern.Including one-time items, Legg Mason reported net income of $50.9 million or 52 cents per share compared with $33.5 million or 31 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenue Rises, Expenses Flare UpLegg Mason’s total operating revenue in the quarter came in at $793.8 million, up 13.4% year over year. The upsurge was mainly due to elevated average long term AUM and performance fees, along with revenues associated with the addition of Clarion and EnTrust. In addition, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $779.2 million.Investment advisory fees increased 17.4% year over year to $713.7 million in the quarter. Additionally, other revenues climbed 10% year over year to $1.1 million. However, distribution and service fees were down 13.7% year over year to $78.9 million.Operating expenses increased 10.0% to $686.6 million on a year-over-year basis. The rise was chiefly due to higher compensation and benefits (up 15.3%), and expenses related to impairment of intangible assets.Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 22.5%, significantly up from 11.3% in the prior-year quarter. Lower acquisition and transition-related costs led to the rise.Solid Assets PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, Legg Mason’s AUM was $741.2 billion, down slightly year over year from $741.9 billion. Of the total AUM, fixed income constituted 55%, equity 26%, liquidity 10% and alternatives represented 9%.AUM inched up 1.8% sequentially from $728.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2017, driven by positive market performance of $8.4 billion, long-term net inflows of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion in positive foreign exchange. These positives were partially offset by liquidity outflows of $11.5 billion. Notably, change in category of $16.0 billion of separately managed account assets which were previously classified as Assets Under Advisement also positively impacted AUM.Notably, long-term net inflows of $0.5 billion included equity inflows of $1.0 billion and fixed income inflows of $0.3 billion, partially mitigated by alternative outflows of $0.8 billion. Additionally, average AUM was $740.3 billion compared with $709.1 billion in the prior-year quarter and $718.9 billion in the prior quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, Legg Mason had $491 million in cash. Total debt was $2.2 billion, while shareholders’ equity came in at $4.0 billion.The ratio of total debt to total capital (total equity plus total debt excluding consolidated investment vehicles) was 36%, in line with the prior quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateLegg Mason repurchased 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $90 million in the reported quarter, while 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $12 million were repurchased under net share settlements of annual deferred compensation award vesting.Our ViewpointWe believe Legg Mason has the potential to outperform its peers over the long run, given its diversified product mix and leverage in the changing market demography. Further, with strategic acquisitions, restructuring initiatives and cost-cutting measures, we anticipate operating efficiencies to improve. Also, steady capital deployment activities continue to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. However, escalating expenses remain a key concern. Legg Mason, Inc.

98,AMP,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are anticipated on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management  (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report), Ameriprise Financial Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), have already released results. Out of these, Blackstone Group and BlackRock missed estimates despite recording AUM growth, while T.

(BEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2017 (ended Jun 30) results before the opening bell. Given Franklin’s AUM disclosure for Jun 2017, the upcoming release will display higher assets under management on a year-over-year basis. Franklin’s cost-control efforts should support bottom-line growth to some extent.  Notably, management expects expenses in fiscal 2017 to remain flat or decline slightly, considering the impact of previous cost-cutting initiatives.In addition, we believe that the company’s top line will likely get support from its diversified portfolio offerings, as well as global presence (read more: Franklin to Post Q3 Earnings: A Surprise in the Cards?).Moreover, our proven quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat.

Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, as they aggressively market their products, is expected to slightly hurt the bottom line.Notably, per the Earnings Preview, overall earnings growth for the Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 is expected to be 6.9%.So, this is the right time to add a few investment management stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report their earnings.

Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by higher revenues.

However, a rise in expenses was the major downside.That said, the company does not have a very impressive earnings surprise history, as it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the trailing four quarters.Nevertheless, the company’s price performance has been quite encouraging.

QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q2 earnings?Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Ameriprise will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around.

The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects margin expansion in the AWM segment to continue over time, assuming no significant market disruptions.Management expects Department of Labor related expenses in the to-be-reported quarter to decline on a sequential basis.However, Ameriprise’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 to remain stable over the last 30 days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Banc of California, Inc.
