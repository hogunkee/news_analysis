1,NDAQ,"Bitcoin punched through the $11,000 barrier early Wednesday, after blasting through $10,000 a day earlier, but the cryptocurrency fell back below $10,000 in afternoon trading amid growing concerns over a bubble.X Meanwhile, Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Cantor Fitzgerald will launch Bitcoin futures, joining similar planned moves by CME Group (CME) and CBOE (CBOE)Bitcoin and blockchain-related investments such as Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) and Overstock (OSTK) continued to swing.Bitcoin soared as $11,377 in the morning then crashed to $9,290 before trading at $9,790, according to Coindesk.com. The cryptocurrency a week ago was at $8,000. A year ago, it was hovering in the $700 range.Michael Novogratz, former manager at the hedge fund Fortress, on Monday told CNBC that Bitcoin could close out next year at $40,000.But bigger investors have stepped in, and mainstream financial institutions have started to open up to the currency.Nasdaq reportedly will introduce Bitcoin futures in the first half of 2018. Cantor Fitzgerald also says it will introduce futures for the cryptocurrency. CME Group has said it will launch Bitcoin futures by the end of the year. Bitcoin futures from CBOE could debut by early next year.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is reportedly deciding whether to allow clients to bet on Bitcoin. That's after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the currency a ""fraud,"" and said it would implode and that he would fire any trader caught dealing in the currency.And Goldman Sachs (GS) is, according to reports, weighing whether to offer a Bitcoin trading operation, although CEO Lloyd Blankfein, like others, has said that Bitcoin might be ""kind of a bubble.""IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game?

2,NDAQ,"Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard — as they did on Friday — then arrived some more. Concerns were raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up the world's energy. Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy Bitcoin.""X Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from Cboe (CBOE), CME Group (CME) and, eventually, Nasdaq (NDAQ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA) and Net Element (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if investors are prepared for the more complicated world of investing next year that the futures will bring — to a market where 40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the possession of 1,000 holders who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his account — does he know how to protect it when trading might go against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another $1,000 later in the day, after a week of warnings from financial officials abroad and worries about possible insider trading. Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases, the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000, I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would trade on the stock market — a development Dusaniwsky said was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the more opportunity to short. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's Bitcoin futures, and rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely staying away from doing it themselves.But Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes to have it running by the end of June, sources told Bloomberg Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now, said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks' wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see JPMorgan (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings — a form of digital fundraising — that it deemed suspicious or in violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities' promotions of things like ICOs — an announcement that came after Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown their support behind them. ""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August, and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile, lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others have, that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called Bitcoin the ""bubble to end all bubbles"". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""Please invest responsibly.""""Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market. They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said, or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said, ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

4,NDAQ,"UBS' global chief economist on Monday said that Bitcoin's rise to feverish heights over the past few months represents a massive bubble, while the Securities and Exchange Commission said it stopped another planned initial coin offering.X ""The bubble to end all bubbles continues,"" the economist, Paul Donovan, wrote in a post on Monday. ""Cryptocurrencies only have value if accepted as currencies. However, they cannot be used for the most important transaction in an economy, and cryptocurrency supply can only rise and never fall (making them a poor store of value).

5,NDAQ,"The futures contracts could open up a path for a Bitcoin ETF and give more investors a chance to bet for or against the cryptocurrency without holding it directly. The futures could also allow for more opportunity to take short positions against Bitcoin and potentially tame its whipsaw pricing action.The cryptocurrency scene in general could also be tamed by growing pressure from regulators. The SEC on Monday said that a California-based company, Munchee, which provides a blockchain-based food review service, had stopped a planned initial coin offering after the agency found that the company's actions ""constituted unregistered securities offers and sales.""Munchee, the SEC said, agreed to a cease-and-desist order without admitting to or denying the agency's findings.Last week, the SEC said it halted what it alleged was a ""fast-moving Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud"" committed by a company called PlexCorps that had raised as much as $15 million since August. The SEC said the company had promised a 13-fold profit in under a month. The charges stemming from that investigation were the first to be filed by the SEC's new cyber unit.Meanwhile, the bumpy ride continued for Bitcoin stocks. Riot Blockchain (RIOT), a company that invests in blockchain technology, soared 45.5% to 23.08 in the stock market today after it said a payments company in its portfolio intended to merge with a company focused on mineral-resources exploration.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an investment vehicle that attempts to track Bitcoin's movements, burst 12% higher to 1,850.24 after briefly imploding to as low as 75 cents.RELATED:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsHow To Decide If Bitcoin Is Safe For You To Trade

8,NDAQ,"Bitcoin just passed $11,000, and a bid by the world's largest futures exchange to make it even more mainstream is probably inevitable.But that doesn't mean U.S. regulators will let trading resemble the Wild West.Since CME Group (CME) announced last month it would bring Bitcoin to the derivatives market, the company has been in heavy negotiations with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While the agency has limited power to halt CME's plans — or a proposal from Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. (CBOE) — it is demanding changes.The CFTC has been working with the companies to ""address various issues, and to change some aspects of the contracts,"" Erica Elliott Richardson, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement. ""We expect that outstanding issues will be resolved in the near future,"" she added, without providing specifics.Bitcoin is on a tear in 2017, an 11-fold surge that took off even more after CME Chief Executive Officer Terrence Duffy announced in October that the company would offer futures trading by the end of the year. The move is considered key to Wall Street's broader embrace of the crypotcurrency, likely enabling increased speculation and — perhaps someday — products such as exchange traded funds.Still, Bitcoin's jump has been met with caution in some circles, and outright dismissal in others. Vanguard Group Inc. founder John Bogle advised investors on Tuesday to avoid the virtual currency ""like the plague,"" while JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has called it an asset bubble and a fraud.Under U.S. law, exchanges like CME, which profit from increased trading volumes, can approve new futures contracts themselves. The process, which is used in most cases, is known as self-certification and involves sending a written confirmation to the CFTC that the contract complies with relevant rules. Often, agency officials will engage in a back-and-forth with a company.Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ) also intends to introduce Bitcoin futures and is planning to roll them out next year, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussion a private matter.Spokesmen for CME and Nasdaq declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Cboe didn't respond to a request for comment.CME and Cboe have provided the CFTC with draft terms for contracts governing Bitcoin futures, said Elliott Richardson, the agency spokeswoman. She added that ""concerns about Bitcoin futures expressed by some market participants"" have been a factor in the CFTC's discussions with the companies.Earlier this month, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that Bitcoin's large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn't be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives. An outsize loss on the digital currency could cripple a firm, preventing it from meeting its obligations to pay out on all sorts of contracts.""A large cryptocurrency price move that destabilizes members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilize the clearing organization itself,"" wrote Peterffy, whose firm is a CME clearing member. That could impair ""its ability to satisfy its fundamental obligation to pay the winners and collect from the losers on the other products in the same clearing pool,"" he said.The CFTC has been reviewing CME's and Cboe's plans for managing risks associated with Bitcoin futures and collateral requirements, said Elliott Richardson. Cboe's contracts will be cleared by Options Clearing Corp., while CME will clear its own futures. CME has estimated that initial margin on the contracts — or the amount of collateral set aside relative to the value of a trade — may be as high as 30%, an unusually high amount.""Once the contracts are launched, commission staff will engage in a variety of risk-monitoring and oversight activities,"" said the CFTC's Elliott Richardson. ""These activities include monitoring and stress-testing positions and observing and analyzing open interest, initial margin requirements, and variation margin payments.""

9,NDAQ,"Bitcoin continued to trade wildly on Thursday, a day after swelling past $11,000 and then face-planted at below $10,000, as Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the cryptocurrency doesn't meet traditional standards for money while a top Federal Reserve policymaker said Bitcoin is a ""niche product.""X The digital currency, ever sensitive to price swings and the emotions of big and small investors alike, was down 2.8% to $9,540.14 in afternoon trading after sinking to $9,021 intraday. Etherium, another cryptocurrency, was down 2.4% to $427.51, but off their worst levels too.Last week, Bitcoin hovered in the $8,000 range. The latest big price swings come as more smaller, less sophisticated investors, curious about the hype, hop aboard and then bail on what has become a wild ride this year for the cryptocurrency.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Thursday that it's too soon for his bank to develop a Bitcoin strategy, and questioned calling the digital instrument a ""currency.""""Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency, doesn't feel like a store of value,"" Blankefein told Bloomberg Television.Goldman's commodity chief said Wednesday that Bitcoin should be treated as a commodity.Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said Thursday dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could be a major rival to established currencies or that the Fed itself would issue its own cryptocurrency.""Digital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners large headlines,"" Quarles said. He warned that digital currencies could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if they became widely used.A Bank of England official on Wednesday downplayed the risks of the cryptocurrency, but urged caution nonetheless.""This is not at a size where it's a macroeconomic risk to the global economy,"" Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor with the central bank, told BBC Radio 5 Live, according to the Guardian, ""but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.""But Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's former chief economist and a Nobel Prize winner, told Bloomberg on Wednesday that ""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight. So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed.""David Mondrus, CEO of the blockchain company Trive, took issue with that comment.""Yes, circumvention of third parties, including government is one of the major uses/cases of Bitcoin,"" he said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, ""but it is precisely because of the failure and overreach of such parties that it was invented.""He added: ""Maybe it's time we stopped relying on third parties, governments and regulators to keep us safe and relied on ourselves.""Also Wednesday, U.S. authorities appeared to tighten the screws on the cryptocurrency.

10,NDAQ,"D.C. news moved markets during the week. The Dow and S&P 500 index hit record highs as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and other financials rallied on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields. Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled.

19,NDAQ,"In an age of light-speed electronic trading, an options exchange is going old school with a plan to let traders conduct business face to face.BOX Options Exchange, which operates an electronic trading venue, plans to add open-outcry trading in Chicago later this year, according to Chief Executive Officer Edward Boyle. The proposal requires regulatory approval.Few exchanges still have trading floors. Most fully operate out of nondescript data centers rather than grand temples of capitalism like the iconic New York Stock Exchange building in Manhattan. One of the biggest exchange operators, CME Group (CME), shut most of its pits last year and plans to close more in the next few months. The options market is an exception, a trend driven by some investors’ preference for the human touch when placing the complicated orders options trading is known for.“There’s still a very good reason for trading floors to exist in options trading to facilitate these complex options trades,” Chicago-based Boyle said in an interview.BOX is one of 14 exchanges in the U.S. equity options market. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has had a trading floor in Chicago since the 1970s, NYSE Group has them in New York and San Francisco, and Nasdaq (NDAQ) operates one in Philadelphia.

34,NDAQ,"Stocks in the trading business have been hot and cold, but iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges (IAI) has smoothed out the fluctuations to show a respectable gain this year.The fund illustrates how a portfolio that combines various elements of an industry can trend higher even while some stocks or segments fall out of favor. Since at least 2017, the ETF has corrected no worse than 10% and it's maintained a moderate uptrend since the November 2016 election sparked a rally in financials and other sectors.So far this year, iShares Broker-Dealers is up 10%, beating the S&P 500. The average annual returns (as of May 31) are 35.1%, 16.8% and 18.8% over the past one, three and five years.The portfolio breaks down into three parts. Investment banking and brokerages make up 72%, while financial exchanges are a 27% weighting. A tiny 1% is in custody banks and asset management firms. This year's performance among those and related industries has varied.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD's specialty financial services industry is up 7%. From that group, the ETF's stocks include exchange operators Nasdaq (NDAQ), CME Group (CME) and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).The investment bankers and brokers group is up 4%. That includes ETF components such as E-Trade Financial (ETFC), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), LPL Financial (LPLA) and the largest holding of the fund, Charles Schwab (SCHW).But IBD's money center banks, which includes Wall Street veterans Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), is down 4%. Shares of those two institutions remain near the lows of their current price consolidations and underperform other holdings.There's been multiple factors influencing the brokerage and exchange companies this year. Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock has yet to recover. Lazard (LAZ) has been basing most of the year.The ETF itself is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 69.49 buy point. But the pattern is shallow and also could be interpreted as a flat base with a 70.68 entry.RELATED:Growth Of Cloud Computing Is Encapsulated In This FundActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexHere's A Way To Invest In FANG Stocks With An ETF

90,NDAQ,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc.’s (MKTX  -  Free Report) revenues have been consistently growing since 2005 (except 2008 when revenues declined just 0.6%). Revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 13% from 2012-2017. This top-line growth was primarily driven by persistent increase in commission (which forms the lion’s share of total revenues) received on trading volumes. The same was up 11.4% in the first quarter of 2018. The company has been successful in increasing its trading volumes by way of inorganic and organic strategies.Its efforts of pursuing international opportunities, a compelling economic market model and a diversified product suite of the coveted U.S. high-grade floating rate and other credit bonds to broaden the scope of volumes growth for MarketAxess, going forward, will further drive commission revenues. The company is also witnessing an uptick in post-trade and services revenues mainly due to MiFID II implementation fees.MarketAxess supplements its organic growth by entering into strategic alliances, or by acquiring businesses or technologies, which enable it to enter new markets, provide new products or services. Some of the notable deals to this end included the acquisition of Xtrakter Limited which provided the company with an expanded set of technology solutions; a strategic alliance with BlackRock, Inc. which improved the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants; agreement with S&P Dow Jones Indices to jointly develop indices that will track the most liquid segments of the U.S. corporate bond market. The company’s inorganic growth which has also aided top-line growth remains impressive.The company has been able to fund its acquisition backed by its strong liquidity position. Notably, it has been generating free cash flow from past several years. Strong liquidity not only mitigates balance-sheet risks, but also paves the way for an accelerated capital deployment in employees, trading platform, new products, geographic expansion and infrastructure.The company remains focused on enhancing shareholders’ value through share buy and dividend hikes. Earlier this year, the company raised dividend by 27%, marking eight consecutive years of dividend hike.While MarketAxess’ growth strategy has led to noticeable increase in the top and bottom line, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 13% on average from 2013-2017, thereby weighing on the company’s margins. In the first quarter of 2018, the same was up 14% year over year. We expect the company’s expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2018, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $220-$232 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 15% year-over-year increase in expenses.Year to date, the stock has gained 1.2%, compared with the industry’s growth of 6.9%. Though this performance pales in comparison with the growth of 18.9%, 13.3%, 5.8% for Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

The bottom line improved 11% year over year.Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. Quote Higher revenues as well as growth across the segments namely Market Services, Information Services and Market Technology supported this upside.

The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $628 million, primarily owing to organic growth of $17 million, a $12-million favorable impact on the back of changes in forex rates and a $7-million impact from acquisitions.Adjusted operating expenses were $341 million in the reported quarter, up 5% from the year-ago figure. This represents a $16-million increase from buyouts and a $7-million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a $6-million organic expense decrease.Nasdaq guided 2018 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.375-$1.415 billion.Segment wise, net revenues at Market Services nudged up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter to $222 million. This upside was driven by improved revenues from cash equity trading, fixed income and commodities trading and clearing and trade management services. However, lower equity derivative trading and clearing revenues limited the upside.Revenues at Corporate Services increased 1.8% year over year to $170 million. This was mainly owing to a rise in Corporate Solutions revenues and Listings Services revenues.Information Services revenues rose 15.6% year over year to $156 million. Higher revenues at Data Products as well as Index Licensing and Services drove the upside.Revenues at Market Technology improved 13% year over year to $87 million on higher change request revenues and software as a service revenues besides a favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Subsequently, in January 2018, Nasdaq’s board members announced another $500 million buyback program, taking the tally to $726 million.Our TakeNasdaq’s results reflect a solid performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and open up cross-selling opportunities into new markets. The top line should also benefit from the company’s consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate non-transaction revenue base including technology, listing and information revenues.Zacks RankNasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

97,NDAQ,"CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of $1.2 billion senior notes. The notes will be issued in two tranches, 3.75% $500 million senior unsecured notes due 2028 and 4.15% $700 million senior unsecured notes due 2048.The company intends to deploy the proceeds from this offering along with cash in hand to finance the cash consideration of NEX Group plc by CME Group and CME London Limited.CNA Financial’s debt-to-equity ratio at first-quarter end was 10.2%, having improved 70 basis points from 2017-end level. With this new issuance, the ratio is expected to deteriorate 530 basis points. Nonetheless, the leverage ratio will still compare favorably with the industry average of 20.6%.However, with the new issuance, interest expense will increase. But we still believe in the company’s strong position to clear debts, banking on operational efficiencies, largely driven by organic growth.Though the interest rate is gradually improving, reflecting the country’s thriving economy, the rate is still low. With the last one-quarter percentage point hike, the interest rate currently stands at 2%. Projections at the June FOMC meeting indicate interest rate to reach 3.4% at 2020 end as GDP grows at 2% and inflation remaining at 2.1% in 2020.It seems a prudent approach on CME Group’s part to capitalize on the persistently low interest rate environment to procure funds. Also, lower interest rate reducing interest burden on borrowings combined with lower tax incidence should facilitate margin expansion.Shares of CME Group have rallied 16.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.9%. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives and a consolidated global presence should drive growth for the company, pushing up its shares. CME Group has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).    Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Nasdaq, Inc.

99,NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 3.92%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Market Services segment, a major contributor to Nasdaq’s total revenues, is expected to have delivered solid numbers banking on backlog, new client wins, and favorable business trends. Higher revenues from International Securities Exchange and European cash equities likely have driven the Market Services’ revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market Services revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $83 million, an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago period.Improved market technology revenues plus listing and information revenues are estimated to boost organic growth in non-transaction revenues.While U.S. equity options volume improved 12.1% year over year to 399 million contracts, revenues per contract were 14 cents and declined 18.8% on a year-over-year basis. European options and futures volumes were 19.8 million contracts in the fourth quarter, down 6.6% year over year. Revenues per contract were 56 cents, up 21.7% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is pegged at $628 million, up 4.8% year over year.However, the company’s expenses might have increased on account of development and diversification of its business. This in turn has also likely restricted the operating margin expansion. For 2017, the company estimates non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $1.28-$1.29 billion.Nasdaq, Inc.

Also, rapidly-changing climatic conditions made a substantial impact across the finance sector. But this New Year 2018 buoys fresh hopes, instilling confidence among investors.The Republican tax plan, passed into law on Dec 22, 2017, marked a huge overhaul of the tax system, slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from the pre-existent 35% effective January 2018. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line as well as boost margins. The tax cut is anticipated to make the finance sector more globally competitive.Also, the economic growth is gaining traction.

On Dec 18, 2017, CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) self-certified the initial listing of its Bitcoin futures contract. Although bitcoin has massive growth prospects, investors also need to be careful about investing in the same.With the global economy raising enough optimism, the Securities and Exchanges industry is sure to benefit from the abovementioned positives. Moreover, a thriving economy is likely to provide enough opportunities to this industry to focus on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service as well as product offerings. This, in turn, will help the industry stay ahead and maintain a competitive streak amid the volatile industry dynamics.The Securities and Exchanges industry is ranked at #6 (in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank for 265+ industries), outperforming the S&P 500 index in a year with a surge of 33.3%.

109,NDAQ,"The excitement surrounding the blockchain technology comes with the astronomical surge in bitcoin price, which soared above $19,000 last month. The blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, which offers a secure, faster and cheaper medium of carrying out online transaction and transfer of information without the need of third-party verification.Now, investors could easily capitalize on this fast-growing technology with the two blockchain ETFs that go live today. Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF BLCN and Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF BLOK are designed to benefit from the booming blockchain technology. The duo is the first ETF targeting the fast-developing world of the blockchain-based technology (read: How to Invest in the Hottest Technologies With ETFs).Inside BLCNThis fund is passively managed and seeks to track the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, a smart-beta benchmark that measures the returns of global companies committing resources for developing, researching, supporting, innovating or utilizing blockchain technology for their proprietary use or for use by others. The index will utilize internal and external research, as well as their proprietary Blockchain Score ranking system.Per the filing, the index will hold 50 to 100 companies with the highest scores and are weighted based on their scores. Information technology is expected to be the top sector for the index, accounting for about 60% of assets, followed by financials (29%) and consumer discretionary (8%). Companies like Overstock (OSTK  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Nasdaq (NDAQ  -  Free Report) and Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will find their entry into the fund’s portfolio (read: Blockchain ETFs: Profit from the Technology Behind Bitcoin).Inside BLOKThis is an actively managed ETF providing investors global exposure to a basket of the leading companies engaged in advancing the blockchain-based technology and other distributed ledger technologies. American firms will dominate about 70% of the portfolio while the rest will go to firms in China, Canada and Japan.Additionally, the top 10 holdings will likely comprise about 45% of the assets with some well-known companies like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Overstock, IBM, Square (SQ  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). This new fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%.How does it fit in today’s portfolio?These ETFs could be an intriguing choice for investors seeking to bet on the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The digital currency was the hottest trade of 2017, having climbed more than 1300% and witnessed wild swings (read: 10 Hottest ETF Themes for 2018).The strong trend is expected to continue this year as bitcoin is now easily available to individuals and businesses with the launch of futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) last month. Additionally, rising institutional investor interest and strong demand from Japan added to the frenzy.While there are some strong critics and fears of bubbles bursting in the digital currency, blockchain technology possesses extraordinary potential to grow in the years to come. This is especially true given the increased adoption of the technology by the largest banking institutions in Asia and the Middle East particularly in payments, as well as cybersecurity firms due to the rise of ransomware attacks.Investing in blockchain technology will likely generate returns as big as today's FAANG stocks. According to a report from Research and Markets, the global blockchain market is expected to witness a CAGR of 61.5% from $210.2 million in 2016 to $2,312.5 million by 2021. Per Gartner, Blockchain is estimated to have delivered $4 billion in business value-add or technology innovation in 2017, and are expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, $176 billion in 2025, and $3.1 trillion by 2030.ETF Competition & Bottom LineThough there aren’t any real competitors to these new products, ETFs offering exposure to the blockchain ecosystem via semiconductor companies that make chips required for bitcoin mining, might pose a threat. The most popular funds include iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report). Both are soaring on the blockchain craze and have AUM of $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).The new funds offer investors a pure play to the blockchain technology that backs cryptocurrencies and has the potential to change the world. The ETFs will no doubt get a first-mover advantage that could help in garnering immense investor interest.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

This represents a decline in organic expense, amounting to $4 million, offset by a $4 million unfavorable impact from changes in forex rates.Notably, the company increased the lower end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.28-$1.29 billion from $1.26-$1.30 billion, guided earlier.Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services rose 4.3% from the year-ago quarter to $581 million. This upside was driven by improved revenues from European cash equities, higher volumes and pricing changes at NFX, increased customer demand for third-party connectivity, co-location and test facilities as well as a favorable impact from changes in forex rates.Revenues at Corporate Services slipped 0.6% year over year to $161 million. This was mainly due to a decline in in U.S. listings revenues due to the run-off of listing of additional shares fees, driven by implementation of the company’s all-inclusive annual fee. An increase in European listing services revenues partially offset the downside.Information Services revenues rose 9.5% year over year to $150 million. Higher shared tape plan revenues and audit collections, as well as higher assets under management in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes, drove the upside.Revenues at Market Technology increased 5.5% year over year to $77 million due to higher change request revenues, along with organic revenue growth in software as a service revenue and a positive impact due to changes in forex rates. However, lower software, licensing and support revenues partially offset the upside. Market Technology order intake totaled $66 million. The Nasdaq Stock Market witnessed 78 new listings during the third quarter, 34 of which were IPOs.Financial UpdateNasdaq had cash and cash equivalents of $530 million as of Sep 30, 2017, up 31.5% from 2016-end level. As of Sep 30, 2017, debt dipped 0.4% over 2016-end level to $3.59 billion.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateThe board of directors approved 38 cents per share quarterly dividend, which will be paid on Dec 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on Dec 15, 2017.During the third quarter, the company bought back shares worth $18 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $255 million remaining under its buyback authorization.Our TakeNasdaq’s results reflect a decent performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and open up cross-selling opportunities into new markets. The top line should also benefit from the company’s consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate non-transaction revenue base, including technology, listing and information revenues.Zacks RankNasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

121,NDAQ,"Despite a cloud of uncertainty looming over the global market environment due to rapidly changing climatic conditions — storming the industrial space with consecutive catastrophic disasters Hurricanes Harvey and Irma — and the palpable disagreement among the Fed officials over how quickly to raise interest rates, the performance of some pivotal players in the Securities and Exchanges industry has shown a ray of hope.Some major players of Securities and Exchanges industry have been successfully recording robust trading volumes and August was no exception.  We expect to see these key players generating solid trading volumes in the near term as well.Momentum to Continue?The key players in the Securities and Exchanges industry are largely dependent on their product and service portfolios to churn out revenues. The major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services. There are other sources of revenues that might include data products, financial indexes, along with information and public company services.In a highly competitive industry, demand is fueled by investor-confidence, dependent on the overall growth of the industry itself. Interestingly, the individual exchanges’ profitability rests on maximization of transaction and clearing fees while keeping transaction-based expenses low. Such organic growth will help the individual exchanges drive their revenues, which in turn will continue to fuel increasing trading volumes. This makes us hopeful for the future, which has a high possibility to see major players in the industry generating substantially high trading volumes.This apart, the individual exchanges rely heavily on their diverse product offerings to drive their overall growth. With introduction of new products, which not only cater to the demands of the derivatives industry but also complement the core product lines, the key players are expected to strengthen their market position and global reach. To that end, the companies remain committed toward investing in new product extensions and offerings to boost overall growth, thereby creating an opportunity for trading volumes to thrive.The individual exchanges are focused on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service and product offerings to help them stay ahead and maintain the competitive streak amid the changing industry dynamics.Interestingly, some leading players in the industry have been making substantial efforts to expand product portfolio via prudent acquisitions, which in turn will aid them to retain their market share, expand product lines as well as widen global footprint. For instance, the acquisition of Bats Global Markets by CBOE Holdings on Feb 28, 2017, has enabled the latter to broaden and diversify its product portfolio.Also, on Jul 5, 2017, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has purchased the remaining 20% stake in ICE Endex shares from N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie. The buyout adds capabilities to Intercontinental Exchange’s European gas and power portfolio.We wait to see if new product initiatives and global presence help these major players in the Securities and Exchanges industry to post high trading volumes in the future.The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is currently ranked at #105 (which lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries). Notably, the industry has outperformed the broader market year to date, evident from a gain of 17.3% compared with the S&P 500’s increase of 11.2%.Stocks in FocusFollowing are some key stocks which have exhibited robust trading volumes in August, witnessed upward estimate revisions and their respective share prices have also the industry, quarter to date:CBOE Holdings, Inc.

124,NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect the company’s Market Services segment, a major contributor to Nasdaq’s total revenues, to not only boost top-line growth but also improve the company’s overall performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Higher revenues from the buyout of International Securities Exchange (ISE) and European cash equities are expected to lead to an improvement in Market Services’ revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market Services revenues is currently pegged at $147 million, an increase of 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.The aforementioned segment is likely to have delivered positive organic growth, primarily driven by a solid market share performance across its largest trading categories — U.S. options, U.S. equities and European equities, together with continued positive organic growth in Trade Management Services.Even though the company has been displaying weak equity trading performance over a considerable period of time, Nasdaq’s organic growth has seen a consistent rise. Therefore, the company has likely delivered noticeable organic growth in the quarter to be reported, driven by its strategy of expediting the non-transaction revenue base that includes market technology, listing and information revenues.However, the company is likely to have incurred higher expenses in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to development and diversification of its business. This in turn has likely restricted operating margin expansion.Additionally, the company might witness lower cash equity trading revenues, owing to decrease in revenue per contract and a weak trading activity in the industry, along with regulatory changes and adverse forex impact may lead to lower cash equity trading revenues. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net cash equity trading revenues is currently pegged at $60 million, reflecting a slip of 1.6% from the prior-year quarter. Decreased cash equity trading revenues can weigh on the bottom-line of the company.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Nasdaq has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Nasdaq has an Earnings ESP of +0.49%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.03 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The positive ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 along with a positive Earnings ESP, have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are as follows:Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 1 with an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The interest has been pegged at three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 0.4% per annum.The company intends to utilize the net proceeds along with cash in hand and borrowings under the company’s senior credit facility or through issuances of commercial paper to finance its eVestment buyout as well as the expenses associated with it.  Nasdaq will also utilize the funds for general corporate purposes if the eVestment acquisition does not materialize.

136,NDAQ,"Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) has announced that it will buy eVestment for $705 million. The transaction is expected to culminate in the fourth quarter of 2017. The acquisition will help Nasdaq boost its global information services business. The company will fund the acquisition through cash and debt.Acquisition RationaleeVestment is an industry leading content and analytics provider. Asset managers, investment consultants and asset owners use its 2,800 individual data points on more than 74,000 investment vehicles for decision making.  eVestment boasts client base of 2,000 including 92% of the top asset managers, 76% of the top consulting firms and 80% of the top 20 pension funds.eVestment along with Nasdaq’s surveillance technology, SMARTS, Analytics Hub and Mutual Fund Quotation Service operations will help the acquirer expand buy side relationships. This move reflects Nasdaq’s strategic initiatives to grow by diversifying its business beyond hosting stock trading.Addition of eVestment will ensure revenue and cash flow generation, apart from cushioning solid growth for Nasdaq that in turn will also enhance the acquirer’s shareholder returns.  On the other hand, eVestment stands to gain from Nasdaq’s global presence. Per Jim Minnick, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, eVestment has its business boomed 12% annually since 2013. Leveraging Nasdaq’s information services offerings, eVestment can also boost its capabilities to serve clients better.Nasdaq expects this acquisition to help generate double-digit shareholder returns. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) securities exchange intends to lower leverage while focusing on capital deployment by increasing dividend and pursuing share buybacks.Impressive Inorganic Growth StoryNasdaq has grown meaningfully over the years through a number of strategic expansions. Acquisition of Chi-X Canada aided Nasdaq to gain direct access to the Canadian equities market. Marketwired and Boardvantage acquisitions fortified its Corporate Solutions business while International Securities Exchange expanded its technology offering. Nasdaq identified between $10 million and $20 million as additional synergies to be realized once platform transitions conclude.Earlier in July, Nasdaq had agreed to purchase Sybenetix to ramp up its buy-side product offerings.Nasdaq’s shares have gained 4.0% quarter to date, outperforming the 0.6% increase of the industry. Strategic initiatives undertaken by the company to feed its product and service capabilities, which in turn fuel growth, should continue to drive the shares higher.Players in the securities and exchange industry have been facing severe competition as increased market consolidation tends to reduce market share and leverage rate of business. Hence, strategic takeovers like the one mentioned above are expected to help the securities exchange retain its market space.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (AFH  -  Free Report), Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) and Mercury General Corporation (MCY  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

137,NDAQ,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) has recently completed the buyout of London-based startup Sybenetix, an industry-leading surveillance provider that brings together behavioral analytics and cognitive computing offering financial markets expertise. The acquisition will not only help Nasdaq expand market technology business but also enable the securities exchange to improve its market surveillance techniques.Details of the TransactionNasdaq inked the deal to acquire Sybenetix on Jul 25, 2017. However, the securities exchange has not disclosed the purchase price of the transaction but aims to fund the same with cash in hand. Notably, the buyout marks the first transaction since the appointment of Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer of Nasdaq.Benefits of the AcquisitionThe takeover will allow Nasdaq to extend its current market surveillance technology to ultimately help the securities exchange further strengthen and expand position in the surveillance space, thereby enabling the company to become a leading provider to the buy-side industry. Hence, the transaction will permit the company to invest more into advanced technologies like cognitive computing, which is a very important part of the company’s strategy. Thus, the securities exchange will be able to further improve its service portfolio to boost overall results and result in long-term growth.With this transaction, Nasdaq will be able to fulfill its primary objective of making an entry into the buy-side market with a compliance solution. Also, the buyout will help enhance the company’s risk management solutions, as Sybenetix will assist compliance officers at asset management firms to help detect market abuse by analyzing the traders’ behavior. This will be made possible by using an advanced technology, referred to as artificial intelligence.Additionally, the buyout will aid Nasdaq in creating solutions to provide data analysis that will venture beyond trading records to better identify conduct risk.Amid a volatile market environment, increasing competition and regulatory changes, Nasdaq has diversified its operations beyond traditional exchange businesses. This move mainly came due to lower profitability of equity trading over the past decade. Also, expansion of market technology will significantly contribute to the company’s overall growth. Thus, the acquisition is anticipated to boost company’s prosperity in the near future.On the other hand, Sybenetix will benefit from using Nasdaq’s platform to draw massive growth opportunities for its surveillance technologies. In turn, the company will expedite new product development for the buy-side industry.Interestingly, Nasdaq has been boosting its inorganic growth by making prudent acquisitions. To that end, on Sep 5, 2017, the company agreed to acquire eVestment for $705 million. The transaction is expected to culminate in the fourth quarter of 2017. The acquisition will help Nasdaq boost its global information services business.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Nasdaq have gained 5.0% quarter to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.9%. We expect both bottom line and top line growth, solid segmental performance, strategic initiatives and a robust capital position to drive the shares higher in the immediate term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are CNO Financial Group, Inc.

142,NDAQ,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX  -  Free Report), a provider of electronic trading network for the institutional market in U.S. credit products.While MarketAxess’ growth strategy has led to noticeable top and bottom-line growth, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 11% on average from 2013-2016, thereby weighing on the company’s margins and by 6.4% in the first half of 2017.We estimate the company’s expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2017, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $192-$208 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 12% year-over-year increase in expenses.Over the past six months, shares of MarketAxess have returned 3% underperforming the gain of 8.5% logged by the industry. It also fared poorly compared with returns of 22.2%, 10.4% and 7.4% for CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report), Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) and Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report), respectively. Given the headwinds faced by the company, its shares are expected to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.10 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.5% on higher trading volumes. Also, the bottom line improved 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, MarketAxess's valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s one-forward price-to-earnings ratio, investors might not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 49 which is above its median range of 40. It is also higher than the one-year forward P/E ratio of 24.12 for the industry and 19.56 for the S&P 500.MarketAxess carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.76%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterNasdaq is likely to report bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher revenues and better-than-expected performance across all the segments. Also, continued share buybacks should have boosted its bottom line.  The securities exchange’s net revenue growth can be attributable to net revenues from the company’s 2016 acquisitions of ISE, Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, along with organic growth in the non-trading segments.Further, the company has likely achieved a substantial amount of annualized run rate cost synergies across the aforementioned four 2016 acquisitions. Notably, the securities exchange is anticipated to deliver on the full synergy potential of $60 million by the end of 2017.  However, Nasdaq has likely reported increased operating expenses in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.With respect to the surprise trend, the company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.31%.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nasdaq is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.
