0,VTR,"Despite the likelihood that interest rates will continue to inch higher, real estate exchange traded funds are climbing back from a late-April dip.Real estate investment trusts offer high yields and tend to fare well when interest rates are low. But as rates rise, investors often move out of REITs and into the perceived safety of bonds.The top three real estate ETFs based on year-to-date performance have outperformed the broader market, represented by the S&P 500 and its 8% gain. The top two funds are mortgage plays.VanEck Vectors Mortgage REIT Income (MORT) led with a 12.2% gain, based on its YTD return through May 23. The ETF found support near its 50-day moving average and rebounded off the line this week, giving investors a follow-on opportunity to add shares. The ETF is about 2% above the line. MORT rose 8% from a March breakout past a 23.03 flat-base buy point. The $147 million fund tracks the Market Vectors Global Mortgage REITs Index. Top holdings include Annaly Capital Management (NLY), a real estate investment trust that rose 17% this year through May 23, and AGNC Investment (AGNC), up 13% for the period. Two Harbors Investment (TWO), IBD's top-ranked mortgage REIT by Composite Rating (85), advanced 15%.No. 2 in the chart below is iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped (REM), also with a 12.2% YTD gain. The $1.35 billion fund tracks the FTSE Nareit All Mortgage Capped Index. The same three stocks are among REM's top five holdings as well.Long-Term Care ETF (OLD) came in a close third with a 12.1% advance for the year. The ETF, launched by Janus last year on June 8, has attracted nearly $8 million in assets. It's thinly traded, with an average daily volume north of 1,000 shares. OLD tracks the Solactive Long-Term Care Index, which is made up of companies poised to profit from providing long-term care to the elderly.Ventas (VTR), a REIT that owns and leases senior housing and health-care-related properties in the U.S., accounted for about one-fifth of the fund's portfolio as of May 23. Shares were up 8% through that date. Welltower (HCN), another REIT in the same business, made up nearly 20%. Shares were up 9%.Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET), which tracks the performance of the highest-yielding global real estate investment trusts, came in fourth with a 7.5% YTD return. The fund, which has gathered $37 million in assets, is working on the handle to a saucer-shaped base. The buy point is 15.52, or 10 cents above the handle's high. SRET advanced 10% after clearing a prior saucer with handle in July. Annaly Capital, AGNC Investment and Two Harbors Investment were among the fund's top holdings.All four of ETFs pay a dividend well above the S&P 500's 1.92%. MORT offers 7.1% annualized payout, REM 9%, OLD 3%, and SRET 7.5%.RELATED:With Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And Appeal Which New Dividend Stock ETF Is Best For You?
"
1,VTR,"2016 has been a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde year for real estate investment trusts. A pleasant first half of the year turned into a nasty second half as interest rate jitters fueled selling in the sector.Starting in late July, IBD's property REIT group, long known as a safe-haven play, pulled back nearly 16%, putting the sector pretty much in bear-market territory.
"
2,VTR,"But don't give up on REITs just yet. The group, known for the stocks' hefty dividend yields, has bounced up 8% from its Nov. 11 low, and analysts and fund managers point toward an improving economy as a catalyst in coming quarters.
"
3,VTR,"An individual investor might ask: Why would I want to invest in REITs to generate income in a higher interest-rate environment?
"
4,VTR,"It's a valid question because higher interest rates raise debt-financing costs, and REITs are known for carrying debt due to their acquisitive nature.

6,VTR,"Ask investment professionals the question and you get this answer: REITs can do quite well in a rising interest rate environment, so long as rates are going up as a result of a strengthening economy. That seems to be the case now.
"
7,VTR,"Edward Mui, a Morningstar equity research analyst specializing in REITs, still likes the fundamental outlook for REITs, particularly in areas like health care properties, shopping centers and apartments.
"
8,VTR,"According to Mui, senior housing REITs still have an aging population working in their favor, and a shift toward private pay sources insulates them from potential changes to the Affordable Care Act as a result of Donald Trump's presidential win. He follows names like HCP Inc. (HCP), Welltower (HCN) and Ventas (VTR). All three boast annualized dividend yields of around 5%. They're all more than 20% off recent 52-week highs.

"
14,VTR,"John Snowden, portfolio manager at Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund (RREDX), has a third of his fund invested in REITs, another third in real estate credit and the final third in real estate private equity. The fund's objective is to provide a 6% annual return to shareholders with more modest capital appreciation of 2-3%.
"
15,VTR,"Snowden's fund is an interval fund with around $200 million under management. Interval funds have been around for four to five years and have been growing in popularity due to low volatility. Rather than provide daily liquidity like a normal mutual fund, the fund offers quarterly liquidity.

18,VTR,"At the end of the third quarter, Snowden's top-weighted REIT holdings included Communications Sales & Leasing (CSAL), Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT) and New Residential Investment (NRZ). The latter two offer big yields of 8% and 12%, respectively. But keep in mind that such lofty yields generally come with higher risk.
"
19,VTR,"Calvin Schnure expects to see continued fundamental strength in the REIT sector.
"
20,VTR,"Calvin Schnure, senior vice president of research and economic analysis at NAREIT, noted that the current situation for REITs is similar to 2004 when the Fed embarked on a series of rate hikes. Rates had been low for a long period of time, inflation was contained and the Fed was ready to normalize rates. REITs initially weakened but eventually outperformed the S&P 500 in double-digit terms over the subsequent two to three years of rate hikes by the Fed.
"
21,VTR,"As for REITs' ability to outperform in 2017, Schnure noted that while there's some uncertainty about how President-elect Trump's policies will unfold, it shouldn't affect underlying strong fundamentals in the sector.
"
22,VTR,"""The commercial real estate expansion cycle should continue for some time, there are no signs of overbuilding and the U.S. economy doesn't look vulnerable. All the ingredients are in place for a good year ahead,"" he said.
"
23,VTR,"Schnure also points toward reasonable valuations in the REIT sector. ""The price-to-FFO ratio is in the lower half of what the range has been for the past half-decade. This is not an overvalued sector at all,"" he said.
"
24,VTR,"Schnure also pointed out a recent NAREIT-sponsored study by Wilshire Associates regarding income-oriented retirement planning. Research from Wilshire Funds Management based on portfolio optimizations using 40 years of investment return data through 2015 showed that adding high income-generating assets like REITs to a traditional retirement portfolio could boost income returns by nearly 40%, while providing similar total returns and no increase in risk.
"
25,VTR,"IBD'S TAKE:
"
26,VTR,"Many property REITs in IBD's database are trying to put in a bottom after modest pullbacks, but others are showing resilience and holding near highs, with compelling charts.
"
27,VTR,"Savvy income investors should look for renewed signs of accumulation, or institutional buying, in the group. During the week ended Nov. 11, the group reversed higher, rising 1%. Volume was heavy, and it closed in the upper half of its  weekly range. That was a sign of support from institutional buyers. The group still has some potential resistance (selling pressure) to work through, so more weekly price gains on above-average volume would help the group's cause.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average also turned higher in the afternoon, with the S&P 500 up 0.4% and the Dow 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.6% advance. Volume was running lower on the NYSE but modestly higher on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session.Conservative stocks struggled. The Dow Jones utility average retreated 0.2%. On IBD's Big Cap 20, which currently features many conservative dividend stocks, growth plays were beating the income stocks.Of the day's top four gainers in the Big Cap 20 -- Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- none pay dividends. Edwards Lifesciences rose 3%, while Ulta Beauty, Boston Scientific and Intuitive Surgical climbed about 1%.Meanwhile, the worst performers were dividend payers, such as AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and real estate investment trust Ventas (VTR). Each of the three feature annualized dividend yields of 4% or more. AT&T, Verizon and Ventas all had hit record highs in recent days as post-Brexit defensive plays.While bulls welcomed the shift to more growth-oriented stocks, there was no way to know if this represented a change or if it was merely a one-day, minor adjustment.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 1.38% after hitting record lows earlier%.

38,VTR,"A decline in the growth rate is never welcome, but it doesn’t always spell the end.Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR), a July 2013 IPO, endured four quarters of growth deceleration last year. Funds from operations ended 2014 with a 65% increase vs. the year-earlier quarter, but then slowed to 5% in Q1. After that, quarterly FFO declined 14%, 5% and 25% in the ensuing periods.FFO is considered a better gauge of a REIT’s cash performance than earnings.For the full-year 2015, FFO dropped 11%.The stock's price action painted a different picture. Rexford declined 20% in the first eight months of the year but then rallied 30% in the final four months of 2015.Year to date, the stock is up almost 5% vs. a 2% drop for its Finance-Property REIT group and a 9% retreat for the Nasdaq.Wall Street expects Rexford’s FFO to grow 9% this year and 10% next year, which is probably what accounts for Rexford’s positive performance.Will Rexford’s outperformance continue in 2016?Two things suggest that might be tough.First, the turnaround from 2015 is probably already priced into the stock.Second, the market has assumed a more aggressive stance lately. Since the market’s short-term low Feb. 11, the small-cap S&P 600 has jumped 9%. Rexford is up 5% in the same period. Still, the market could lose its aggressive edge and start rewarding defensive plays again.Even if the market’s next turn is back to defense, it’s reasonable to wonder if something else in the REIT space -- not necessarily an IPO -- might offer a better profile than Rexford does.In the current uptrend, as young as it is, some REITs are showing strong action.Nine stocks in IBD's property REIT group are up more than 10% since Feb. 11. Four are health care plays: Welltower (HCN), up 20%; Ventas (VTR), 16%; National Health Investor (NHI), up 12%; and Universal Health Realty (UHT).The problem: All are well off their highs, and two are thinly traded.Among the top-rated stocks in the group, CoreSite Realty (COR), a 2010 IPO, is No. 2 in the IBD 50.

"
41,VTR,"Are IRA investors about to get shut out from a way to own malls, office buildings, apartments and other commercial properties? Big changes could be coming for an asset category known as nontraded real estate investment trusts.Nontraded REITs are direct-investment products sometimes held by small or ""mom and pop"" investors. These property-owning vehicles have attracted significant money, but also criticism over risk.Like publicly traded REITs, nontraded ones report to the Securities and Exchange Commission and pay out 90% of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unlike publicly traded REITs, nontraded REITs aren't listed on a stock exchange and have no market for their securities — but that's a characteristic shielding the investments from market swings, proponents say.Now a Labor Department proposal seeking to eliminate conflicts of interest by rewriting how investment advice is provided could essentially make nontraded REITs off-limits to qualified retirement accounts.REITs That Rely On IRAsIRAs accounted for 43% of the $21.1 billion that was invested in nontraded REITs and other direct-investment products in 2014, according to the Investment Program Association (IPA), a Washington-based trade group representing the direct-investment industry. The organization estimates that about 2.8 million retirement accounts have holdings in direct investments, and that in 2014 investors in those products received nearly $6 billion in distributions, or about 7% of total assets invested.Among other consequences, the Labor Department proposal's enactment would impede portfolio diversification for retirement savers, says Kevin Hogan, the CEO of IPA.""We're certainly supportive of the desire to improve the retirement landscape generally,"" he said. ""But we think that there are a lot of individuals who are investing in nontraded REITs that will no longer have access to them. It's real money that people are putting to work in medical facilities, malls and other commercial properties that clearly could be impacted.""Longstanding criticism of nontraded REITs has generally focused on illiquidity and hefty loads. A consultant with Fairfax, Va.-based Securities Litigation & Consulting Group estimates that nontraded REIT shareholders were about $50 billion worse off than investors in REITs on the public exchanges over two decades, according to Reuters. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) cautions that nontraded REIT shareholders may not recoup their entire investment at liquidation.The Labor Department proposal, released in April with the White House's encouragement, would require advisors to assume the role of a fiduciary — in other words, to put a client's interest ahead of their own — when receiving commissions or other compensation by selling direct investments to qualified retirement plans. Critics of the proposal charge that the rule would require advisors to charge a flat fee for services, which would prove too costly for small retirement accounts. That would leave small retail investors without guidance, they argue.Suitability StandardCurrently, advisors must adhere to a suitability standard, defined as a reasonable belief that investment recommendations are in the client's best interests based on financial needs, objectives and circumstances. Among arguments in support of the new rules, a White House Council of Economic Advisors analysis found that conflicts of interest accounted for annual losses of 1 percentage point ""for affected investors — or about $17 billion per year in total,"" according to the Labor Department.Although some broker-dealers and insurance agents are allowed to receive traditional compensation under the proposal, the rule excludes direct-investment products from the list of assets that qualify for such an exemption.Including nontraded REITs in the list would at least allow advisors selling the products to largely operate as they do today, albeit with more costs and hoops to jump through, says John Harrison, CEO of the Alternative and Direct Investment Securities Association, an Indianapolis-based trade group.""We think this is a bad idea because it really is going to limit the amount of investment products that the small to average investor can get into,"" he said.How Nontraded REITs WorkInvestors buy nontraded REITs via broker-dealers and advisors for a typical price of $10 a share, which then can include upfront commissions and fees of around 12%.While in certain circumstances nontraded REIT shareholders may redeem or sell a limited amount of stock after a holding period, the REITs generally aim to liquidate in seven to 10 years through a sale or a stock exchange listing. Healthcare REIT Ventas (VTR) acquired American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust for $2.6 billion shortly after the latter listed on the Nasdaq last year, for example. And American Realty Capital Global Trust listed on the NYSE earlier this month as Global Net Lease (GNL), with a market capitalization of about $1.4 billion.The rule-change proposal has generated more than 2,000 comment letters since its April release, and the Labor Department plans to hold hearings in August followed by another comment period. It's the second fiduciary proposal the Labor Department has made — its first attempt was in 2010 — and observers expect the agency to try to finalize the rule before President Obama leaves office in 2017.In addition to nontraded REITs, direct investment products include business development companies (BDCs), which pool money to invest in small-, developing- and middle-market companies.While both are geared toward providing investors with income, nontraded REITs account for the lion's share of assets under management — roughly $125 billion of the $140 billion raised by direct investment strategies since 2000, according to IPA.Nontraded REIT sponsors could see their ability to raise billions of dollars in capital erode if the proposal stands as written. Inland Real Estate Investment, CNL Financial Group, NorthStar Asset Management Group (NSAM) and other sponsors have raised some $67 billion since 2010 alone, according to Shrewsbury, N.J.-based Robert A. Stanger & Co., a real estate investment bank focused on the industry.Like IPA, sponsors have submitted comments to the Labor Department asking that it include direct investment products in its list of assets qualifying for an exemption.They note that other regulatory changes promote transparency, including a rule that, beginning next April, will require the REITs to account for the upfront costs when valuing their securities. Plus, state regulators, the SEC and FINRA have long regulated nontraded REITs, broker-dealers and advisors that sell shares in the vehicles, they add.Regardless of what happens, retail investors will find a way to own real estate, says Scott Smith, president of FactRight, in Eden Prairie, Minn. It conducts due diligence on sponsors and securities offerings.""The moral of this story is that alternative investments aren't a fad, and commercial real estate is a proven alternative asset to achieve certain objectives in retail portfolios,"" he said.

63,VTR,"'Inexorably Increasing'
"
64,VTR,"Health care real estate executives say that concerns about an oversupply of senior housing are overblown. Large REITs such as Ventas are better able to withstand issues in certain markets and lines of business because of their size and geographic diversity.

72,VTR,"""Supply is a concern, but this demographic wave is real,"" Goltra said.
"
73,VTR,"While construction slipped in the first quarter, the decrease may have been related to weather, the National Investment Center said last month. Construction as a percentage of inventory has hovered at more than 3% in the past year, a rate unmatched since the first quarter of 2009.
"
74,VTR,"""There's a lot of people that have begun to develop now,"" Gehl said. ""You're seeing lots of shovels going into the ground now.""Real estate developers are betting big on U.S. housing for the elderly, preparing for a surge in demand as the population of senior citizens almost doubles in the next 35 years. They may be building too fast.A jump in supply is forecast to cut growth in senior-housing net operating income from 3.3% this year to 1.8% in 2015 and 1.4% in 2016, according to Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm. The increase may hurt health care real estate investment trusts (REITs) and companies including Brookdale Senior Living (BKD) of Brentwood, Tenn., which is buying competitor Emeritus (ESC) for about $1.4 billion to become the biggest owner of senior properties, Green Street says.""Increased supply is always worrisome in any type of commercial real estate,"" said Jim Sullivan, a managing director at Newport Beach, Calif.-based Green Street. ""In senior housing, new construction has ramped up considerably over the last two years.""Health care REITs, which soared to records early last year, have been the worst-performing part of the property-trust market in the past 12 months. The U.S. had 526,144 senior-housing units in the 31 largest markets in the first quarter, up 1.4% from a year earlier, and an additional 16,181 units are under construction, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry, a trade group based in Annapolis, Md.Stock DeclineThe Bloomberg health care REIT index has fallen 18% in the past 12 months, compared with a 4.7% decline for the broader Bloomberg REIT index. The companies, which were trading at large premiums to their net asset values, have been hurt over concern about a narrowing of the spread between their capital costs and property prices, said Ian Goltra, a money manager at Forward Management in San Francisco.Building and owning housing for the elderly have become more popular as baby boomers age. The population of people 65 and older is projected to surge to 83.7 million in 2050 from 43.1 million in 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau said this month. Baby boomers — those born between mid-1946 and mid-1964 — began turning age 65 in 2011.Housing for the elderly varies greatly. Independent-living communities serve those who need little assistance with daily living, and sometimes include meals and activities, Brookdale's website shows. At assisted-living properties, residents usually receive help with bathing, dressing, transportation and medication management, according to the Assisted Living Federation of America, a senior-housing trade group based in Alexandria, Va.Walking PathSome properties have a mix of services.One example is the Hallmark, a high-rise on Chicago's lakefront north of downtown that offers independent- and assisted-living options.

76,VTR,"Outfront Media, Inc. (OUT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 60 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. Further, the figure came in higher than the year-ago quarter tally of 56 cents.Results indicate higher local sales across billboard and transit, benefit from acquired digital billboards in Canada as well as the conversion of static billboards to digital.Revenues for the quarter came in at $401.3 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $404.7 million. However, revenues rose 1% from the year-ago figure.For full-year 2017, adjusted FFO per share came in at $2.00, 6.1% lower than the year-ago figure of $2.13. Nonetheless, revenues for the full year came in at $1.52 billion, up nearly 0.4% from $1.51 billion reported in 2016.Quarter in DetailBillboard revenues of $276.4 million in the quarter indicated a marginal year-over-year decrease of $0.1 million. Results were primarily affected by a drop in average revenue per day (yield) and the net impact of new and lost billboards in the period. However, these were partially offset by an increase in revenues from the conversion of digital billboards and acquisition of digital billboards in Canada.Transit and other revenues of $124.9 million increased 3.3% from the prior-year quarter. This was due to the net impact of franchises that were won and lost in the period, partly offset by a decrease in yield.Operating expenses of $217.4 million inched up 1% year over year, mainly due to higher transit franchise expenses relating to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority transit contract, impact from the acquisition of digital billboards in Canada and elevated expenses associated with the Sports Marketing operating segment. These were offset to some extent by lower transit franchise expenses under the terms of the new transit franchise agreement with New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization inched up 3.3% year over year to $121.1 million.Net cash flow resulting from operating activities for the year ending Dec 31, 2017, came in at $249.3 million, down from $287.1 million recorded in the comparable period last year. Results were affected primarily due to the lower net income as adjusted for non-cash items and the timing of payments made under the MTA agreement.As of Dec 31, 2017, Outfront Media’s liquidity position comprised cash of $48.3 million, as well as $341.4 million of availability under its $430.0 revolving credit facility, net of $88.6 million of issued letters of credit against the revolving credit facility.Our TakeOutfront Media is making diligent efforts to expand its digital display portfolio. It has resorted to acquisitions, swaps and conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays to focus on this low-cost out-of-home (OOH) platform. These strategic efforts bode well for its long-term growth. Also, the company is strengthening its technology platform to grow its client base and leverage on the fragmented OOH industry. Further, its huge diversity, both industry and geographical wise, makes its revenues less volatile.However, the dreary environment in the national advertising market remains a risk. Also, seasonality of business and dependence on the prospects of advertisers are the challenges for the company. Interest rate hikes add to its woes.Performance of Other REITsHere are a few other REIT companies that have reported their fourth quarter 2017 results in February 2018.Ventas, Inc.

However, the figure came in 9.4%, higher than $1.39 recorded in the prior-year quarter. The rise on a year-over-year basis stemmed from higher NOI, reduced general and administrative expenses and savings from lower preferred distributions.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

These efforts also help raise advertising rates. In fact, the company holds significant market share in the U.S. outdoor advertising business, which is encouraging.Nonetheless, the gloomy environment in the national advertising market remains a concern for the company.

78,VTR,"Healthcare REIT, Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) accomplished the sale of its 36 Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) during 2017, which were operated by Kindred Healthcare. The move was in sync with the company’s strategy of “de-emphasis” of this particular healthcare real estate category. However, concentration risks associated with dependence on few tenants, intense competition with national and local operators and any rise in interest rate are concerning Ventas.Early in February, Ventas reported in-line results for fourth-quarter 2017. Results reflected an improved property performance and accretive investments.Notably, Ventas reaped $700 million in proceeds by completing the sale of its 36 SNFs. Amid healthcare reforms, though seniors housing, medical office buildings and hospitals have been able to record solid top-line growth in recent years. However, skilled nursing facilities are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure. The company efficiently spun-off majority of its SNF business in 2015 and following the sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs, Ventas successfully brought down its net operating income (NOI) from SNFs to just 1% of its aggregate NOI.Nonetheless, as a large portion of Ventas’ revenues originates from a few tenants, it is still exposed to concentration risks.  If one of these larger tenants runs into financial difficulty, the company’s earnings could be hurt. The properties managed by Atria and Sunrise constitute a significant portion of its revenues and operating income. Though Atria and Sunrise are managers and not tenants of the company’s properties, adverse developments in their business and affairs or financial conditions could hamper its profitability.Further, Ventas operates in a cut-throat market and competes with national and local healthcare operators on a number of factors, including quality, price and range of services provided, reputation, location and demographics of the population in the surrounding area as well as the financial condition of its tenants and operators. This significantly limits its power to drive its top line as well as cracking deals at attractive rates.Additionally, hike in the interest rate is a concern for Ventas, particularly considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets. Properties under long-term triple-net leases generally have fixed-rental rates, which are subject to annual escalations. However, many of the company’s debt obligations bear floating rates with interest and related payments rates, varying with the movement of LIBOR, bankers’ acceptance or other indexes.Therefore, any rise in the interest rate is likely to raise the cost of debt, which in turn, is expected to adversely affect the profitability of the company. In addition, rising rates increase the cost of financing acquisitions, investment and development-activity costs and also lowers the amount that third parties are ready to pay for the company’s assets at disposal.Ventas currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). In the past three months, shares of the company have underperformed the industry. While the stock has declined 20.9%, the industry has lost 10.4% during this period.

This included $223 million in acquisitions/joint ventures, $108 million in development funding as well as $3 million in loans. Notably, the company completed 80% of these investments with present relationships.On the other hand, the company accomplished total dispositions of $142 million in the quarter.

Furthermore, it extinguished secured debt of $137 million during the reported quarter.Welltower generated proceeds of about $89 million with an average price of $67.06 under the ATM and DRIP programs.2018 OutlookWelltower has provided guidance for 2018. The company expects normalized FFO per share in the range of $3.95–$4.05. Also, the company anticipates its same-store NOI growth to remain in the range of 1-2%.Further, in sync with the strategic repositioning of its premier healthcare portfolio, the company expects 2018 disposition to be around $1.3 billion.Our TakeWelltower is set to acquire a portfolio of four rental continuing care retirement communities CCRCs and convert those to a RIDEA structure. Further, it has secured a major institutional investor for the development of an assisted-living and memory-care community in midtown Manhattan.Although these moves fortify its healthcare asset portfolio, increase in the supply of seniors’ housing assets in certain markets remains a pressure point. It curbs landlords’ pricing power and also limits any robust occupancy growth.Additionally, the rate hike is a concern for the company because of its high exposure to long-term leased assets.

82,VTR,"We are in the heart of the first-quarter earnings season and 154 members of the S&P 500 index have already reported their financial numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.4% increase in total earnings on 10.3% higher revenues compared to the prior-year period. The beat ratio is impressive, with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 72.1% outperforming top-line projections.In fact, the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity, and Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and New Residential Investment Corp. (NRZ  -  Free Report) are set to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 27.With underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns for this industry. In fact, healthcare REITs are most sensitive to spiking interest rates, courtesy long-term leases and narrow re-leasing spreads. Also, taking into consideration high dividend yield, healthcare REITs have comparatively higher correlation with the 10-year US Treasury yield and perform poorly relative to other REIT sectors in a rising interest rate scenario. While there are pockets of strengths in this sector, like strong demand stemming from favorable demographics, oversupply in senior housing facilities and tilt toward outpatient care remain immediate concerns. Further, operators of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have been disadvantages, thanks to the fall in private-pay healthcare, low margins and heavy government control. Deteriorating fundamentals of this sector also remain headwinds.Retail REITs are facing a different set of challenges. Recent data from real estate research firm — Reis — states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies persisted at the 10% levels for first-quarter 2018. Additionally, mall traffic continues to suffer as e-commerce has been increasingly capturing market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, compelling retailers to resort to online options or file bankruptcy. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.In addition, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and curbs growth in demand. Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from the above mentioned REITs.Simon Property has been quickly adapting to the changing retail landscape by increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies and overhauling properties. Importantly, the company is entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its customers. It has also re-launched its brand and marketing programs, and has resorted to micro-retail modeling as well. Such moves make its shopping malls appealing and are expected to have been conducive to revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, during the quarter, Simon Property improved its financial strength by amending and extending its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. This, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity. Increased financial flexibility supports the company’s active redevelopment and expansion pipeline.

Also, Ventas accomplished the sale of its 36 skilled nursing facilities (SNF), which were being operated by Kindred Health care. The move helped it reap $700 million in proceeds and enabled the company to “de-emphasize” this particular healthcare real estate category.Nonetheless, impact of oversupply in some markets might reflect in the performance of Ventas’ senior housing assets. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $204 million for triple net-leased rental income underscores a sequential decline from the prior-quarter figure of $205 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for office building and other services revenues is $3.83 million, highlighting a 1.8% decline sequentially.

83,VTR,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the market opens. The company’s revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to witness a year-over-year decline.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT delivered in-line results. The results reflected improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.73% in the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsVentas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from increasing healthcare spending and aging population. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of citizens with more than 85 years of age is estimated to reach 8.7 million by 2030.In addition, Ventas is focusing on achieving an optimum mix of healthcare real estate assets. The company has made sound efforts to expand its portfolio in the university-based life science and medical office businesses. Such investments will likely help the company capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Also, Ventas accomplished the sale of its 36 skilled nursing facilities (SNF), which were operated by Kindred Health care. The move helped it reap $700 million in proceeds. The move is in sync with Ventas’ strategy of “de-emphasis” of this particular healthcare real estate category. Notably, though seniors housing, medical office buildings and hospitals have been able to record solid revenue growth in recent years, amid healthcare reforms, SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure. The company efficiently spun-off majority of its SNF business in 2015 and following the sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs, Ventas successfully brought down its net operating income from SNFs. Thus, such moves are anticipated to support the company’s operating margin in the quarter under review.Nonetheless, oversupply in some markets is likely to burden the performance of Ventas’ senior housing assets. Since this curtails landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, we expect the prevalent oversupply situation to impact the company’s first-quarter numbers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $204 million for triple net-leased rental income reflects a sequential decline from the prior-quarter figure of $205 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for office building and other services revenues is $3.83 million, reflecting a 1.8% decline sequentially.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental income from office building is currently pegged at $193 million, indicating a rise from $192 million recorded in the prior-quarter.Amid these, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.01, over the past month. Also, this indicates a year-over-year decline of 2.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter revenues is pegged at $850.6 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 3.7%.Moreover, shares of Ventas have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While the company’s shares have lost 16%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 7.7%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Ventas will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time.

85,VTR,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes. While its funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipated to be up year over year, revenues might record a decline.Last quarter, the company reported FFO per share of 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%.Over the trailing four quarters, Macerich beat estimates in three occasions and posted in-line results in the other, generating an average positive beat of 2.17%.Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteHowever, the stock has lost 20% year to date, underperforming the 6.3% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsMacerich enjoys a portfolio of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. The presence of a number of well-capitalized retailers on its roster has enabled the company to maintain a stable source of rent for the past few quarters. Additionally, Macerich’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand, along with its tempered supply and aggressive capital-recycling program, augur well for growth.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this retail REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Subsequently, the company’s revenues from minimum rent will likely experience a marginal fall as compared to the prior quarter. The company realizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $151 million. This indicates a 1.3% decline on a year-over-year basis.  Percentage rents, which is realized when tenants' sales targets have been met, is also anticipated to witness a steep year-over-year decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 million reflects a 33.6% plunge as compared to the prior-year quarter.   Macerich’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 FFO remained unchanged at 98 cents over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

86,VTR,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the closing bell.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 7.14% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected robust same-store occupancy rate in the New York portfolio. However, this was offset by a decline in same-store occupancy and same-store earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the Washington D.C. portfolio.Moreover, Vornado has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and missed in the other three, witnessing an average negative surprise of 5.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteYear to date, shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have plunged 29.4%, the industry recorded growth of 2.3%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided either.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $528 million. This reflects a decline of 15.7% as compared with the previous quarter.Further, the company’s management and leasing fees are expected to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 million indicates a sharp drop of 36.8% from the prior quarter.  In addition, over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 FFO per share decreased 12.2%, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Nonetheless, Vornado’s wholly owned subsidiary, Building Maintenance Services (BMS), is expected to realize higher cleaning fees for its cleaning, engineering and security services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BMS cleaning fees of $21.4 million reflects a 0.7% increase from the prior quarter.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predicts a FFO beat for Vornado this time around.

The credit facility recast upsized Highwoods’ borrowing capacity by 125 million, extended maturity and lowered the borrowing spread by 10 basis points (bps).As of Sep 30, 2017, Highwoods had $4.9 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $49.5 million as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 OutlookHighwoods narrowed its 2017 FFO per share guidance range to $3.36-$3.38 from the previous range of $3.33-$3.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at $3.38.Our ViewpointImproving operating performance reflects brighter prospects for the company, going forward. Highwoods is making diligent efforts to expand its footprint in high-growth markets, and enhance the portfolio quality through prudent asset acquisitions and disposals. Furthermore, the company’s dispositions are anticipated to have miniscule impact on its revenues.Its focus on high-quality office assets in best business districts (BBDs) bode well. With the recovery in the economy and labor markets, Highwoods will likely experience healthy demand for office space. Nonetheless, Highwoods faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, as well as other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This restricts the company’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Highwoods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The figure also matched the year-ago quarter tally.Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.The bottom line for full-year 2017 came in at $4.16 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, the figure came in above the full-year 2016 FFO of $4.13 per share.The company posted revenues of $895.3 million in the fourth quarter, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $878.6 million. Further, it compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $875.7 million.For full-year 2017, revenues came in at $3.57 billion, up from the 2016 tally of $3.44 billion.

Further, in order to strengthen operational platform, the company recently transitioned the management of a portfolio of senior housing communities to Eclipse Senior Living.However, elevated supply of seniors housing assets in certain markets is likely to moderate rent and occupancy growth in the near-term. Further, the company is exposed to concentration risks since majority of its revenues are generated from a few tenants. Further, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. This is because it has substantial exposure to long-term leased assets. These restrict the company’s scope to drive top-line growth.Ventas, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ventas, Inc.

92,VTR,"Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 66 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Total operating revenues of around $193.7 million for the quarter also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $167.9 million.On a year-over-year basis, the company’s FFO per share remained unchanged, while total operating revenues inched up 1.5% year over year.During the reported quarter, Liberty Property accomplished lease deals for 5.9 million square feet of space. As of Sep 30, 2017, occupancy at the company’s in-service portfolio, spanning 100 million square feet, expanded 30 basis points (bps) sequentially to 95.9%.Amid these, shares of Liberty Property climbed 2% to $42.38 during regular trading session on Oct 24.Quarter in DetailLiberty Property’s industrial portfolio, spanning 93.4 million square feet, enjoyed occupancy of 96.3% at the end of the quarter, marking an expansion of 40 bps from the prior quarter. Industrial distribution rents escalated 14.8% on renewal and replacement leases signed during the quarter.  On the other hand, the office portfolio, comprising 6.7 million square feet of space, had occupancy of 91.0%, down 50 bps from the prior quarter. Office rents were up 12.6% on renewal and replacement leases.Same-store properties’ operating income increased 3.0% year over year on a cash basis and 2.6% on a straight-line basis. Additionally, same-store operating income for the industrial portfolio climbed 5.2% on a cash basis and 4.3% on a straight-line basis. However, same-store operating income for office portfolio descended 7.7% on a cash basis and 5.3% on a straight-line basis.Balance Sheet PositionLiberty Property exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $47.7 million, up from $43.6 million recorded at the end of the prior year.Notably, during the reported quarter, the company’s share repurchase authorization was renewed by its board of trustees to purchase up to $250 million of its outstanding common shares.

The company’s premium quality industrial properties, situated in key locations, are likely to help it leverage on the increasing demand amid an e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations. It is poised for growth as fundamentals of the industrial real estate market remain robust, resulting in solid rent growth, enhanced occupancy and development opportunities. Liberty Property plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties. Nevertheless, adverse near-term impact on earnings from dispositions and rise in interest rates remain concerns.Currently, Liberty Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

93,VTR,"Healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before the market opens. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) and revenues are anticipated to be up year over year.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 0.95%. Results reflected growth in same-store cash net operating income (NOI) across triple net-leased portfolio, senior housing operating portfolio and medical office building portfolio.Further, Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.99% over the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteHowever, Ventas’ shares have remained flat year to date, underperforming 4.8% growth registered by the industry.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Ventas has a high chance of beating Q3 estimates. This is because the company has the right combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Ventas is +0.13%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Ventas currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsVentas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from increasing healthcare spending and aging population. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of citizens with more than 85 years of age is estimated to reach 8.7 million by 2030.In addition, Ventas is focusing on achieving an optimum mix of healthcare real estate assets. The company has made sound efforts to expand its portfolio in the medical office life science real estate market. Such investments will likely help the company capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities in the third quarter. Also, Ventas is aggressively shedding its skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) portfolio. In the third quarter, the company completed the first phase of disposal of 36 SNFs. Since SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to changes in medical billing procedure, companies are reducing exposure to this asset class. Following this sale, Ventas will be able to bring down its net operating income (NOI) from SNFs to just 1% of its aggregate NOI. Hence, such moves are anticipated to support the company’s operating margins in the quarter under review.  Nonetheless, oversupply in some markets has burdened the performance of Ventas’s senior housing assets. Since this curtails the landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, we expect the prevalent oversupply situation to impact the company’s third-quarter numbers.However, there is lack of any positive catalyst to become overtly positive on the stock. Therefore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 remained unchanged over the past two months.  Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

(BXP  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter earnings on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.39% and a Zacks Rank of 3. Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

94,VTR,"Ventas Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is making every effort to ride on the growth curve through strategic dispositions and accretive investments.The company recently accomplished the first phase of the sale of its 36 SNFs, operated by Kindred Healthcare, Inc. , to an affiliate of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC. In the first phase, the company sold 22 SNFs, which helped it reap $488 million in proceeds, marking a 7% yield on current cash rent.The company anticipates to generate $700 million in proceeds from the sale of the total 36 SNFs, which indicates a 7%-cash yield on the current annual cash rent of $50 million and an 8% GAAP yield. The company is projected to gain more than $600 million from the sale of all the 36 SNFs.The move is in sync with Ventas’ strategy of de-emphasis of this particular healthcare real estate category. Notably, amid healthcare reforms, though seniors housing, medical-office buildings and hospitals have been able to reap solid top-line growth in recent years, skilled nursing facilities are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the shift in medical billing procedure.Notably, the company successfully spun-off majority of its SNF business in 2015. Following the anticipated sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs, Ventas will be able to bring down its net operating income (NOI) from SNFs to just 1% of its aggregate NOI.On the other hand, Ventas is making investments for its future prospects through selective development and redevelopment. The company has targeted on fortifying its position in the medical office and life science real estate market. In the second-quarter 2017 earnings release, it announced that it expects to invest by funding around $350 million in development and redevelopment projects for full-year 2017. This would include lucrative new ground-up medical office and life science developments.Specifically, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment, which has been driving attention and Ventas has already made decent amount of investments in this segment. Such investments offer the opportunity to capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, has also promoted the institutional life science and medical-market fundamentals. Further, long-lease terms and top-rated, institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for Ventas.Also, Ventas has a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to eye high-yielding acquisitions and high ROI (return on investments) capital projects. As of Jul 28, 2017, the company enjoyed solid liquidity with $2.6 billion of available borrowing capacity and $95 million of cash on hand.Additionally, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Ventas remains committed to that. In fact, the company’s annual cash dividend per share has increased at a CAGR of 8% since 2001. Given the company’s financial position, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.However, increase in supply of seniors housing assets in certain markets remain a concern for Ventas. This is because elevated supply usually curtails the landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level. Also, dilutive impact of asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term.Furthermore hike in the interest rate is a concern for Ventas, particularly considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets. In addition, rising rates increase the cost of financing acquisitions, investment and development-activity costs, and also lower the amount which third parties are ready to pay for the company’s assets at disposal.Nevertheless, the stock has gained 9.3% year to date, outperforming 4.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate space include PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report), InfraREIT Inc. (HIFR  -  Free Report) and UMH Properties, Inc., (UMH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.While PS Business Parks and InfraREIT have expected long-term growth rates of 5% and 8%, respectively, the expected long-term growth rate for UMH Properties is currently pegged at 10%.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.

95,VTR,"Ushering in good news for shareholders, Ventas’ (VTR  -  Free Report) board of directors announced a 2% sequential hike in fourth-quarter 2017 common stock dividend. The revised dividend now comes in at 79 cents per share versus the previous figure of 77.5 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Jan 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.16 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of 5%, considering Ventas closing price of $63.32 on Dec 11. For income tax purposes, the quarterly dividend will be included in the stockholders’ taxable income for 2018.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for real estate investment trusts (REIT) investors and this healthcare REIT had earlier announced a 6% hike in fourth-quarter 2016 dividend. Ventas continued to pay the raised dividends throughout 2017. Such investor friendly moves boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Also, the company has an impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, it has raised dividends every year for more than a decade. Ventas has achieved a total increase of nearly 9% in dividends since fourth-quarter 2013. This highlights the company’s encouraging future outlook as well as its continued efforts to grow shareholders’ wealth.Ventas’ financial health can be judged by its cash flow per share. The company churns cash flow per share of $4.35, significantly higher than the industry’s average of $2.27. Further, its current ratio indicates a decent liquidity position. A secure cash flow position will help the company sustain its dividend payout in the future.Additionally, optimal utilization of equity has resulted in a return on equity (ROE) of 6.34%, while the industry has delivered 5.78%.However, poor fundamentals of the company might lead to dividend cuts. The amount of debt assumed by a company influences the dividend growth and Ventas’ high level of debt raises concerns over the sustainability of the current dividend level. Ventas is a highly leveraged company with a debt/equity ratio of 1.06 as compared to the industry’s ratio of 0.84. Furthermore, its current cash flow growth of 12.9% is lower than the industry’s average of 15.9% and makes interest payments coverage difficult. This impedes the stock’s upside potential.Year to date, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have underperformed the industry. During the period, shares of Ventas have gained just 1.3%, while the industry has recorded growth of 6.1%.Better-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust space include Franklin Street Properties (FSP  -  Free Report), Columbia Property Trust (CXP  -  Free Report) and MedEquities Realty Trust (MRT  -  Free Report).

96,VTR,"Ventas Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) recently accomplished the first phase of the sale of its 36 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to an affiliate of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC. These SNFs, which are currently operated by Kindred Healthcare, Inc. , are being sold to expedite Kindred’s exit from the skilled nursing segment, as well as lower Ventas’ exposure to this asset category.In the first phase, the sale of the 22 SNFs helped Ventas reap $488 million in proceeds that marked a 7% yield on current cash rent. The company anticipates to generate $700 million in proceeds from the sale of the total 36 SNFs, which indicates a 7%-cash yield on the current annual cash rent of $50 million and an 8% GAAP yield. The company is projected to gain more than $600 million from the sale of all the 36 SNFs.However, Ventas had previously announced that an early disposition of the larger part of the portfolio, along with the expected payback of LIBOR-based debt, would lead to a one cent per share per-month reduction in funds from operations (“FFO”). Thus, since a major chunk of the total portfolio sale has already been accomplished, the company’s 2017 normalized FFO is likely to lower by one cent per share per month, beginning Sep 1, 2017.Nevertheless, the above discussed move is in sync with Ventas’ strategy of de-emphasizing this particular healthcare real estate category. The company successfully spun-off majority of its SNF business in 2015, and following the anticipated sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs, Ventas will be able to bring down its net operating income (NOI) from SNFs to just 1% of its aggregate NOI.Amid the healthcare reforms implementation, healthcare REITs have been distancing themselves from the skilled nursing facility business. This is because though senior housings, medical-office buildings and hospitals have been able to reap solid revenue growth in recent years, SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the gradual shift in medical billing procedure.In fact, tenants of the SNFs derive majority of revenues in the form of payments from Medicare and other government insurance programs. However, these tenants have been facing shorter stays and lower rates amid the shift in the billing practices, which stresses more on the value of care provided rather than the volume of services offered. So, healthcare REITs prefer to refrain from this asset category and focus on private-pay assets, because in such cases tenants’ revenue trend is likely to remain steadier.Also, Ventas is making decent investments in university-based life science real estates. Such investments offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities. Nonetheless, there is rising supply of senior housing assets and near term dilution of earnings from asset dispositions cannot be bypassed. Further, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In addition, year to date, shares of Ventas have climbed 8.4% and outperformed its industry’s gain of 5.0%.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate space include Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

97,VTR,"Healthcare REIT – Ventas Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) – is making investment for its future prospects through selective development and redevelopment. The company is focused on fortifying its position in the medical office and life science real estate market.In fact, in the second-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company announced that it expects to invest by funding around $350 million in development and redevelopment projects for full-year 2017. This would include lucrative new ground-up medical office and life science developments.Notably, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment, which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already made decent amount of investments in this segment. Such investments offer the opportunity to capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, have also promoted the institutional life science and medical-market fundamentals. Further, long-lease terms and top-rated, institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for Ventas.On the other hand, Ventas reaffirmed the expected sale of 36 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for $700 million. These SNFs are currently being operated by Kindred Healthcare Inc. . The move is in sync with Ventas’ strategy of “de-emphasis” of this particular healthcare real estate category.Notably, amid healthcare reforms, though seniors housing, medical-office buildings and hospitals have been able to reap solid top-line growth in recent years, skilled nursing facilities are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure. The company successfully spun-off majority of its SNF business in 2015 and following the anticipated sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs, Ventas will be able to bring down its skilled nursing rent to 1% of the total business.However, increase in supply of senior housing assets in certain markets remain a concern for Ventas. This is because elevated supply usually curtails the landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level. Also, dilutive impact of asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term.Moreover, hike in the interest rate is a concern for Ventas, particularly considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets. In addition, rising rates increase the cost of financing acquisitions, investment and development-activity costs, and also lower the amount which third parties are ready to pay for the company’s assets at disposal.Nevertheless, the stock has gained 6.5% year to date, outperforming 3.1% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksInvestors interested in the real estate space can also consider stocks like Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) and PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

98,VTR,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 8.1%. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high.Over the preceding four quarters, Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and met in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 4.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 71 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market is firing on all cylinders, backed by an improving economy and job-market gains, strengthening e-commerce market and high consumption levels. Demand for warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong, and continues to surpass supply levels.In fact, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 32 straight quarters to 7.2% for the U.S. industrial real estate market in the April-June quarter. Notably, this denotes the lowest level since 2000.Given Prologis’s capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. It also has solid balance-sheet strength. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is expected to have enjoyed high occupancy of its properties and healthy rent levels.Moreover, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity has been stellar in the year so far, with the company completing 16 such development projects in the first half. These projects included more than 6.2 million square feet of area and involved total expected investment (TEI) of around $475 million on a Prologis-share basis. Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) commenced 14 build-to-suit development starts during the same period, comprising more than 4.7 million square feet of space and involving a TEI of approximately $450 million on a Prologis-share basis.This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s land bank, as well as demand from its multi-site customers, many of whom are focused on e-commerce. These sites are positioned in urban markets that are suited for serving as the last warehouse before goods are delivered to consumers.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. Also, there is intense competition in the market. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $560 million, indicating 0.7% increase sequentially.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter being revised 1.4% upward to 71 cents over the past three months. However, the figure denotes a projected year-over-year decrease of around 15.5%.Year to date, Prologis has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have appreciated 1.8% in this period compared with its industry’s growth of 0.5%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +2.26%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

99,VTR,"Healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 9, before the market opens. The company’s revenues are anticipated to be up year over year while its funds from operations (FFO) are expected to remain stable.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT delivered in-line results. The results reflected improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.73% in the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteShares of Ventas have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While the company’s shares have lost 17.8%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 7%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Ventas will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.07%.Zacks Rank: Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong sell), which reduces the predictive power of ESP.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsVentas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from increasing healthcare spending and aging population. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of citizens with more than 85 years of age is estimated to reach 8.7 million by 2030.In addition, Ventas is focusing on achieving an optimum mix of healthcare real estate assets. The company has made sound efforts to expand its portfolio in the medical office life science real estate market. Such investments will likely help the company capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Also, Ventas is aggressively shedding its skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) portfolio. In the third quarter, the company finished the first phase of disposal of 36 SNFs. Companies are reducing exposure to this asset class because SNFs are becoming more vulnerable to top-line pressure due to changes in medical billing procedure. Following this sale, Ventas will be able to bring down its net operating income (NOI) from SNFs to just 1% of its aggregate NOI. Thus, such moves are anticipated to support the company’s operating margin in the quarter under review.  Nonetheless, oversupply in some markets has burdened the performance of Ventas’s senior housing assets. Since this curtails the landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, we expect the prevalent oversupply situation to impact the company’s fourth-quarter numbers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $213 million for triple net-leased rental income reflects a sequential rise from the prior-quarter figure of $212 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for office building and other services revenues came in at $3.25 million, reflecting a 1.6% rise sequentially.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental income from office building is currently pegged at $190 million, reflecting no change from the prior quarter figure.Prior to fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.14, over the past month. Also, this indicates no change year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $878.6 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 0.32%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $3.53 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 2.6%. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $4.15, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 0.48%. Management expects FFO per share in the range of $4.13-$4.16.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to come up with a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15.

100,VTR,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its quarterly common dividend, giving shareholders a reason to rejoice. Specifically, the company will now pay a dividend of 63 cents per share, up from 60 cents paid in the prior quarter. The increased dividend will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders of record as on Jan 29, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the 2018 annual dividend comes to $2.52 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of about 3.53%, considering Vornado’s closing price of $71.30 on Jan 17. Though this is lower than the industry average of 4.36%, the hike will likely increase investors’ confidence in the stock.Notably, Vornado has a concentration of high-quality assets, with a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District, as well as theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic assets in signature cities.This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, as well as a diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, is anticipated to drive steady cash flows and fuel its growth engine over the long term.Moreover, the company, focused on improving its core business, has been making opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures in addition to business spin-offs. In fact, well-planned sell-outs provide the company with dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions.The 2017 spin-off of its Washington, D.C properties made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. The focus on New York is a strategic fit given that the city is preferred by businesses, residents, tourists and investors. It enjoys solid long-term employment growth with a diversified employment base. In addition, the city attracts international tourists and enjoys steady tourism growth.Also, the previous spin-off of its shopping center business into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties (UE  -  Free Report) was an outcome of Vornado’s decision to separate two businesses, which have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies. Such efforts to streamline the company’s business are likely to drive Vornado’s long-term growth.Vornado boasts a strong liquidity position with decent leverage and well-manageable debt maturities. As of Sep 30, 2017, Vornado had nearly $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, in October 2017, the company announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities. The extended credit facility will improve the company’s liquidity position. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.The company is likely to benefit from improvement in the economy and the job market. However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Further, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 4.7%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.6% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Apart from Vornado some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months include Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report), Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report) and Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report).Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

102,VTR,"Ventas, Inc.

Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, the company posted revenues of $895.5 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $878.8 million. It compared favorably with the year-ago number of $848.4 million.For the second quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for total portfolio (1,114 assets) climbed 1.5% year over year. By segments, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 2.0%, seniors housing operating portfolio inched up 0.4%, and medical office building portfolio rose 2.2%.Ventas, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ventas, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailDuring the quarter, Ventas funded investments of around $110 million. This included $53 million of acquisitions with existing partners in its seniors housing portfolio, as well as $57 million of funding for its share of development, and redevelopment projects for projects presently in progress.For financing its investments, the company issued and sold 1.1 million shares of common stock, reaping net proceeds of $74 million under the “at the market” equity offering program. Further, it disposed properties and obtained final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds of $45 million.LiquidityPresently, the company enjoys solid liquidity with $2.6 billion of available borrowing capacity and $95 million of cash on hand.2017 OutlookVentas reaffirmed its outlook and expects 2017 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.12–$4.18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.17.The company anticipates same-store cash NOI growth of 1.5–2.5% in 2017.Additionally, Ventas expects skilled nursing facilities (SNF) sale to take place in phases, starting in the third quarter, and likely to conclude by the end of this year.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Ventas in the second quarter. We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Furthermore, the sale of the SNF would lower the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment. Such investments offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities. However, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

107,VTR,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $1.04 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure also came in a penny higher than the year-ago quarter tally. Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, the company posted revenues of $895.5 million which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $869.4 million. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago number of $867.1 million.For the third quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for total portfolio (1,045 assets) climbed 2.1% year over year. Segment wise, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 3.8%, seniors housing operating portfolio inched up 0.6% and medical office building portfolio rose 1.5%.Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, Ventas funded investments of around $80 million.

The mid-point of the guidance remained unchanged from the prior guidance as the Kindred skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) sale offsets improved property performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.17. The company anticipates same-store cash NOI growth of 2-2.5% in 2017.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the in-line performance of Ventas in the third quarter. We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment.  The company acquired a 262,000-square-foot class-A life science building, which is currently 82% occupied. Such investments will likely offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development.In addition to this, sale of the SNFs enabled the company to realize around $570 million in sale proceeds. Also, the transaction lowered the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.However, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

116,VTR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, office REIT Boston Properties (BXP  -  Free Report) announced a 6.7% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate to 80 cents per share from 75 cents paid earlier. It will pay the raised dividend for the fourth quarter on Jan 30, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Dec 29, 2017.Reflecting positive sentiments of investors, the shares inched up 1.2% during Monday’s regular trading session to $130.96.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.20 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $3.00 per share, leading to an annualized yield of 2.4%, considering Boston Properties' closing price on Dec 18.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Boston Properties remains committed toward boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company has registered a five-year annual dividend growth rate of 4.87%. Prior to this dividend hike, in December 2016, Boston Properties had announced a 15.4% hike in its quarterly dividend rate.Boston Properties also has solid fundamentals to back dividend hikes. The company concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets that usually fare better in an uncertain economy. Moreover, growth in demand for office space continues to be fueled by technology and life science businesses.The company has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17% over the last five years. Given the company’s improving core operations, we anticipate this trend to continue, in the near future. In addition, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.Also, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, we expect healthy growth in demand for office spaces. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows and therefore, corporate sectors seek expansion, renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce.Additionally, the company remains focused on maintaining strong balance sheet with conservative leverage position. It enjoys substantial liquidity of around $2.5 billion and solid access to debt markets. Also, reflecting optimal utilization of equity, the company’s ROE is 6.43%, higher than the industry average of 5.78%.However, there is growth in supply of office space in the market and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and also curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents. There is also a trend of increased concessions in some of the markets.Shares of Boston Properties have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 9.5%, while the industry has increased 1.3% during the same time period.

122,VTR,"We are in the heart of the ongoing reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there have been a deluge of Q2 earnings releases this week, and next we have Welltower Inc. , Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) releasing quarterly numbers on Jul 28.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, a number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery. Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc.  – the overall U.S. industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter, with the industrial availability rate contracting 10 basis points to 7.8%.In addition, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid a balanced demand-supply environment. Moreover, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data are not only helping tech companies, these are also driving demand for data center REITs. Additionally, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels.However, dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. Also, for healthcare REITs, rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have put a pressure on pricing in some markets.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others may disappoint this earnings season. However to predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for the three REITs set to release quarterly results on Friday:Toledo, OH-based, Welltower’s efforts to enhance its healthcare real estate portfolio quality through prudent asset allocation and disposal, along with its diversified portfolio, are anticipated to boost its performance in the quarter to be reported. Additionally, rising senior citizen population will likely prove conducive to growth.However, interest rate hike remains a concern for Welltower due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets. In addition, increased deliveries in certain markets are likely to adversely affect the company's pricing power and occupancy. Further, intense competition from national and local healthcare operators curtails the company’s power to significantly improve its top line and ink deals at attractive rates. (Read more: What's in the Cards for Welltower in Q2 Earnings?)Welltower has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. However, it currently has a Zacks Rank #4, which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.Over the trailing four quarters, Welltower posted in-line funds from operations (“FFO”) per share in one occasion and beat estimates in the other three, recording an average positive surprise of 0.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Welltower Inc. QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT Ventas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from its diversification efforts, increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Furthermore, its strong balance sheet positions it well for growth. Moreover, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment that has grabbed attention and Ventas has, by now, already committed nearly $2 billion to this segment.However, hike in interest rate is a concern for Ventas, as the company has considerable exposure to long-term leased assets. Additionally, rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have a pressure on pricing in some of the company’s markets. (Read more: Ventas to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Ventas has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s zero ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.99% with respect to FFO per share over the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions.

Additionally, a solid product portfolio and increasing market share are growth catalysts.However, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. In addition, the storage and information management services industry remains a highly fragmented industry with intensifying competition.

124,VTR,"Healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the market opens.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 1.96%. Results reflect decent growth in same-store cash net operating income (NOI). Also, the company made quality investments of over $1 billion in the quarter.Further, Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.99% over the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteLooking at the price performance, Ventas’ shares have rallied 9.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.2%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVentas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from its diversification efforts, increasing healthcare spending and aging population. In addition, its strong balance sheet positions it well for growth.Moreover, Ventas is focusing on quality acquisitions to fortify its position in the healthcare REIT industry. Particularly, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment that has grabbed attention and Ventas has, by now, already committed nearly $2 billion to this segment. Such investments offer the opportunity to capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Hike in interest rate is a concern for Ventas, as the company has considerable exposure to long-term leased assets. Rise in rate increases the cost of debt, which, in turn, adversely affects the profitability of the company. Moreover, rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have a pressure on pricing in some of the company’s markets.Amid these, there was lack of any positive catalyst to become overtly positive on the stock and therefore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 remained unchanged over the past 60 days.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ventas will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.04 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05, is -0.95%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ventas currently has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report), slated to release second-quarter results on Jul 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #2.
