0,ABMD,"Is a break below the 10-week moving average a key sell rule? Yes. But there are times when you shouldn't sell.Using good sell signals properly to turn paper gains into concrete profits is a cornerstone of IBD-style investing. But you also don't want to sell prematurely when a stock's terrific run-up is simply taking a pause.If a stock is truly poised to etch its ultimate peak or go into a full-blown correction, it will certainly fall below the 10-week moving average. But the stock should undercut the 10-week line severely. And IBD's founder Bill O'Neil has said he wants to see weekly volume pop at least 40% higher vs. the 10-week moving average of volume before taking action.So, what if volume in the down week was dull? If you have a big enough profit cushion, hold. Give it some rope. Great stocks rebound quickly. Or they may be building a new base. If the stock finishes in the upper half of the weekly price range, you can infer that big institutions are swooping in to grab shares at what they deem to be reasonable prices. They are quietly expressing confidence in the company's long-term course.Here's an outstanding example. See the weekly chart of Abiomed (ABMD). The heart pump innovator broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 in April 2017 and rallied 58% in 31 weeks.During that nifty run, how many times did the stock finish the trading week beneath the 10-week moving average? Zero.It finally happened during the week ended Dec. 15. Abiomed closed at 188.71, losing 1.4% that week. The 10-week moving average, which graphs the average weekly closing price over the past 10 weeks, stood at 188.84. But volume was whisper-like, 25% below average. The mild price-and-volume action signaled to holders that one could sit tight.The Danvers, Mass., firm soon completed a five-week flat base. Shares broke out past a 200.38 buy point on Jan. 5. Volume after the new year holiday was light. But trading picked up. On Jan. 16, Abiomed climbed past 218; volume surged 88% above the 50-day average.Back in June 2017, Grubhub (GRUB) may have disappointed some investors when it flipped 8.6% lower during the week ended June 30. A week prior, shares bolted 10% higher. A big drop like that after a big gain like that sure leaves a sour taste in the mouth, no?But let's look at the volume.In that week, Grubhub traded 14.4 million shares, 15% higher than its 10-week average. (On IBD and MarketSmith weekly charts, the volume bars also feature a line that shows the 10-week moving average.) That's active, but it falls short of the 40% minimum jump that would normally spur a sell decision.The Chicago-based mobile food ordering giant also held a mild gain above a 42.35 buy point in an elongated double-bottom base. Right move? No move. Grubhub spent the next week mildly beneath the 10-week line, then made savory gains over the next five weeks.Another pullback beneath the 10-week line during the week ended Sept. 22 proved mild. Volume rose just 19% above average, and Grubhub nearly finished in the upper half of the week's price range. Grubhub broke out of a cup without handle at 57.71 in October and has climbed more than 90%.IBD Leaderboard name Five Below (FIVE) sank 6% during the week ended Feb. 2 as the major indexes began their first intermediate correction in 2018. But volume was light, 13% below average.The 33% swan dive by Kemet (KEM) during the week ended Nov. 3 marked a good time to sell, especially if your gains were limited. Volume throttled 86% higher than usual.Trade the IBD 50 efficiently via the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

1,ABMD,"Through Thursday's close, the medical sector ranked No. 5 among the 33 broad sectors that IBD tracks for middle and long-term performance. The sector has rallied 16% since Jan. 1. So, IBD readers will likely not be surprised to see as many as four of the 16 individual stocks that hit the Sector Leaders screen come from this key section of the economy.With unemployment near record lows and consumer spending revving up, medical care firms stand to benefit. Americans are more willing to spend on improving their health. In IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups (please see Page B7 in IBD Weekly), the medical products group ranks No. 1 in six-month progress, up from 11th six weeks ago. The group has risen 24% since Jan. 1. One of the group's big winners, Abiomed (ABMD), has vaulted 118%.When was the right time to pick up shares in the innovator of heart pumps? A true market leader will storm out of bases throughout its run. Bases are nothing more than periods of time when a stock peaks, corrects in price, bottoms out, rises back near the old highs, and breaks out to new highs.For Abiomed, a five-week flat base with a 200.38 correct buy point produced a breakout on Jan. 5. In April it broke out of another flat base at 304.38.If a good stock has broken out, look for rebounds off the 10-week moving average. The first two instances offer a secondary opportunity to establish a position or add a small amount of shares to an existing one. Abiomed bounced off its 10-week line near 290 during the week ended April 27. Volume increased above the 10-week average. Then the next week, turnover really shot up as the large-cap medical device firm rallied 16% and hit new highs.Align Technology (ALGN), HealthEquity (HQY) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) have also gone on steep run-ups after their breakouts.Notice on a weekly chart how Align, developer of the Invisalign orthodontic braces, has staged a seven-week winning streak. Along the way, the stock cleared a 280.33 entry within a base that showed the essential elements of a cup with handle. Align is very close to rising 25% past that prime buy point.Taking most of your profits by selling winners at 20%-25% is smart portfolio management. You can hold shares longer in high-conviction plays. But locking in gains on the way up allows you to raise cash for future buys.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on leading stocks, charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Tesla Faces This Critical Test NowWhy This Rule Helps You Become A Savvy Portfolio Manager In StocksUsing The 10-Week Moving Average Like A Stock ProThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow To Find The Correct Entry In Hot Growth Stocks

2,ABMD,"Individual investors can get a sense of a stock's true value by asking two questions.Is institutional money going into or out of the stock? Are the top funds buyers, holders or sellers?In the first quarter, four stocks in the Big Cap 20 were leaders in fund support.Funds stepped up their overall stake in Twitter (TWTR) by 19.8% in Q1 compared with the previous quarter. No other stock in the recent Big Cap 20 did better.The number of funds with money on the online platform operator increased by 17.6%, another good sign.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat about elite funds? Among funds with IBD A+ ratings, nine opened new positions in Twitter, while 12 others added to existing positions. Three A+ funds stood pat. Eight A+ funds did some selling.So, we might say the bulls outscored the bears, 21 to 8.Funds increased their exposure in apparel retailer Lululemon Athletica (LULU) by 4.4% in Q1.The number of funds grew 3%.Within the A+ fund ranks, one fund opened a new position while six added shares to existing positions. Ten A+ funds held their positions, but three cut their exposure.The overall score: 7-3, advantage bulls.Cardiac device maker Abiomed (ABMD) attracted nearly 4% in additional share support in Q1. The number of funds rose 13%.Among A+ rated funds, six opened new positions, five added shares to existing positions and eight stayed at the same level of exposure. But 10 A+ funds did some selling.The overcall score: 11-10, or roughly even.Online social network operator Facebook (FB) was the busiest of the four, at least among A+ rated funds.Funds increased their Facebook stake 3.6% in Q1.

When a fund establishes a new position, chances are that it will continue to add to that position and be less likely to sell it in the near future.""Reports on such activities are available about six weeks after the end of a fund's three- or six-month period.""RELATED:Economic Optimism Rises In U.S.Poll: Trump Loses Ground With Men, Gains With WomenMcDonald's To Ax Some Management Jobs

3,ABMD,"Two top stocks with very different characteristics and companies are preparing to report results early Thursday. Abiomed (ABMD) reports its fiscal fourth quarter results. Floor & Decor (FND) turns in first-quarter numbers.One trait the two top stocks do share: both are listed on IBD's Stock Spotlight stock screen. Another important factor: analysts expect both to generate EPS growth greater than 60%, while sales growth is forecast to be above 30%.For Abiomed, its 60% EPS growth target would mark a sharp downshift after two quarters of triple-digit earnings gains. Its track record with topping estimates is uneven. In its fiscal first and second quarters, it beat analyst targets by 95% and 42%, respectively. In the third quarter, earnings were shy of expectations by 43%.The Danvers, Mass.-based company has a market capitalization of $13.6 billion, while generating revenue of $445 million in fiscal 2017. The consensus estimate is for a 31% revenue increase this year to $584 million, with earnings rising 85%.Abiomed produces small pumps that are inserted using a catheter through an artery in the leg and into the heart. Sold under the Impella name, they supplement and increase the pumping power of the heart. It markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In October, Abiomed announced its first Impella recipient in Japan. But the company reported that sales outside the U.S. accounted for less than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn terms of stock action, shares Tuesday were up 63% since the start of the year. In addition, the stock was in a buy range above a 304.38 buy point in a flat base. The base is very late stage. That means the current breakout comes with a high risk of failure. The good news: The stock only needs to pullback about 11% in order to undercut the current base pattern and reset its base count.Among top stocks, Floor & Decor is considered a smaller midcap, with a market capitalization of $5.3 billion. It generated revenue of $1.39 billion in 2017. The company distributes wood and tile flooring through a network of 83 warehouse-type locations scattered over 21 states. Competitor Lumber Liquidator's (LL) stores are relatively small, and tucked into mini-mall-type locations. By contrast, Floor & Decor stores average around 73,000 square feet. Home Depot (HD) stores, for comparison's sake, average about 105,000 square feet.Analyst consensus places the Smyrna, Ga., company's first quarter EPS growth at 64%, with a 30% advance in revenue. The first quarter is seasonally a strong period for the company, and the consensus estimate is below last year's first-quarter gain of 75%.The revenue forecast is just below Floor & Decor's average sales gain of 30% over the past three quarters. The company has topped analyst expectations over the past four quarters by margins of anywhere from 5% to 30%. For the year, analysts see EPS rising 39% on a 25% sales gain.Floor & Decor is a young stock, public only since April 2017. Unlike Abiomed's tight-trading shares, the IPO swings wide and loose on a regular basis. It was up only 11% for the year Tuesday, but trading 163% above its year-ago IPO price.Shares are currently extended, 7% above a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup base. It's four weeks into a 14% deep consolidation.RELATED:Permian Basin Oil Stocks: These 2 Face High Expectations This WeekThe Market Trend: Keep Tabs On Market Indicators and StatusMajor Stock Indexes Reverse Lower, Techs Hit As Attention Shifts To FedTesla, Mastercard, Square, Fed Lead Investing Action Plan Nvidia, Apple: How To Avoid Getting Chopped Up In A Choppy Market Stocks Near Lows In Afternoon Trade; This Top Chip Stock Bucks Dow's Sell-Off

4,ABMD,"How hot is $12.5 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) right now? Very! Driven by leading growth stocks like Abiomed (ABMD), Alibaba (BABA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), the MainStay fund is up 13.37% this year going into Thursday.That tops 95% of rival large-cap funds focused on growth stocks that are tracked by Morningstar. And it dwarfs the S&P 500's 2.7%.Abiomed, which was added to the S&P 500 on Thursday, has grown earnings per share at a triple-digit pace in the past three quarters. The maker of cardiac pumping devices is up 103% so far this year.As of Thursday, Alibaba was up 15% this year. Amazon had climbed 39%. Netflix had notched an 83% gain.As the fund explains to investors considering buying shares, the managers look ""to diversify holdings across three distinct, yet complementary, types of earnings growth to participate in different market cycles.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition, the fund sticks to subadvisor Winslow Capital's ""no preferred habitat"" approach. That means broad diversification with an eye to managing risk by not being overexposed to any one area of the market.MainStay fund managers Justin Kelly and Patrick Burton cope with different market environments by adjusting their allocations among three types, or buckets, of growth stocks.One bucket holds stocks that Kelly and Burton think will be able to sustain earnings growth for long periods. The second bucket holds dynamic growth stocks — stocks in newer industries with rapid growth. The third bucket holds cyclical growth stocks. Operating in more economically sensitive sectors, they may be more volatile.Abiomed is in the dynamic growth bucket. The stock replaced leisure-lodging stock Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) in the S&P 500 index. Many funds, especially index funds, will add Abiomed to their portfolios just because it is now part of the popular benchmark.""Abiomed has had the biggest innovation in cardiac surgery in years by having a balloon pump to help patients extend the life of their hearts during cardiac arrest,"" lead manager Kelly said. ""It works substantially better than all preceding technologies.""The company's market opportunity is about 10 times what its market is today, Kelly says, as its technology grabs market share over the next five to 10 years.Alibaba is another dynamic growth holding. It is the leading e-commerce platform in China, and its share is growing.""Alibaba is pursuing four markets that are extremely large,"" Burton said. ""The first is its traditional e-commerce business in China. The second is digital advertising. As the company adds e-commerce customers, it boosts its advertising business. The third is its cloud computing business. As it builds its online infrastructure, it can sell that service to other companies. And the fourth is its emerging retail business. It is taking its e-commerce and logistics expertise and applying them to grocery and food delivery, where there is a massive total available market opportunity.""Alibaba is a member of the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks. So are Netflix and Abiomed.Amazon, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, is in the fund's consistent growers bucket. The stock barely paused when it recently took heat amid news that one of the company's Echo smart-speaker devices recorded a couple's private conversation in their home and sent it to someone on their contact list without their knowledge.""Amazon is our largest holding,"" Kelly said. ""We're still excited about their two main businesses. The first is retail, which still has a tremendous runway to go. They have 5% of total retail transactions in the U.S., but they get 20% of the total growth. That indicates that they will get to 20% of the total market, so the opportunity is four times what it is today.""Amazon Web Services is the second business that Kelly and Burton like. ""We think it is in the early stages of moving corporate work flows from on-premises software to the cloud. Their technology for doing this is in the front of the industry, so they should remain the leader, with Microsoft (MSFT) number two, and that's why Microsoft is our second largest holding.""Among other holdings, ASML (ASML) is in the fund's cyclical growth bucket. The Dutch-based company is a manufacturer of lithography systems used to manufacture integrated circuits. Its shares are up 15% this year.""ASML has two key drivers,"" Burton said. ""First is global demand for semiconductor chips, which is expanding at two-plus times the growth rate of global GDP. It's driven by growth in cloud computing and mobile communications.""Burton likes ASML's EUV technology. ""It stands for extreme ultraviolet, and it helps makers of chips. ASML is the only company in the world with this technology.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Retirement Costs — With Little Sacrifice

Adobe, Macy's, Copart, CSX, Abiomed and several others are testing their 10-week moving averages. See if fund managers step in to protect and add to their positions at that bench mark line.

The stock's A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio further indicate demand for shares.TJX, which operates over 4,000 T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Marshalls and Sierra Trading Post stores, has been trading within a very narrow price range. A break above the peak in that formation in heavy volume could offer an add-on buying opportunity.Specialty paint manufacturer RPM International (RPM) bolted past a 56.79 entry on June 28. The move came as the company announced a new deal with Elliott Management to boost efficiencies and shareholder value. RPM has managed to hold the bulk of those gains.Electronic components maker Kemet (KEM) recently jumped past a 25.79 entry in a deep and later-stage cup with handle. The IBD 50 stock went on a massive run from a low of 1.34 in February 2016 to a high of 27.35 in October 2017. After a sharp decline following that move, Kemet has rebounded and now sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.0 up/down volume ratio. Note how the 10-week line is now back above the longer-term 40-week moving average — a sign of renewed technical strength. Kemet is now out of buy range.Oil and gas stock Rowan (RDC) topped the list of stocks being sold with 14 net sellers (19 funds selling minus five buying). Vishay Intertechnology (VSH), which makes transistors, diodes and capacitors, was the only other stock in double-digits, with 10 net sellers (16 selling minus six buying).Despite that selling, Vishay has shown resilience.

6,ABMD,"There's an elite quality to IBD's Sector Leaders screen, which uses a strict selection criteria that results in just a handful of stocks making the list.That selective and growth-oriented method also has resulted in superior gains. Year to date, the Sector Leaders stocks are up more than 18% as a group, from the moment they enter the screen to when they are removed.That's way better than the market-leading Nasdaq composite, which is up 13.3% through Thursday's close, and the Russell 2000's 10% increase for 2018. Sector Leaders also tops just about all other IBD screens, beating the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20.Only the Nasdaq side of Stock Spotlight screen does any better, up 22% through Wednesday's close. NYSE Spotlight stocks are up a collective 6.2%.While the stocks in Sector Leaders change often, a few have excelled.Abiomed (ABMD) is the single biggest contribution to Sector Leader's success. The stock has about doubled this year, having started its impressive run with a breakout the first week of this year past a 200.38 buy point. The stock is now testing support in a pullback to the 10-week moving average.Abiomed makes the Impella heart pump. Goldman Sachs says Impella faces little competition for at least two to three years. With expanded use in medical applications and new territories, Abiomed's total market could grow to $30 billion, Goldman analysts have said.Salesforce.com (CRM) has risen about 35% after a breakout past 109.29 in early January. The company is a leader in customer relationship software, with an estimated 20% of the global market in 2017.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is one of the biggest names in cybersecurity, and one of the most profitable. It shares with Qualys (QLYS) the highest EPS Rating of 30 companies in the security software industry group. Shares broke out Jan. 18 at 156.95 and are up nearly 40% from there, at record highs.Five Below (FIVE) was having a mediocre year, until early June. Most of the stock's 2018 gains happened the week ended June 8, when shares soared 42%. At that time, the fast-growing chain of popular and trendy items that sell of $5 or less beat earnings expectations and gave a bullish outlook.The company announced a new distribution center near Atlanta that will aid its expansion in the Southeast.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) has had an up-and-down year, but it's up about 37% year to date. The subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG) saw its best move after a breakout April 5 from a 26.29 proper buy point. Viper is not on the current Sector Leaders list.In the long term, Sector Leader stocks as a whole have outperformed as well. The screen is up 34% in the past 12 months vs. 13.5% for the S&P 500.

7,ABMD,"Programmatic advertising innovator Trade Desk (TTD) scored a second straight big weekly gain, turning the character of its price action in a bullishly big way. On Friday, shares got as high as 85.45, posting a weekly advance of more than 13%.It was a terrific gain, but even that pales in comparison with the 53% catapult in the prior week.The strong move clearly makes the platform for digital ad purchasing extended from any IBD-style buy point. Before the breakout, Trade Desk seemed to be struggling in building the right side of an extra-deep cup base. From a peak of 67.30 to a low of 40.70, the 39.5% correction was deeper than the typical range for outstanding cup bases.So, why did the stock make such a eye-popping rally?As William O'Neil, IBD's founder, would often say, as much as 70% of a great growth company's value derives from its fundamental strength. The Ventura, Calif., firm has plenty of that. Earnings have vaulted 22%, 100%, 148%, 46%, 64% and 89% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Q1 earnings of 34 cents per share walloped the Wall Street consensus view by 240%.Revenue ramped up 61% to $85.7 million, a new record for the first quarter. The CAN SLIM paradigm calls on investors to search for companies that can grow earnings and sales 25% or more in the latest quarter.Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green noted in a news release that he's seeing a ""steady stream"" of new brands and advertising agencies joining the firm's platform, and the company has ""developed closer relationships with the biggest brands in the world.""When's the next potential entry? At this point, watch for tight trading weeks, future tests of institutional support at the 10-week moving average, and the production of new bases.Elsewhere, IBD 50 members Abiomed (ABMD), China Lodging (HTHT) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) scaled to new highs Friday. China Lodging is extended 8% past a 161 buy point in a 16-week double-bottom base. Ultimate is trying to distance itself past a 258.03 entry in a flat base.

9,ABMD,"In every issue of IBD Weekly, mini weekly charts for each stock of the IBD 50 stocks offer a concise snippet of guidance. The goal: answer many key questions.Is the stock in buy range? Or too far extended? Should you snatch some gains now? Or is the stock selling off so badly that a full exit is the right move?Is there another place to get even more detailed commentary and insight on what the top leaders are doing right now? Yes. Leaderboard, which launched a brand-new interface and new features on Thursday, can help.IBD's market writers create annotations on daily and weekly charts of the top 10 stocks ranked within the IBD 50. When one of these stocks hits an ideal time to buy, a blue annotation gets added. For sell signals, watch for annotations in red.These features arm both the beginning investor and the seasoned veteran with even more expertise on market timing. These annotations are placed in real time and are based on the rules IBD has developed through decades of research on what actually works in the stock market.Leaderboard users see regular updates on current action and a ""Leaderboard analysis"" for these top 10 stocks. The analysis also helps optimize the management of stock positions to reduce risk when the rally becomes long in the tooth. When market choppiness and corrections intensify, a user will get suggestions on when to cut the position by half. When the market uptrend resumes in bullish fashion or if the stock improves, the analyses note the precise moment in which to turn a half-size position back into a full one.Netflix (NFLX) ranked No. 10 within the IBD 50 at Thursday's close. The online video streaming giant joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, just as it rushed past an early entry point at 120. By February, the stock rose to 145. Leaderboard put a red annotation on the weekly chart, suggesting to take profits as the breakout gain hit the 20% threshold.Those with tons of conviction could, of course, decide to hold longer. Netflix has formed numerous bases since then, but the uptrend has stayed intact. More recently, on April 5, Netflix re-entered the Leaderboard as a half-size position. This made sense, given that market swings have been much more intense vs. 2017. On April 17, Netflix's Leaderboard chart showed a switch to full position following strong Q1 results. But the stock got cut back to half position just five trading sessions later as the stock began to gyrate.The most recent annotation to return to a full position? On April 26, as Netflix held firmly above the 50-day moving average. Institutions were shoring up the stock.Abiomed (ABMD) ranked No. 2 on Thursday. The Leaderboard analysis pointed out that buying back shares at 304.38 was justified, even though the stock had just flipped beneath that proper buy point. Abiomed triggered the golden rule of investing (cut your losses short). Yet it sometimes pays to buy back a good stock a second or third time. You need courage. But if the fundamentals are superior, and the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, you don't want to miss the potential big move.The chart noted how Abiomed has been showing nice buying support near the 10-week moving average. That's a hallmark of great stocks as they make their big price runs.E-Trade Financial (ETFC), also in the top 10, shows a third-stage base count on the annotations in its weekly chart. The higher the base count, the more risk that a breakout will fail. But the online broker continues to show positive action in the RS line and its tendency to hug its 10-week line.Trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

10,ABMD,"American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) got it right with Wabtec (WAB) — also known as Westinghouse Air Brake.The $11.4 billion portfolio is underweight in industrials, but its managers nonetheless made room for the locomotive equipment maker, starting in 2010. ""Wabtec fits our quality, durable-growth philosophy based on the management team, their track record and a business with a strong operating margin averaging 17% over the last five years,"" client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis told IBD. ""Further, the company has sustainable growth opportunities in aftermarket sales, which are high margin, and also due to strong demand for active safety and improved emission products that they produce.""On news of its agreement to merge with the diesel locomotive business of Dow Jones industrials veteran General Electric (GE) in an $11 billion deal, Wabtec was full steam ahead on Monday, chugging forward nearly 4%. Shares retreated 1% on Tuesday. It lost about another 1% on Wednesday and was up Thursday morning. That left the stock ahead about 19% for this year. Wabtec shareholders will own 49.9% of the combined company. Lewis said, ""We believe the structure of the merger makes sense and view favorably that Wabtec management remains in control and is leading the merged company.""The fund's managers hope to hit similar jackpots with other holdings in leading stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Abiomed (ABMD). Those stocks have gained 73%, 35% and 106% respectively this year.Overall, the fund aims to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and getting better, but where growth is not fully reflected in their share prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUltra Fund's success with that strategy is reflected in its 24.85% gain over the 12 months going into Wednesday. That outperformed 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Ultra is a bottom-up portfolio. It invests stock by stock. Buys and sells are not dictated by sectors or macro factors. Still, there are some broad themes that make some industries more likely ponds for the managers to reel in catches.One is the technology sector, where the managers see lots of growth stock stories. Information technology ended Q1 as the portfolio's largest overweight. ""We continue to find strong growth opportunities through bottom-up fundamental analysis,"" managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke told shareholders in their latest commentary. In the first quarter, the fund added to its stakes in Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).Netflix has IBD's highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. Netflix offers TV shows and movies to subscription customers via the internet.Netflix is the most-watched streaming service, viewed by 46% of respondents, up from 42% a year ago, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS). Original programming is the main draw for Netflix.Amazon Prime Video is the third most-watched streaming service. It now captures 30% of viewers polled by Morgan Stanley. That was up from 27% a year ago.Amazon's earnings per share were flat then grew 40% and 121% the most recent quarters. Trading around 1,584, shares are just above a 1,568.62 buy point.PayPal, a tech name to which the fund added, in November agreed to sell its U.S. consumer credit business to Synchrony Financial (SYF) for $5.8 billion. Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Trading around 390, shares are extended from a 304.38 buy point in a late-stage base.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group. In turn, that group ranks a very strong No. 3 out of 197 groups. Leaders in strong industries get that way by showing superior earnings growth and sales. Abiomed got to the top of its industry group in part by growing earnings per share in four straight years and by posting a 44% three-year EPS growth rate.In addition to Abiomed, holdings include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Maximize Your Social Security Benefits: How To ApplyYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

11,ABMD,"Riding the broad stock market's modest rally in April, many of the best mutual funds clawed their way up last month. Market volatility has increased amid growing signs that interest rates will keep rising. Stocks, bonds and the mutual funds that invest in them are in for more of the same in the months ahead, according to experts at Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP).That market scenario points to opportunities in growth stocks, says Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""The market will recognize growth in earnings as a key driver,"" he said. ""Companies that are using extra cash from tax reform and generating capital expenditures, investing in innovative products and ideas, those companies will benefit. Companies that are more yield sensitive will have a harder time being attractive.""But Ameriprise chief market strategist David Joy warns not to count on leadership from the growth stocks that have been highfliers for the past year or more. Many familiar growth names have grown pricey, he cautions.The S&P 500's 0.38% April advance reclaimed some of its 2.54% setback in March. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds fought through weakness late in the month to scratch out a 0.27% gain for April after falling 0.93% in March.Small-cap value funds' 0.81% April gain led the meager rally by U.S. diversified stock funds.One key hurdle for stock funds in April was the rise in yield on the 10-year Treasury. Late in April, the yield briefly topped 3%. ""That offered investors increasingly decent income with lower risk (than stocks), so it drew investor money away from equities,"" Aguilar said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFear of a trade war also contributed to stocks' downward volatility. ""But that fear was greater in March,"" Aguilar said.In addition, many investors were concerned that the U.S. economy isn't growing fast enough. First-quarter GDP growth was 2.3%, slowest in a year. Yet that beat the widely forecast expectation of 2%.""Corporate earnings, stock valuations, overall economic growth — all ended up being positive,"" Aguilar said. ""And we're still just in the early stages of seeing benefits from fiscal stimulus. But all of those positives were clouded by high yields in fixed income.""World equity funds' slim 0.12% advance lagged the modest gain by U.S. diversified stock funds. Yet that was an improvement on their 0.85% loss in March. India region funds' 3.06% April gain led foreign stock fund categories.Natural resources funds paced sectors, gaining 8.58% last month, fueled by the uptrend in oil prices.Taxable bonds funds, many of them filled with older bonds, were hurt by climbing rates on average. Treasury funds fell 1.37%. High-yield funds were among the few categories to gain ground, rising 0.44%.Tax-exempt bond funds also retreated.Going forward, Aguilar likes companies that are investing in innovative products and ideas. ""Consumer discretionary, technology and health care are sectors where you find many companies like that,"" he said.Take a look at $10.4 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Seven of the fund's top 10 stocks as of Dec. 31 were either tech or health care names.Among Odyssey's tech names: memory-chip maker Micron Technology ()

17,ABMD,"Paycom Software (PAYC) gets plastered by sellers after posting Q1 results late Tuesday, down as much as 10%. Former IBD 50 name Zoetis (ZTS) is slammed more than 7% after its Thursday report.And just a few weeks earlier, Micron Technology (MU) is sent packing to the showers, batted down nearly 20% in the span of 10 trading sessions. Why? March 22. Good fiscal Q2 numbers.Sense a pattern here?The months of January, April, July and October never fail to remind investors how stocks can soar or plunge on quarterly results. This peculiar pattern, in a way, presents a challenge to all U.S. stock investors. Have you been trading stocks the IBD way for a few months or for a few decades? All it takes is just a few quarterly results among high-powered growth stocks to know the risks of holding a big position right before the news.Earnings results are Wall Street's version of the double-edged sword.You're a smart trader. Your goal: maximize the profits in big winners and minimize losses in weaker plays. So, consider these four suggestions that can help you navigate choppy waters. They likely carry more weight now as IBD's current outlook stands at ""uptrend under pressure.""Tip 1: Study the stock's long-term character. Let's revisit Paycom. The HR management software firm and Leaderboard name cleared a base Feb. 9, 2017, a day after posting exceptional results (EPS up 80% in Q4 2016, revenue up 35%). But a pair of key follow-on buy points came in between quarterly results. The first and second pullbacks to the 10-week moving average came during the weeks ended March 31 and June 16 the same year.However, Abiomed (ABMD) has acted differently. The heart-pump firm broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 during the week ended April 28, 2017, a week before it shared fiscal Q4 results.A more recent breakout past a five-week flat base at 200.48 took place on Jan. 5 this year, three weeks before the next quarterly report.Tip 2: Count, count, count. That is, check the number of bases that stocks in your portfolio have created. Has your stock built a third, fourth or fifth base? Chances of a severe post-earnings slide go up. (Readers can use the pattern recognition service on MarketSmith to save time in counting bases.)A stock must rise at least 20% from a correct entry point in a primary base or the top of a base on base before it can form the next-stage base.If your stock is in an earnings turnaround and you scooped shares on an early-stage breakout, you likely may see more strong quarterly results ahead that can keep the rally humming. Apple (AAPL) is not an IBD 50 play, but it still serves as perhaps one of the finest examples in 2017. Through the March quarter, the iPhone giant has now strung together five straight quarters of double-digit profit growth. That's not easy for a firm that logged $229 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.Tip 3: Pocket your gains on the way up. Have you heard of the expression, ""betting with house money""? It means you've sold part of your position in a winning stock and no one can take those profits away. But you keep some shares to participate in further upside. A great earnings report can carry a market leader further. But it's smart portfolio strategy to at least snatch partial gains when your stock rises 20% to 25% past the most recent breakout point. Want to aim for 30%, 40% profits? Sure. But never forget that most pigs get slaughtered.Tip 4: Check the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Has this proprietary measure, found in Stock Checkup and in IBD's stock research tables, weakened in recent weeks? If so, perhaps institutions have been dumping more shares than usual. Why? They may lack confidence about the upcoming three-month results or next quarter's outlook. This rating studies price-and-volume interaction over the past 13 weeks.Trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Funds.

20,ABMD,"With nearly four months' worth of stock market action in 2018 now in the rear view mirror, the major indexes' story has been this: We let nice gains slip away.The lesson for investors? Don't let your gains do the same.The S&P 500, a 19% gainer in 2017, is down only a touch since Jan. 1. But the large-cap benchmark lost a more than 7% advance during the first 4-1/2 weeks of trading this year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund is also down mildly this year. The road has been bumpy for months. Just days ago, the ETF stabbed below its 200-day moving average for the third time since Feb. 9.So far, the ETF has managed to rebound after the two prior tests of the long-term support level. But many stocks in the IBD 50 and outside this list have failed to reach new highs.Earnings and sales have shown robust increases, as seen in first-quarter results hitting equity traders' computer screens these past few weeks. But the market always looks ahead, and it always has something to consider and evaluate. Lately, the sharp rise in yield for the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond appears to be a front-burner issue.A new bull market in crude oil prices and the possibility of accelerating inflation also deserve prominent space in the current market picture.As an IBD-style investor, you'll want to always adjust your holding and selling strategy when the overall market shifts. Right now, with the current outlook at ""uptrend under pressure,"" taking profits more quickly is a smart strategy. If your stock is up, say, 15% from a proper buy point but is showing signs of fatigue, you can at least sell half the shares and keep watching.The longer you've played the game of buying on breakouts in good markets and sitting patiently for the stock to hit the 20% to 25% profit goal, the more likely you've seen a stock come up so close, then retreat fast.In other cases, some IBD 50 names act as if the 20% profit level is merely a pit stop. Indeed, in recent years, scores of high-quality growth stocks have risen 30%, 40%, 50% or even more past a proper buy point before sinking into a real correction. When you have supreme conviction and the overall market is healthy, go ahead and sit longer on your winners.But Casa Systems (CASA), which has occupied a spot in the IBD 50 for months, illustrates the importance of not being too greedy.The specialist in software for the cable and telecom markets debuted on the Nasdaq at 13 a share on Dec. 15, formed a very narrow IPO base in February, then broke out past a 22.60 entry on Feb. 27. On that day, the market was in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to a follow-through rally. Less than four weeks later, Casa hit a high of 34.21, up a stout 51%.Taking at least some gains turned out to be sound portfolio management. Casa cooled off and tried to clear a faulty cup base that lasted just four weeks. On April 24, shares plunged nearly 12% and undercut the 50-day moving average for the first time on news of a share offering. Two days later, Casa priced 7 million shares at 25 each. The share float was 20 million.Casa is also likely getting knocked by news that Charter Communications (CHTR) reported worse than expected results in video subscriber losses.Here's a quick look at some other IBD 50 names' recent action.Abiomed (ABMD): It's holding up fine after fading after a breakout past 304.38 in a new flat base. The base is late stage, a key risk. Keep in mind that the gains from a March 2017 breakout at 120.99 have hit 150%.Smart Global (SGH): Made a round trip after rising past a buy point in March and catapulting over four weeks. The stock made a sharp retreat, even after earnings roared 652% higher to $1.73 a share in the quarter ended in February. Revenue rose 83% to $314 million.Illumina (ILMN): A base next to a base is forming. Clear resistance is seen near 250.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM): Is not giving much back after it cleared a base with a 26.29 buy point. Gains have so far hit 13% amid a new bull run for crude oil prices.You can trade the IBD 50 in one click with Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), managed by Innovator Capital.

44,ABMD,"When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA, bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (AKA, technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.TIP: For an even deeper understanding of how chart patterns work, read more about the concept and psychology behind bases.From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.Nvidia Breakout From Cup With HandleWhen Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out.

But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.Can You Spot The Pattern?Look at a weekly chart for Micron Technology (MU). Can you see the double bottom it formed from June to August 2017?Learn More About Double BottomsAs the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.Here are the key elements of a flat base:Netflix Breakout From Flat BaseNetflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can spot the powerful breakout Abiomed (ABMD) launched from a flat base in early January of this year.Learn More About Flat BasesGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Improve Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

47,ABMD,"A trade war. Rising interest rates. Anti-EU sentiment in Europe. A nuclear showdown with North Korea. After a series of worries — or even shocks — to start the year, what jolts await in the stock market forecast for the next six months?After an unusually calm and productive 2017 for the major stock indexes, 2018 has been like a ride over sand dunes. The S&P 500 ended a 10-month winning streak in February. The market that seemed unflappable in 2017 became sensitive to headlines and faced new risks.The first tremors came Feb. 5. Stocks plunged as new inflation signs sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high of 2.88%. The Nasdaq went on to slide nearly 12% in February, its worst decline in two years. For the first time since June 2016, IBD's market outlook was downgraded to ""correction.""The market recovered, but the volatility remains with the recent gyrations over the tit-for-tat trade drama.""We're in the late stages of one of the longest bull markets in U.S. history, and this year's volatility comes as investors wonder when and how it could end. Every potential threat is magnified,"" Christopher M. Hyzy, chief investment officer for Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management, said in a midyear review.Yet for all its mood swings, the stock market made progress in the first half comparable to the six-month mark of 2017. The Nasdaq is still the leader, up 8.8%, with the S&P 500 up just 1.7%. At the end of June 2017, the Nasdaq was up 14.1% and the S&P 500 8.2%. The Dow has lagged more. It's down 1.8% compared with a year-ago gain of 8%.Growth investors who have navigated the ups and down have found plenty of opportunities. Dozens of breakouts have resulted in sizable gains. Heart implant maker Abiomed (ABMD) soared as much as 125% from a breakout in early January. Adobe Systems (ADBE) climbed nearly 40% from a January breakout. Leaderboard, one of two IBD stock-picking products, is up about 18% in the first six months.But the current stock market faces big hurdles. Trade disputes with China, Canada and other nations threaten to raise costs for many industries and consumers. Some fear President Trump's tariffs may trigger a full-blown trade war and a recession. The Federal Reserve has signaled four interest-rate increases for this year, one more than was forecast at the end of last year. Foreign markets are much weaker than a year ago. Will these risks derail the market?Right now the IBD's Market Pulse puts the rally under pressure. Think of it as a caution flag in the wake of heavy selling in the latest week. But if the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can regain their footing yet again and push higher for the rest of year, the credit will likely go to four themes driving the current stock market.By asset class, small-cap stocks have been a big driver of the 2018 market. The Russell 2000 is up 7%. That's nearly as much as the Nasdaq, which has been dominated by major gains from Amazon (AMZN) (45%) and Netflix (NFLX) (105%). President Trump's push for import tariffs and retaliatory moves have made small caps relatively more attractive because of their domestic focus. In other words, small-cap stocks have less exposure to foreign markets.There are other reasons. Last year's tax cut reduced the effective tax rate of Russell 2000 companies from 33% to 21%, says Scott Hood, CEO and Portfolio Manager for First Wilshire Securities, a Los Angeles firm that specializes in small caps.By sector, technology, health care and financials have contributed the most to small caps' performance. This year's outperformance in small-cap stocks reflects a shift from a period that saw big caps dominate, Hood says.""Small cap returns are similar to large caps for the trailing five, four and three years, but small caps begin to pull ahead in periods of two years or shorter,"" Hood said.But value stocks have lagged among small-cap stocks. It's been the growth camp of small caps that shouldered the increase. The Russell 2000 growth index is up about 15% this year, vs. 8% for the Russell 2000 value index.Larger stocks show a similar trend. The S&P 500 Value index declined 3.5%, while the S&P 500 Growth index was more than 6% higher over the same period.Big earnings gains typically drive the best stocks higher. The same generally is true for the overall stock market. S&P 500 earnings growth in the first quarter topped 20% for the first since 2010, extending a sharp recovery in profits. S&P earnings rose 25% in Q1 as nine of 11 S&P sector posted double-digit gains, according to FactSet. Q1 also had a record number of profit surprises, with 77% of companies beating EPS estimates. That ties for the highest since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. Technology had the highest percentage of beats: 90% of companies exceeded earnings forecasts.But the excellent earnings didn't necessarily translate to big rewards for shareholders. Stocks often had a muted response to strong results, and data show it's getting harder to impress investors.S&P 500 companies that beat expectations in Q1 saw their share prices rise a modest 0.2% on average in the two days before and the two days after the earnings report, FactSet found. That's way below the five-year average increase of 1.1% for earnings beaters. That's the fifth consecutive quarter that profit winners lag the five-year average. In Q2 and Q4 of last year, the price reaction to positive profits was negative, on average.As profits expand, comparisons will become harder to beat. Some moderation in profit growth is expected. FactSet estimates that for the second quarter, companies are expected to report earnings growth of 19% and revenue gains of 8.7%. For Q3, earnings are expected to grow 21.4% and revenue 7.5%. For Q4, profits are seen rising 17.2% and revenue 5.8%. For the whole of 2018, earnings are estimated to rise 19.8% and sales 7.6%. Upward revisions to these numbers would push the market higher, while lowered expectations could become a serious drag.Among 67 stocks in IBD's database that went public this year, the average gain from the IPO price is more than 30%. That includes winners such as Huya (HUYA), DocuSign (DOCU) and iQiyi (IQ), which have given back big chunks of their advances.The IPOX index, which tracks stocks that have gone public in a trailing four-year period, is up 7.5% this year. That's in line with the Jan. 1-June 22 average for the past five years of 8.3%, according to Chicago-based IPOX Schuster. From a year-ago level, the index was up 21.7%.Pay special attention to new companies that are profitable and growing, or at least expect to turn profitable. Take Huya, which analysts expect will grow earnings in the triple digits the next two years.In 2017, foreign stocks and ETFs generally performed about as well as Wall Street. Many experts expected them to outperform in 2018 partly due to high U.S. stock valuations. But in fact, the U.S. is nearly alone, far outperforming major global indexes and emerging markets.Each region and country seems to have its own reason for flopping this year, whether it was corruption, trade squabbles, a populist wave or a commodity shock. But if there was a single factor that touched foreign markets, it's been the strength of the U.S. dollar, says Dina Ting, Head of Global Index Portfolio Management at Franklin Templeton's LibertyShares ETF family.In Asia, for example, Japan is a bedrock of good valuations, low unemployment and solid fundamentals, Ting says. Brazil, where the Bovespa's 20% drop this year, would qualify as a bear market, and Templeton sees an attractive market. The firm offers exposure to Brazil with its Franklin FTSE Brazil ETF (FLBR). Brazil's sell-off, Ting adds, ""has been priced into the markets already.""IBD's 2018 market outlook on Jan. 1 noted that since 1963, the S&P 500 averages a 7.5% gain in the years following a 15% or higher annual gain. So far this year, the S&P lags that average, but is still higher.The question is: Will this continue? The return of market volatility makes forecasting the second half of 2018 more difficult. Three factors loom large.Companies facing new tariffs were punished twice: first by the risk of higher costs and then by investors who sold off shares. On June 21, for example, Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars will likely hurt profits. Daimler's U.S. shares fell 4.5% on the news; Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) skidded 5.9%. Many Chinese stocks were bludgeoned in June as tariff issues intensified.Each headline on tariffs also shook the broad stock market. But with no clear direction on tariff policy, U.S. indexes often battled back from tariff-related selling. For example, on June 20, when the European Commission approved a 25% duty on $3.2 billion of imports on U.S. products, the Nasdaq made a new high.The looming trade war is the biggest uncertainty on Wall Street. While all-out conflict has yet to materialize, some economists sense a growing danger. President Trump's mercurial views on the subject only add to the uncertainty.""A decline in confidence and supply chain disruptions could amplify the trade shock, leading to an outright recession,"" Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist, warned in a research note. ""We continue to believe that the probability of a full blown trade war is low, but the risks are rising and it remains a key uncertainty to our outlook.""As the Federal Reserve has grown hawkish, the yield curve has flattened. Some analysts wonder if the Fed will overshoot its target, the type of policy error that has marred the central bank in the past. Just like it was in February when the stock market crumpled, monetary risk remains an issue with broad implications.Whenever the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, it's a pretty good signal that a recession looms. The U.S. is not there yet, but the trend is headed in that direction. The spread between the two yields was 100 basis points a year ago. Today, it is around 35 basis points.""We are actually concerned about the shape of the yield curve because market worries of a 'Fed mistake' are gaining real traction,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a June 18 note. ""The yield curve seems destined to go to zero in the next 3 to 6 months. After that, the recession fuse is lit and stocks can still rise but they are living on borrowed time.""Polls continue to show the Republican Party losing control of the House of Representatives in November, although the margin is narrowing. But with Senate control and Trump in office, the GOP would still wield considerable power in Washington.""We think it is fair to say that markets have embraced the business-friendly aspects of a Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. At the margin, they would therefore prefer this status quo over a shift in House control to Democrats,"" Colas said on June 21.""The cross currents of sector/market cap returns year to date do not indicate a strong market view on midterm elections. ... Regional bank stocks — one group with clear exposure to Republican-led deregulation — have done well this year. While a Democrat-led House could not reverse recent bank-friendly moves, they could certainly stop any future initiatives. This is certainly one group to watch going into midterms.""It's impossible to predict the stock market one month out, let alone to the end of the year. But so far the 2018 stock market shows scant signs of a major breakdown. The IBD/TIPP Poll in June saw its Economic Optimism Index at 53.9, well above the 50 neutral level. Americans' view of their personal finances strengthened. The six-month economic outlook was at 51.2, below 55-plus readings in the two months after President Trump signed the tax cuts into law in December.The unemployment rate in June was close to a 50-year low. The Conference Board forecasts GDP will accelerated in the second quarter to 3.3% (from a 2% rise in Q1) and increase a bit more to 3.5% in Q3 and Q4.The IBD 50 list of the market's best growth stocks is up more than 16% this year, outpacing even the hot Nasdaq and Russell 2000. The leading sectors include software, apparel, retail, health care and consumer stocks — hardly a picture of despair.To be sure, growth stocks are relatively pricey. Value stocks are at the cheapest levels since at least 2005, while growth stocks are at the highest relative valuation since 2005.""All this suggests that it might be viewed as a good time to rotate into value and out of growth. We don't necessarily agree,"" wrote CFRA Research Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell. ""While valuation is important, we can't ignore that technology accounts for at least 40% of the Growth indices (and only 7% of the Value index). Because of that, we believe the growth rally can continue over the next several months, if not through the end of this year.""While cautioning that the U.S. economic expansion is in the late innings, Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2800 to 2900, up 4.8% to 8.5%.""Our favorable outlook for most U.S. equities is based on a broadening economic recovery, driven by household and business spending,"" strategists Sameer Samana and Scott Wren wrote in the bank's 2018 Midyear Outlook. ""Faster economic growth and modest inflation should drive corporate sales growth."" The corporate tax cut should result in ""significant margin expansion.""Other institutions echo those sentiments. Wells Fargo's main picks for the remainder of 2018 are financials, industrials and consumer discretionary — cyclical sectors that tend to benefit the most from rising interest rates.A choppy market makes it harder for investors to hold for sizable profits.

49,ABMD,"Arista Networks is a four-year-old cloud stock, a toddler that quickly rose to big-cap status. The coming two quarters presents a test, as the company runs up against two quarters of steep earnings and sales gains in its year-earlier period.Arista Networks (ANET) makes switches and other hardware components for cloud-based networks in large data center and campus-type computing settings. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has become a fierce competitor of Cisco Systems (CSCO). The question is, just how much ground has Cisco taken back in the market for high-performance networking switches?Arista's stock has been basing since February, waiting for a clear answer to that question.During that period, it has formed a four-month base. The base began with a harsh sell-off Feb. 15, as investors responded to comments made during the company's fourth-quarter conference call with analysts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArista had reported a stronger-than-forecast 43% revenue gain and a 62% increase in earnings. Management called 2017 ""a tipping point,"" during which the company's network switches became a mainstay cloud technology providing more than 15 million ports.At the same time, the company said 2017's strong performance meant it would face ""tough comparables"" in 2018. Chief financial officer Ita Brennan projected revenue growth would moderate to the mid-20s, vs. 46% in 2017.The stock dove below its 10-week line. After repeated tests of that low over the next two months, in its first quarter report Arista again topped analysts' sales and earnings targets. Second quarter revenue guidance, however, only narrowly topped expectations.That sent shares for yet another test of its low on May 4. Arista then began to rebound. It has since retaken its 50-day moving average. On Monday, it was up almost 19% from its May 4 low. It now trades less than 8% below a 301.41 buy point in a double-bottom base.For the current quarter, analysts project a 27% earnings-per-share gain to $1.70 and a 26% rise in revenue. If realized, it would be the company's slowest quarter on both lines since at least Q3 2013. Gradually slowing growth is a hallmark of maturing companies and, if well-handled by management, often not a negative for a stock.Arista, which had its IPO in 2014, is still relatively young. But its revenue has grown nearly threefold since 2014, and the its market capitalization quickly expanded to more than $20 billion, giving it big-cap status. At the same time, shares turned in a 465% advance between March and February of 2016. That left the stock in sore need of a breather.From that technical point of view, the current consolidation was due. In fact, investors might be better off if Arista had pulled back all the way below 206 — the low if its prior base. That would have reset the base count.Instead, the stock is gestating in a fourth-stage base. That is late stage, meaning a breakout from the pattern bears more risk than it would if the base had pulled back and reset to become a first-stage structure.But, the market has recently produced a number of leaders able to power out gains well into late stage charts. TAL Education (TAL) is currently struggling to maintain a breakout above a 10th stage base. Heart device maker Abiomed (ABMD) was up 46% on Monday, since clearing a sixth-stage flat base in early May.The point is, being a late-stage stock shouldn't on its own be enough to scare off investors. But precautions should be taken, because late-stage status implies the stock could sell off very quickly if things start to go wrong.RELATED:IBD Stock Of The DayIBD Stock Of The Day: Paycom Nears Buy Point With Earnings Growth Set To AccelerateIPO Stock With 100% Growth May Follow Path Of Alibaba, Facebook OPEC Faces Crumbling Consensus As This Creates Sharp SplitThese 4 Stock Giants Are Near Buy Points

53,ABMD,"The outlook for growth stocks is good, based on projections for corporate earnings growth, say mutual fund managers that IBD spoke with. What managers aren't sure of is whether the pace of corporate earnings growth — and thus the outlook for growth stocks — will continue to speed up.""We continue to see a constructive environment for earnings,"" said Charles Shriver, lead manager of $2.5 billion T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $437.4 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. ""But earnings may have hit a peak in the first quarter. We do still see opportunities. But they will be driven more by individual names.""But John Wilson, lead manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (LEGAX), sees an ongoing clear runway for growth stocks in the technology space, where he finds the bulk of his opportunities. ""We continue to have a strong earnings backdrop,"" he said. ""In technology in May, we saw a continuation of many of the same trends we saw in 2017: strength as companies moved to digitize their business operations, and an ongoing move to more digitization moving forward.""And digitization is getting a boost from federal government policy. ""A lot of companies have additional cash flow from tax reform last year, so we see companies deploying that within technology and other capital projects to improve their competitiveness,"" Wilson said. ""That helped outperformance in May by technology stocks and growth stocks more broadly.""The S&P 500 gained 2.41% in May.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBest Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportSmall caps thrived amid headlines that drove investors to seek safe havens in U.S. stocks. The on-and-off prospect of a trade war was one factor that pushed investors into small caps, which tend to derive the bulk of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., said Shriver.In addition, May headlines focused attention on Italy, which was about to elect a populist coalition that is seen as skeptical of the European Union. ""When there is concern about overseas events, U.S. small caps tend to outperform,"" Wilson said.Reflecting that tilt toward U.S. stocks, world equity funds lagged U.S. diversified stock funds, losing 1.09% on average last month.China region funds were the only foreign stock fund category to gain in May, climbing 2.82%. In sharp contrast, Latin American funds plunged 12.48%.Among sectors, science/technology funds outpaced all other categories, gaining 6.29% in May. Global sci-tech funds were close behind, rising 6.12%. Health/biotechnology funds tacked on 4.82%. The energy sector was also strong.Wilson said the digitization trend benefits growth stocks that enable customers to shift to cloud computing from on-premise software. It also benefits companies that are involved in digital advertising and marketing, he said. ""Whether it is Microsoft (MSFT) or Adobe (ADBE) or Salesforce.com (CRM) or ServiceNow (NOW), we're seeing strong end demand drivers based on the need for a lot of corporate America to take important steps to make themselves part of the growth in the digital economy,"" Wilson said.Microsoft continues to benefit from growth in its Azure cloud computing service. ""Microsoft is doing a strong job of using their legacy enterprise relationships to help companies migrate their business processes and operations to the cloud,"" Wilson said.Wilson added that corporate America sees the shift to the cloud as a key strategy for survival. Two to four years ago, companies' purchasing managers talked with Microsoft about their computing needs.

70,ABMD,"Top growth stocks with impressive fundamentals are ubiquitous in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. So are top growth stocks getting support at the 10-week moving average.But there are important questions to ask when a leading growth stock tests support at the 10-week line. Is the market in a confirmed uptrend or is the uptrend under pressure? Is the test coming after a breakout from a late-stage base? Have there been multiple tests of support already? Also, is the test coming in light or heavy volume? Answers to these questions can give you an idea if the stock under scrutiny has more gas left in the tank.Heath care name Abiomed (ABMD) has been a mainstay in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. It's currently testing support at the 10-week line for the first time after a breakout from a flat base in early May.The stock has made a huge move in recent months, helped by booming earnings and sales growth. Even after a big run, the fact that the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend strengthens the case for a legitimate bounce off the 10-week line.Some might look at Abiomed's weekly chart and say its last breakout emerged from a late-stage base. It's a valid argument since Abiomed technically never reset its base count during its lengthy run-up. A stock resets its base count when the low of a base undercuts the low of a prior base. The thinking is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more gains.However, a lengthy consolidation that started in October 2016 arguably shook enough sellers out to qualify as a base reset. That means Abiomed's last breakout was from a third-stage base.To reiterate, it's a first test of the 10-week line for Abiomed, but the stock has not made a convincing case for support yet. That said, Abiomed showed constructive price action last week, closing in the upper half of its weekly range after touching the 10-week line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

73,ABMD,"Abiomed (ABMD) stock provides a good example of handling profits in swing trading. A stock market rally starts, you book quick profits then avoid sideways action. Do that often enough, while keeping losses small, and you can have a phenomenal year of gains.A critical component of Abiomed's success was a powerful stock market rally behind it. Abiomed stock joined IBD's SwingTrader on Feb. 14. That same day, the stock market confirmed its rally attempt with a follow-through day (1). Whereas the market sliced through its 50-day moving average, Abiomed's consolidation held well above that moving average line. When the market turns, these higher relative strength stocks often show the most powerful moves. Abiomed also posted strong volume (1) at its 244.61 entry when it cleared an area of resistance from six days prior. By the day's close, we were already up 4.4% on our swing trade.The following day, we booked half profits as Abiomed stock passed its 5% profit goal (2). Swing trading strategy relies on taking some money off the table with explosive gains. Keeping a partial position allows you to participate if the stock goes up more. But, if the stock pulls back as quickly as it rose, you will have a better average exit price with an early sell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn this case, Abiomed continued upward. We sold the remaining shares as the stock approached its 10% profit goal (3). Two main factors guided the decision. The stock hit resistance intraday and was on a 22% tear in just six days. That usually requires a break. Over the next week or so, the stock went sideways.It wasn't the end of the story for Abiomed. The stock staged another powerful gain (4) with another stock market rally underway on March 2. We passed on this swing trade in favor of another, dating product provider Match Group (MTCH). A deciding element was better volume for Match. Both stocks shot up the next seven days but when Abiomed topped (5) on March 12, Match ran a couple of extra days. Volume often acts as fuel for stock moves. The more you have at the start, the longer your move can last.The stock market rally that started Feb. 14 did show some contrasts to our latest follow-through day on April 10. First, the fall that preceded it was steeper. That can often lead to an equal reaction the opposite way — a bullish bounce. The most recent fall transpired slower and also spent some time with buyers and sellers trading blows. Headlines seemed to pull sentiment violently one way or the other. By the time the follow-through happened April 10, the major market indexes had failed repeatedly to break recent resistance.The quality of setups also shifted. Rather than high relative strength stocks with accompanying volume, the stronger stocks haven't had volume and the weaker, beaten-down stocks seem to be getting more of the action. A change in that trend and further gains in the overall market could provide more swing trading opportunities.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits: Knowing When To Say WhenMatch Shows That Stocks Deserve Second ChancesLet The Market Shape Your Swing Trading StrategySwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

The fund's strong performance this year has been fueled by holdings that include such leading growth stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU), TransUnion (TRU) and Five Below (FIVE).Gains this year by those stocks range from 30% by TransUnion to 104% by Netflix and 118% by Abiomed.Relative performance has ramped up for this growth fund this year as many holdings have posted solid financial results. ""The first quarter was particularly strong for us with many stocks reporting good earnings and an unusually low number of misses (in comparison to analysts' forecasts),"" co-manager Paul Gordon said.Solid stock picking has been another factor. The market tide is no longer rising, lifting all boats. ""Volatility in markets has picked up and correlations have dropped,"" Gordon said.

""With 125 million paying subscriber base, there's a significant long-term runway for that number to go higher, based on the number of people in the world paying for TV and connected to the internet,"" Gordon said.Also, Netflix share price — which set all-time highs above 400 in June — got a boost when the company demonstrated pricing power in a series of price hikes. ""What the market really liked was that there was no significant change in the number of people who unplugged because of price increases,"" Gordon said.IBD'S TAKE: Keep your eye on Netflix by checking in to IBD's online page devoted to news and analysis focused on the content provider.Athletic apparel maker Lululemon's quarterly EPS growth has accelerated, growing 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% the past four stanzas.

Gordon attributes it to getting past quality and assortment problems that weighed on company performance.""After several years of operational issues that distracted the company, they've come out strong on the innovation side, both in women's and men's apparel,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began to buy TransUnion in November after deciding to exit Equifax (EFX) in the wake of its data breach scandal. ""We think there is a need for their (credit reporting) product,"" Gordon said. ""We think the Equifax issues were isolated and that it's possible TransUnion could gain market share as a result.""The MFS team likes TransUnion in its own right. ""We believe TransUnion could have above-industry growth from innovation in its core credit (business) that will make credit decisions more accurate and thereby drive pricing,"" Gordon said.He also says the company should benefit from further penetration into the health care, auto and insurance markets, and from greater exposure to emerging markets.Five Below's price discounts and focus on a teen market help insulate it from the problems dogging many brick-and-mortar retailers. ""They are more isolated from the Amazon (AMZN) threat,"" Gordon said. ""Like other dollar-store or off-price concepts, they offer a treasure hunt to their younger skewed demographic. It also has one of the longest runways for store growth in all of retail.""The chain now operates more than 400 stores, ""and long-term they believe they could operate over 2,000,"" Gordon said. ""It will take longer than five years at their current rate of growth.""The chain benefited last year from strong sales of Fidget Spinners. Five Below posted strong comparable sales in its latest quarter, surprising investors who expected a letdown after the Fidget Spinner fad. ""This showed that the company can comp impressively without the benefit of a hot trend,"" Gordon said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeMillennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A Millionaire

BP (BP), Abiomed (ABMD) are also top stocks breaking out along with Apple, while  Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are near buy points.The 50-day moving average is traditionally an important support level for the S&P 500 and other major averages — as well as individual stocks — but in recent months it's been a resistance area. Friday was only the fourth day since March 21 that the Nasdaq composite has closed above the 50-day line. The Dow Jones has only been above its 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 2.So the stock market rally is at a key juncture.

89,ABMD,"U.S. stocks got off to a riveting start to the new year, particularly in the tech sectors, as Apple (AAPL) behaved the way one would expect for a leading stock that is testing support at a key technical juncture.X Apple, the global consumer electronics and digital services play, rose more than 1.7% to 172.36 and bounced off its rising 50-day moving average.The 50-day line, which graphs a stock's average closing price over the trailing 50 trading sessions, has been rising ever since the stock edged slowly after a key breakout from an early-stage base at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017. Gains from that breakout from a solid cup with handle reached nearly 50%.More recently, Apple on Oct. 27 cleared a new second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 and volume was brisk, 64% above the stock's 50-day average turnover.Apple and fellow Nasdaq tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL) (up 1.9% to 1,073.21, now extended past a recent flat base entry at 1,006.29) helped lead the Nasdaq composite up 1.5% by day's end. The Nasdaq soared 28.2% in 2017, its best annual gain in four years.The Nasdaq 100 rallied nearly 1.8%; the index-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), also up almost 1.8%, is now 28 cents below the all-time high of 158.77.The S&P 500 rallied more than 0.6% as investors also scooped up shares in infrastructure and building materials firms (please see the prior Stock Market Today column for more details), top Chinese company ADRs that are highly profitable and growing strong revenues, steel, automaker and generic drug groups.The Steel-Producers group is shaping up as Tuesday's top performer among the 197 groups tracked each day by IBD (see the entire list by going to Data Tables within the Stock Lists section of Investors.com).Strength in Apple, Chevron (CVX) (extended after a December breakout past a base on base at 120.99) and Walt Disney (DIS) (forming a new base) helped the Dow Jones industrial average edge 0.2% higher, overcoming a sell-off in insurance titan Travelers (TRV).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got off to a great start in 2018, rising at one point 15% to an intraday high of 2,320 in dull trading. At the end of 2017, even after a deep four-session plunge that took the Bitcoin-tracking ETF from as high as 3,522 to as low as 1,155, Bitcoin Investment still finished the year with a 1,556% return.It's likely that interest in Bitcoin is set to only rise, given the growing acceptance of e-commerce, digital transactions, concerns over the unusual gains in U.S. and other equities in 2017, and the relative ""newness"" of the alternative currency. The fact that both the CME Group and Cboe now conduct futures trading in Bitcoin is one of this currency's greatest accomplishments over the past few months.Watch to see how Bitcoin Investment acts around both the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. The latter has been catching up some, now well above 1,400. But the 50-day moving average, which usually acts as an excellent defense-oriented sell signal when a growth stock torpedoes through it in huge volume, has not been an effective timing indicator for this ultrahot ETF.Going back to Apple, amid all the speculation that the iPhone marketer is going to go on a huge shopping spree, investors should continue to simply monitor the price-and-volume action on a daily or weekly basis. And so far, the action remains healthy. One big reason is the possibility for further double-digit top and bottom line growth.Two, earnings growth may accelerate.The Street sees earnings rising 24% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.46 a share, up from an 11% jump in FY 2017 (ended in September that year). Services revenue is one big part of that picture. New products or new editions of the iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch form another big part.Apple's ratings on Stock Checkup remain good, including a 90 Composite Rating and a decent B- grade for Accumulation/Distribution, which hints that fund managers are net buyers over the past 13 weeks of trading. The Accumulation grade goes from The C rating is neutral.In the medical sector, heart pump innovator Abiomed (ABMD) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) continue to show leadership.The former rose more than 3% to 192.49, retaking its 50-day moving average in quiet yet rising turnover. Watch for a potential new flat base to form, possibly presenting a 200.38 entry.Abbott, a diversified pharmaceuticals, medical products and diagnostic systems giant, rallied more than 3% to 58.79 and new highs in steep turnover. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a narrow and shallow flat base with a 56.79 buy point.The 5% buy zone for Abbott, which has scored three quarters in a row of double-digit top and bottom line growth (EPS up 17%, 13% and 12% while revenue is up 30%, 24% and 29%), goes up to 59.63.Abiomed is a member of IBD's Sector Leaders growth stock screen.Investors dumped utility stocks as interest rates rose.The Dow utility average fell nearly 1.1% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped sharply to 2.47%. The yield is near last month's peak of 2.49%. On Dec. 13, the Federal Reserve hiked the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans for the fifth time since December 2015. The new target rate is now 1.25%-1.5%.RELATED:This Tech Breaks Out Today: Stocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Invest In 2018: What To Do For Better ResultsHot Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50Can You Spot The Next Major Stock Market Top?

102,ABMD,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — Medical device makers were split Tuesday on whether new Trump administration health chiefs Scott Gottlieb and Tom Price would help or hurt their industry, but all agree that Congress should've already repealed an unpopular tax on the devices, the companies said at a conference.XThe medical device excise tax has been suspended since 2016, but is set to go back into effect in 2018. Before that, sector players are hopeful that Congress will permanently repeal the 2.3% tax that manufacturers and importers must pay on all medical devices.Still, Paul LaViollette, managing partner specializing in the medical device field at venture capital firm SV Health Investors, argued that the issue should have been put to bed a long time ago. Instead it's been wrapped up in President Donald Trump's attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.""When we worked really hard three years ago to put the tax into repeal and suspension for 24 months, we didn't feel 21-22 months later we'd be back and nothing would have been done,"" he said. ""And yet, we can't get that done.""LaViollette was among a panel of players in the medical device field speaking during the MedTech Conference in San Jose, Calif. He noted that support to permanently repeal the tax is bipartisan and it will likely get another suspension.""That's a low ask,"" he said. ""It's a small amount of money, everyone supports its repeal, and yet here we are again two years later with a Republican-controlled government and (being) unable to having something permanent probably speaks to the fact we're not where we should be.""IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have climbed higher this year amid drug-pricing worries plaguing the biotech and pharma groups. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deep dive on what could help them spike higher.J.C. Scott, chief advocacy officer and head of external affairs for AdvaMed, doesn't necessarily think Congress will become more functional. But he is optimistic that it will deal with deadline-driven issues like the medical device tax.Yet with the upcoming election year, a number of bipartisan issues — including the medical device tax — could end up stalled in the political machinery. There will be 33 Senate seats up for contention, along with all the House seats. So 2018 won't bring more harmony, he said.""This could become a political exercise really, really fast,"" he said. ""We'll really have to work to thread the needle. But we're in a good position.""Medtech panelists were more split on Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services. Both assumed office earlier this year after their appointments by Trump.Scott says he's seen ""positive signals"" from the new agency leads, but acknowledges that most have been embroiled in crisis after crisis as hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have ravaged parts of Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.""They haven't had a lot of time to roll out their policy agendas,"" he said.Still, Mark Leahey, chief executive of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association, is optimistic. These new agency leads seem to understand that when it comes to medical devices, firms are working to ensure their products remain durable for five years and more, he says.Gottlieb and Price also seem to understand the ability of the sector to take ""costs out of the system and improve care,"" Leahey said.LaViollette, though, wasn't as bullish. In the past several years, medical device makers have had to go on the defensive when it comes to dealing with regulators. Under the new administration, it's ""way too early to tell"" whether that will remain the case, he said.""I would like to have a sense of policy clarity and then put that into practice,"" he said. ""There have been far too many distractions with the ACA.""He added: ""We can easily get harmed by the unplanned, unwitting change and it's too soon to tell if that's going to happen.""RELATED:FDA Chief Gottlieb Addresses Opioids, Cancer, New TherapiesQuest LabCorp Are Big 'Losers' Under Medicare Overhaul: AnalystThis Biotech Craters 70% On Late-Stage Alzheimer's Drug Failure

It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

155,ABMD,"In relationships, when a person breaks your trust, they may never get a second chance. In swing trading, however, you may miss out on a lot of profits if you avoid stocks that have burned you in the past. It's useful to remember that stocks aren't people.XYou could take the position that a stock handing you a loss is never worth revisiting. But there are plenty of cases where, for whatever reason, the timing is just slightly off. Maybe the market was still putting pressure on the stock, or it just needed a little more time to carve out a longer handle in its base pattern. If your original thesis is still valid and the stock sets up, it can be worth it to try again.Take the action in Abiomed (ABMD) from a year ago. The stock was added to IBD's SwingTrader on June 7 as it was breaking out of a seven-week base (1). Volume was the highest in over a month, but below average, a black mark for a base that long. A few days later, the stock closed below its 5-day moving average line and it was removed with a 1.2% loss (2). The market was also flattening at this time and went through a mild correction. Removing the stock prevented a loss of 6% over the next couple weeks and the tumult of the ""Brexit"" vote.After Brexit, however, the market quickly reversed and provided a lot of opportunities. Abiomed was one of the participants and picking the stock up on June 28 (3) saw a 10% increase over the next 10 days. The stock didn't make it on the SwingTrader list that time due to a dance card that was already full — names like MarketAxess (MKTX), Dycom (DY), and Amazon (AMZN) provided their own 10% returns. But the stock did stay on our radar.On July 29, Abiomed reversed from a two-week pullback and was added to SwingTrader (4). We had a loss on our first attempt, missed out on a second attempt, but we were still OK adding it, even 15% above our last exit. Since we had the quick and robust post-Brexit gains locked in, we were happy to take a quick 5% gain in just over a week's time. Abiomed was removed on strength (5) on Aug. 9. After inching up a bit more, it went through another pullback to its 50-day line. If it hadn't been sold into strength, the exit would have come a few days later on Aug. 16 as it fell below its 5-day moving average.More details on Past Trades are available to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Going Back To The Well Can Compound Stock ProfitsTake Stock Profits On The Way Up To Compound GainsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

157,ABMD,"Medtronic (MDT) shares sank early Tuesday after the maker of medical devices reported fiscal first-quarter sales that lagged Wall Street estimates, though adjusted profit beat by 4 cents a share.In early trading on the stock market today, Medtronic dropped 2.1% to close at 81.76. Shares fell well below a flat base that began forming in late June with an 89.82 buy point. Meanwhile, IBD's ninth-ranked Medical-Products industry group advanced 0.6%.Medtronic reported $7.39 billion in sales, up 3%, but that fell short of the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $7.45 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share beat the $1.08 view and grew 9%.Medtronic's restorative therapies and minimally invasive therapies businesses contributed to the revenue miss, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. But Novarro kept his outperform rating on the company.Restorative therapies include work on the spine and brain, as well as pain management. Sales in that unit rose 2% to $1.81 billion, but missed views for $1.84 billion. Minimally invasive therapies include surgical and monitoring/recovery; this business grew 3% to $2.49 billion but missed by $28 million.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Still, it lags top performers like Abiomed (ABMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), which have CRs of 99. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at strong performers.Cardiac and vascular sales advanced 5% to $2.65 billion, but were a tad light. Medtronic noted that adoption of its CoreValve Evolut Pro platform in the U.S. helped drive high-30% growth, excluding foreign exchange rates, in sales of its transcatheter heart-valve replacements.Diabetes tech sales, though, fell 1% to $449 million, missing by $25 million. The group was temporarily affected by a limited supply of some glucose sensors, Medtronic said in a news release.Medtronic reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 4%-5% sales growth and 9%-10% adjusted EPS growth, excluding foreign exchange rates. But it cut views for diabetes sales to 1%-4% growth from its prior 10%-12% outlook. Its cardiac forecast was boosted to 5.5%-7% growth.RELATED:This Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyRobot-Surgeon Maker Bests Q2 Sales, Profits ViewsThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

193,ABMD,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers.

Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

212,ABMD,"Chinese internet and top-rated medical plays showed strength amid a dull showing by major indexes in late-afternoon trading Monday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite gained more upside in the final half hour of trading, rising 0.5%, and Apple (AAPL) looked poised to post a sixth straight session on the north side of the 50-day moving average.X The action by Apple is critical, not only to the stock but the greater market, given Apple's heft. The iPhone and iPad giant has a market cap of $790 billion. And the recent action represents an opportunity to buy shares near 149 as the stock stages its second follow-on entry point after breaking out of a bottoming-base pattern Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.The first follow-on entry came in late March as Apple surpassed a 3-weeks-tight pattern at 141.12, justifying the addition of a small number of shares to an already profitable core position in the stock.The 118.12 entry comes from adding 10 cents to the handle's high in a cup-with-handle base that formed from Oct. 11 through Jan. 5 of this year. After the Jan. 6-9 breakout, Apple has gained as much as 32.5%, triggering a key IBD rule to sell at least a partial position of shares when the gain hits 20% to 25%.Apple, featured in IBD's Stock Market Today column last week as it retook the 50-day line, gained 1.4% to 152.32, helping the Nasdaq composite edge more than 0.4% higher. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3% and tacked on a new all-time high.The S&P 500 is up fractionally and is trying to avoid a third straight decline, giving up a trifling 0.1% over that time frame. The Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.2%, hurt by losses of 1 point or more in at least four of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD) (falling further below the 50-day moving average, a sell signal for recent new holders), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) (down 1.7% to 133.01, but holding above the 50-day line and up 3.5% from a 128.47 cup-with-handle buy point) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (building a new potential saucer pattern, still up significantly from an October breakout past 172.52).The Russell 2000 eked out a small gain, up nearly 0.2%. Volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq and sharply slower on the NYSE vs. the same time in the prior session.Chinese consumer and e-commerce plays continued to surge, even as the Hong Kong and mainland China equity markets were closed for a holiday.Baidu (BIDU)'s breakout past a 193.84 buy point is gaining more momentum as the stock rallied nearly 3% to 198.72. Volume is running more than 40% higher than normal. Read more about the Chinese search engine's chart action and other market leaders in IBD's New Highs feature.The permissible buy zone for Baidu goes up to 203.53, 5% past the 193.84 handle entry.Baozun (BZUN) has emerged as a runaway small-cap winner. On Monday, shares gapped up more than 5%, to 34.10, in fast turnover and are now up more than 92% since clearing a long cup-with-handle base at 17.68 on May 5.Notice on a daily chart how the stock saw volume zoom 143% above its 50-day average on the May 5 breakout day. At the time, volume traded on average 678,000 shares each day.Baozun's expertise lies in helping multinational brands such as Nike (NKE) succeed in their marketing campaigns in China. In 2016, earnings jumped 154% to 33 cents a share on a 23% jump in sales to $504 million.IBD's TAKE: Baozun was featured earlier this year in The New America. The New America index, as seen in the Market Indexes table on page B6 of the latest IBD Weekly print edition, is up 26% since Jan. 1, pummeling the major indexes. See what other companies have qualified for this proprietary IBD screen for hot growth companies.Celgene (CELG), Abiomed (ABMD) and Bioverativ (BIVV) are also acting well. Abiomed, a heart pump innovator, is close to breaking out of a narrow flat-base pattern at 147.55. Eight stocks in the IBD 50 are tied to the medical sector.Abiomed, up nearly 2% to 147, is expected to grow full-year earnings per share by 48% to $1.84 in FY 2018 (ending in March next year) and 41% in FY 2019.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures rose 1.2% to $46.33 a barrel as the U.S. dollar has shown weakness in recent weeks. The dollar is currently worth 111.13 yen but appeared to be testing buying support near 110, a level last seen in mid-June.

The stock continues to perform well since an April 24 breakout past a 126.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, is holding above a 127.74 cup-without-handle entry. The specialist in blood cancers and other difficult diseases fell less than 0.5% to 134.38, up around 5.2% from that precise buy point. Savvy investors do not chase a stock once it's already moved more than 5% past the proper breakout point. However, a normal-looking pullback to within the proper buy zone gives an investor a second chance to scoop shares.Celgene is expected to grow second-quarter earnings 24% to $1.78 a share. In the prior eight quarters, earnings rose 37%, 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% vs. year-ago levels.Q2 revenue is seen increasing 18% to $3.24 billion, following top-line gains of 21%, 28%, 16% and 18% in the prior four periods.Apple (AAPL) continues to reflect steady institutional support, wiping away early losses to rise slightly to 149.75.As noted in a recent Stock Market Today column, a pronounced move back above the 50-day moving average would boost the prospects of a fresh breakout.Apple is showing a limited decline after its recent all-time peak of 156.65, falling no more than 9%. That's the sort of correction usually seen in a flat base pattern. Both current and prospective shareholders can watch to see if the stock can take out that high and rise at least 10 cents more, signaling a new breakout.One concern is the strength of continued sponsorship by mutual funds and hedge funds. According to data from William O'Neil + Co., 511 funds built new positions and 1,421 funds added to their stakes in the second quarter of this year, but 2,130 funds trimmed or completely sold their positions.RELATED:3 Sectors Gain As Netflix Lifts Nasdaq; Goldman Hurts Dow Top-Performing Stocks Today: Inside IBD's Stock SpotlightWill Apple Furnish A New Buy Point?Investor's Corner: What Is The Easy Method To Spot Major Market Tops?

For now, Merck continues to be in base-building mode.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies continued to cool off. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave back most of Friday's rebound, losing 10% to 1,763. However, the overall picture of the fast-rising exchange-traded note has not changed. It's been in a normal correction since peaking at 3,523 on Dec. 19, and Tuesday marks the start of a fifth week of digesting the superlative gains seen in the fourth quarter of last year.On Nov. 22, Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 and roared more than 257% higher in less than a month.

WTI near-term futures edged 0.7% lower to $63.88 a barrel.Market breadth turned negative in U.S. equities, with losing stocks outmatching winners by nearly 2-to-1 on both exchanges.A few leading stocks let their strong gains slip. Weibo (WB) moved past a 122.31 buy point in a seven-week cup with handle and rallied to as high as 128.37, up 4.9% past the proper entry. But the stock backtracked to cut its gain to roughly 1%.The decline within Weibo's cup base runs from 123 on the left-side peak to 97.49, a correction of 20.7%.

At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude oil slumped more than 4% to $45.79 a barrel. Commodities also slumped on concerns of slowing demand from China.Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Caterpillar (CAT) took hits in the Dow with losses of around 1% to 2%.In the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) slumped nearly 5% as it looks poised to test a prior 287.49 buy point.

231,ABMD,"Stocks got off to a weak start for the week on Monday, hurt by a big sell-off in the oil patch. Yet volume is running lower on both exchanges, a sign that large portfolio managers are not rushing for the exits.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continues to flex newfound strength, adding 0.8% to 130.09 and is poised to make an all-time closing high. Shares are now up more than 10% since clearing a new cup-with-handle base at 118.12 on Jan. 6 and 9.A continued rally could boost the gain from Apple's prior entry at 110.33 to nearly 20%. A solid portfolio management rule for growth investing is to take at least some profits when a stock's rally reaches 20% to 25%. Selling on the way up locks in gains ahead of a potential extended pullback and raises cash that can be deployed in future breakouts.Apple's recent breakouts are from early-stage bases, another positive, as the mega-cap tech play completed a bottoming base after a yearlong decline.The Nasdaq composite was off just 0.2%, doing better than the S&P 500 (down 0.3%), the NYSE composite (down nearly 0.5%) and the Russell 2000 (off almost 0.9%). The Nasdaq 100 was nearly flat, indicating that the big money continues to flow into large-cap tech stocks.Oil drilling, international exploration and machinery shares led the slide, as did meat product, department store and integrated telecom stocks.Nvidia (NVDA), meanwhile, outperformed most issues with a 2% gain to 116.71. The surprising advance leaves the stock just a few points below its all-time high of 119.93. A six-week cup base has also formed, yielding a 120.03 entry for now. Keep in mind that the gains in Nvidia, a leader in technology for autonomous vehicles, video games, data centers and AI, may be limited for now because the stock made such an outsized advance in 2016.A mid-March breakout past a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point produced a marvelous 261% gain, but in the end of December, Nvidia also showed signs of a climax top.Given that the firm reports fiscal Q4 results on Thursday, the current action may reflect a bit of ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news"" mentality on Wall Street.That said, analysts on consensus see earnings rising a decent 12% to $2.71 a share in FY 2018, slowing down from a 44% lift expected for the fiscal year that just ended in January, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.'s next-generation database Panaray. Revenue is seen rising 16% to $7.9 billion in FY 2018 (ending in January next year), down from a 44% bulge in FY 2017.Also in the stock market today, Abiomed (ABMD) rallied 4% to 109.49 in fast turnover. Watch to see if the former leader and maker of heart pumps can climb back above its downward sloping 50-day moving average.Chinese internet Sina (SINA), another former leader, gained more than 2% to 71.52 in light turnover and is trying build a new base.

232,ABMD,"Stocks bled again on Thursday, and losses were weighted more heavily in technology and certain medical sectors.Meanwhile, long-term government bond prices rose on both sides of the pond, sending the yield on the U.S. 10-year bond to around 1.8%. The 10-year U.K. bond yield edged back below 1.20% to around 1.18%, according to Tradeweb, after British judges ruled that only the U.K. Parliament can formally begin the process of the country's exit from the EU.Commodities fell, led by a 1.2% slide in West Texas intermediate crude oil futures to $44.78 a barrel. Gold edged 0.4% lower on the Comex, while silver slid 1.9%.The Nasdaq 100 fell 1%, a touch worse than the 0.9% drop by the Nasdaq composite.Apple (AAPL) fell slightly more than 1% to 109.83, dipping back below its 110.33 cup-with-handle breakout point for the first time since its Sept. 14 breakout in towering volume. That's a sell signal. Watch to see if the stock can hold close to that proper entry and begin a fresh rebound.With the market still in a pressured uptrend and distribution still heavy recently on both key indexes, it's not a surprise that other growth stocks have joined Apple in stumbling back near or below their prime entry points, especially in the field of medical devices.Abiomed (ABMD), down 1.6% to 102.51, has fallen nearly 30% in just four weeks. The heart pump innovator is back below a 105.05 cup-with-handle entry.Also in the medical sector, artificial joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) edged 0.5% higher to 102.54, but only after having fallen more than 20% below its 52-week high; it's now hovering near 102, roughly 3% below a 105.58 entry in a long bottoming base. Zimmer earlier this week plummeted 14% after reporting a 9% rise in Q3 earnings to $1.79 a share. That marked the second quarter in a row of decelerating profit growth.Sales rose just 4% after the Warsaw, Ind., firm notched gains of 59%, 58%, 68% and 66% in the prior four quarters, thanks to a merger with Biomet that completed in June 2015.The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% as generic drug, medical services, drug wholesale, biotech and gaming stocks paced the decline. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.2%. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is another market leader that has recently drifted back to prior buy point. In the regular session, the stock gained 1.8% to 43.37, returning back above a recent flat-base buy point at 43.25. The stock is also trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average.Wall Street saw the video game creator's quarterly profit doubling to 42 cents a share on a 51% pickup in revenue to $1.57 billion. After the close, Activision met that consensus estimate and exceeded its prior outlook of $1.49 billion, while non-GAAP earnings vaulted to 49 cents, crushing Wall Street's view by nearly 17%.The company reported 482 million monthly active users who logged more than 10 billion hours of play during the three-month period. CEO Bobby Kotick noted in a news release that its newest futuristic battle game franchise, ""Overwatch,"" has ""incredible player engagement"" and has topped 20 million players in four months.Activision also forecast Q4 net revenue at $1.86 billion, up 38% vs.  year ago. The stock initially fell nearly 3% in extended-hours trading but later rebounded to nearly break-even.Elsewhere in the stock market today, solar firms got trampled after former huge market winner First Solar (FSLR) reported a 46% plunge in third-quarter sales to $688 million, its worst year-over-year decline in more than three years.Earnings beat Wall Street views, yet still dropped 64% to $1.22 a share. The stock tanked 15% to 34.51, notching the lowest level since April 2013.Starbucks (SBUX), down 2% to 51.77, gained more than 1% after hours following news that the coffeehouse chain posted a 16% rise in non-GAAP earnings to 56 cents a share, including 6 cents stemming from an extra week of operation in the September-ended fourth quarter. Revenue grew 16% to $5.7 billion, and the company opened 690 net new stores, raising the total to 25,085 in 75 countries.The stock has been struggling since gapping lower on April 22 and losing support at both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.

233,ABMD,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) on Monday plunged 14% Monday to a seven-month low after the medical supplier lowered its full-year forecast on a weak third-quarter earnings report.The Warsaw, Ind.-based maker of orthopedic devices said it now sees diluted earnings at $1.50 to $1.60 a share, down from its previous forecast of $1.50 to $1.75. Adjusted earnings estimates were cut to a range of $7.90 to $7.95 a share, bringing down the upper end of that spread from $8.Shares ended the day tumbling by 17.15 to 105.40. Zimmer's violent stock reaction parallels that of other medical suppliers who have reported in recent days. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) plunged more than 17% on Wednesday after its earnings disappointed, while Abiomed (ABMD) stumbled by more than 15% over two days last week.Boston Scientific (BSX) slipped a few points when it reported earnings, but Stryker (SYK) saw a healthy uptick after it reported, gaining more than 4%.Zimmer expects its revenue growth to be down as well.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield hit 1.79%, near its mid-October high of 1.80%.Some leading stocks in the medical and consumer sectors got hammered following their quarterly results, including heart pump device firm Abiomed (ABMD) and auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).Abiomed made its third straight decline in heavy trading, gapping down 7% to 103.32. Shares fell as much as 15% intraday. It finished just a tad below its 200-day moving average, two days after slicing its 50-day moving average. Volume on Thursday shot nearly 10 times its average level.Abiomed reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of 20 cents a share, up 18% but well below the Street's consensus view, as profit margins declined year over year. Revenue grew 35% to $103 million.O'Reilly tanked nearly 9% to 253 in massive volume and dived below its long-term 200-day moving average. The chain reported Q3 earnings of 2.90 a share, up 15% but slightly below Wall Street's consensus view. It also marked a second quarter in a row of slowing EPS growth. Sales rose 7%, matching its Q2 increase.In July, O'Reilly broke out and cleared a 281.75 handle entry point, but gained less than 4% before backtracking. Since then, the stock's Relative Strength Rating has also faded to a 58 out of a maximum 99 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Meanwhile, a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D+ indicates net selling by institutional investors.After the close, internet giants Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) both reported robust Q3 results but were volatile in after-hours trading. The former was up roughly 1% while the latter sank more than 6%. Both megacap techs finished the regular session with piecemeal losses.In after-hours trading, Amazon shares dropped to as low as 779, significantly below its 50-day moving average near 799.

If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new base and breakout. Also keep in mind that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksOne weak spot is the company's 76 EPS Rating, which tracks quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth. Look for that to improve to 80 or better to show it's in the top 20% of all stocks. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks.

237,ABMD,"It's always a balancing act determining exposure to stocks when markets turn. Plunge in too quickly with your swing trades and you risk outsized losses on failed rally attempts. Act tentatively and you don't fully participate in the rallies that work. It's been top of mind in this latest recovery attempt.X The Nasdaq composite started the year with an 8.7% rise at its peak in January (1). What was most unusual about the strength is that it followed what was already a stellar 2017. In SwingTrader, profit taking on the way up naturally led to lower exposure for the downturn. Most setups looked extended at the top. As a result, removed stocks didn't have new names replacing them.When the Nasdaq dropped 3.8% on Feb. 5 (2), we already had been out of the market for two trading days. While it was a great position to be in, it's only one side of the equation. The next challenge is when do you get back in? Especially since a dramatic drop can lead to quick powerful moves on the bounce.However, we also had recent history of how these vertical violations of the 50-day moving average tend to recover. Nasdaq charts worthy of study include May 2010, August 2011, August 2015 and January 2016. These all had similar slices through their 50-day moving averages. Their recovery to new high ground took months not days, with some short rallies that quickly failed or led to choppy action. Contrast that with October 2014's 10% correction in the Nasdaq. The difference there was the initial drop was more gradual and less vertical.Using precedents in analysis is helpful but when it comes down to it, you must not get so wrapped up in the precedent that you ignore what the current market is actually doing.A reversal attempt in the market on Feb. 6 (3) looked promising so we attempted a test trade with Lululemon (LULU) the next day. We exited a day later as the market undercut the reversal day. You'll notice in the precedents noted above, a failure on the first one or two rally attempts is common.So far, this market's second reversal attempt (4) is holding and we booked profits on two stocks, Abiomed (ABMD) and Nvidia, (NVDA) and have solid gains on a third stock, Fibria Celulose (FBR). More exposure occurred due to things working in our favor but we didn't get overly aggressive. The high failure rate of initial rallies is still at the forefront of our minds. That caution served us well as this past week saw indexes hitting resistance multiple times starting on Feb. 16 (5). The Nasdaq bumped its head up against 7300 and turned tail four consecutive days while the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 saw their rise slowed at the 50-day moving average lines.Where do we go from here? Continued sideways action won't encourage new buys but may be a good thing in the end. It fosters more setups in stocks. We finally saw a solid close in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday, a promising show of strength. If accompanied by sound patterns in individual stocks, more swing trades will follow.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Stay For The Stock Gains, Avoid Corrections With Swing TradesAligning The Stars To Increase Profit Potential In Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

238,ABMD,"You've decided to buy that hot exchange traded fund and can't wait for the market to open so you can place your order.X But read this first before you rush to put in your order. Many pundits will tell you it's best to avoid trading right when the market opens.Stocks can be highly volatile right out of the gate — they can gap up or down sharply on early news or the prior day's earnings report, distorting the prices. Since an ETF is a basket of stocks, it's often better to give the underlying components a chance to settle.""There is a general rule that says not to trade during the first or last 15 minutes of the day, in large part because of the higher volatility a stock can experience during these times,"" Bruce Bond, founder & CEO of Innovator Capital Management, told IBD. ""This isn't an issue unique to ETFs. Since an ETF's value is derived from its underlying constituents, waiting for all constituents to open and their volatility to subside will create a better environment to buy or sell the ETF.""Likewise, you don't want to wait until right before the market closes, either. Big orders from institutional investors can cause temporary price distortions in both the underlying securities and the ETFs themselves, says Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com. So when is the ideal time?""Middle of the day is generally best, and if there are international (European) securities in the ETF, trading in the morning will ensure you get prices closest to fair value,"" Nadig explains.Now that you know what time of day is best, let's look at what kind of order you're planning on. Market or limit?If you want to execute the trade as quickly as possible, a market order is likely your better bet. However, if time isn't of the essence, industry experts say a limit order is almost always the best way to go.""For most investors, quality of price received is more important than speed of execution,"" Bond said. ""Using a market order will ensure you are executed very quickly, but you may not get the best price available. Using a limit order allows you to set a price at which you are willing to buy or sell.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 lets you track the market's leading growth stocks based on earnings, sales, price performance and other proprietary metrics. Check out the list now.Nadig takes an even harder line. He thinks limit orders should essentially be mandatory for ETF investors.""The only reason to place a market order — ever — is when you value speed of execution over price. Most investors aren't concerned with instantaneous fills, so putting a limit order in can minimize the chances of surprise,"" he said. ""Even if you put in a marketable limit — say an offer to buy an ETF at 24 when it's on screen for 23.50, you ensure that if the market suddenly ramps, you don't end up paying MORE than the 24. Your marketable-limit won't mean you overpay if the fair price is 23.50, it will just mean you don't get run up if something happens.""Innovator, which partnered with IBD on the Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) and Innovator IBD ETF Leaders (LDRS), has seen heavy early volume across nearly every ETF that trades regularly each day.FFTY, which launched in April 2015, has attracted more than $375 million in assets.

A solid rebound off the line could mark a new buy opportunity.Bond cites IBD 50 outperformance vs. the broader market and increased awareness of FFTY among reasons for recent increased interest in the ETF.""Investors also find value in the high-conviction nature of FFTY,"" he said. ""Unlike many ETFs or mutual funds that provide broad market exposure and rebalance on a quarterly basis, FFTY screens all U.S. listed securities, selecting only the top 50 stocks while rebalancing each week.""Abiomed (ABMD), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA) were among its top holdings as of Feb. 16.LDRS has gathered $60.2 million since its Dec. 21 launch.

271,ABMD,"A new high is fine, if an individual investor already has a position in the stock. For others, the new high is actionable only if the stock is clearing a valid base.If the stock is flirting with a new high but not quite able to break out, this too could be useful.Another possibility is a new high with no volume or a new high that reverses lower. These are cases where the new high can communicate trouble.Tuesday's market had a bit of everything.RV maker Thor Industries (THO) gapped up to a new high in torrid volume, but the stock is too extended to buy at this point.

275,ABMD,"Three medical device companies with Composite Ratings in the top 10% of all stocks were building on recent gains with strong quarters Thursday morning.Cardiac device giant Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high in early trading Thursday after its Q2 sales growth and guidance beat expectations, making up for weaker-than-expected margins.Boston Scientific's sales grew 15% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.12 billion, its strongest growth in nearly a decade and more than $50 million above analysts' consensus. It also added some $150 million to its full-year sales guidance, implying an 11% increase over last year.""Boston Scientific outperformed across the board, beating revenue estimates in all of its businesses and driving organic sales growth acceleration in all businesses and all geographies except Cardiology and emerging markets, where 2Q16 organic sales growth was stable vs. 1Q16,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She noted that gross margins were weaker than expected, which was why EPS of 27 cents a share was merely in line with views despite the top-line beat. The company did add a penny to its full-year EPS guidance, however, which she sees as a promise of margin expansion.Boston Scientific stock, holding an excellent Composite Rating of 97, hit 24.79 in early trading on the stock market today, its highest point since February 2006. At the close Thursday, shares were up 2.9% to 24.34.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific's strong financial and stock performance has put it at No. 8 on IBD's Big Cap 20, a list of growth stocks too big for the volatility associated with smaller growth stocks.Another medical device stock, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), hit an all-time high Thursday after it also topped expectations and raised guidance. Gross margins missed expectations also, but the company has managed to trim its tax bill and says that foreign-exchange headwinds will be softer than initially feared, which along with strong sales growth drove a hike in its full-year earnings guidance.Zimmer's sales have grown upward of 50% in the last four quarters thanks to acquisitions, but on a pro forma basis its guidance implies 3% to 3.5% growth this year.Zimmer stock peaked at 129.58 in early trading Thursday, and ended the day up 3.9% to 127.47. Its Composite Rating is 96.Finally, heart-pump maker Abiomed (ABMD) also reported a strong quarter, which marked a return to profit growth after two negative quarters.Abiomed stock nonetheless dipped, which analyst Antalffy warned might be the case in a note before the market opened.""This quarterly performance should drive share outperformance today from a fundamental perspective, but we would note that investor expectations going into these results were high, which could mitigate some of the potential outperformance,"" she wrote.Abiomed shares finished the day down 0.8% to 115.03. With a Composite Rating of 94, the stock hit an all-time high of 119.90 last week.

277,ABMD,"The stock market turned mixed Friday as Wall Street weighed another strong earnings report from Amazon.com (AMZN) but worried about a weaker-than-expected preliminary reading on Q2 gross domestic product.Leaderboard name Amazon added 1.5%. Late Wednesday, the company smashed earnings estimates and reported its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The Dow Jones industrial average gave back less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite added 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Thursday's levels in the stock market today.In the other global markets, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 bumped up 0.5% after the Bank of Japan voted for a mild increase in its monetary stimulus measures.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were early laggards in the Dow as both reported weak Q2 results and West Texas Intermediate crude oil dipped below $41 a barrel. Exxon Mobil lost 2.3% while Chevron recovered to trade flat. Merck (MRK) erased most of an early gain while Microsoft (MSFT) climbed 0.7%.In economic news, a preliminary read on Q2 gross domestic product showed growth of 1.2%, well below the consensus estimate of 2.6%. Gold was mostly unchanged ahead of the GDP data but picked up steam afterwards, rising 0.7% to $1,341.50 an ounce. The 10-year Treasury yield picked up 1 basis points to 1.51%.Medical-device maker Abiomed (ABMD) added 2%. Shares have been in a nice accumulation phase as the stock sits just 1% off an all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: Abiomed is one of several leaders in the strong-performing Medical-Products group. See who the other Leaders are with IBD Stock Checkup.IBD 50 name B&G Foods (BGS) soared nearly 13% after reporting strong earnings late Thursday. Quarterly profit jumped 68% from a year earlier. Sales jumped 58% to $306.4 million. Results were helped by its acquisition last year of the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands from General Mills (GIS).

278,ABMD,"Cardiac device maker Abiomed (ABMD) beat quarterly estimates and guided the current fiscal year above consensus Tuesday, but its elevated stock still slipped in trading.For its fiscal Q4 ended March 31, Abiomed's sales totaled $94 million, up 39% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by about $3 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings fell 14% to 24 cents a share but still beat consensus by 9 cents.The earnings decline in both Q3 and Q4 were due to tough year-over-year comparisons, but analysts expect growth to return in the current quarter and accelerate thereafter. Abiomed supported this with its guidance for the current fiscal year: $430 million to $445 million in sales vs. last year's $329.5 million, beating consensus of $421 million. It does not provide EPS guidance but said operating margin should be 18% to 20%, which would be flat to slightly below last year's.The margin guidance might have been a bit below expectations. Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy had estimated it at 20%, and Thomson Reuters' consensus for net income was also about 20% of revenue. Abiomed stock was down 2% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 97. The stock had been trading strong lately, with a consistent IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 90s. Shares are up more than 40% since touching a nine-month low in early February.Antalffy still was positive on Abiomed's report, noting good adoption trends for the company's Impella heart pump in the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) market.""We believe this adoption momentum is under-appreciated by the Street -- particularly given what we view as a possibly open-ended market opportunity in protected PCI as previously untreated patients are now increasingly treated -- paving the way for consistent ""beat and raise"" quarters over the near-to-medium term,"" Antalffy wrote in her research note.

281,ABMD,"Stocks are hard to predict. The best an investor can do is look for factors that improve the probability of success. IBD's SmartSelect Ratings in the stock tables and Stock Checkup on Investors.com are two places to start an evaluation.The ratings alone won't guarantee success. For example, a new factor — new products, new services or a change in industry conditions — is a key element for a winning stock. Yet there is no numerical way to judge a new factor.So give up the notion that ratings alone can identify a sure winner in every market. Investing is seldom that simple.Let's look at some of the best performing stocks of 2015. IBD ran a list of the top 50 gainers in the Jan. 4 Year-End Special.For our purposes here, we've weeded out companies that had never turned an annual profit or were thinly traded.Even among 2015's better stocks, the ratings were often imperfect. Given that 2015 was a mixed year for stocks, that's not a surprise.Many big gainers were turnaround stories, which naturally have spotty ratings.Abiomed (ABMD), a cardiac device maker, gained about 120% after bouncing off its 10-week line in January 2015. The day before the breakout, its ratings were: Composite Rating, 88; EPS, 51; RS, 97; Sales + Margins + ROE, C; Accumulation/Distribution, B.The low EPS and SMR ratings were tied to rocky results from mid-2013 to mid-2014. (The EPS Rating is calculated over five years and SMR over three quarters.)Netflix (NFLX) broke out in April and gained 70%. Its ratings were: Composite, 67; EPS, 46; RS, 86; SMR, B; Accumulation, C+. Netflix's earnings suffered from tough comparisons vs. the year-earlier quarters.Amazon.com (AMZN) was a turnaround story. Its stock broke out several times in 2015; at each breakout, ratings rose. By the July breakout, its Composite was 72, up from 26 at the start of the year. Other ratings in July were 18 EPS; 93 RS; D in SMR; B in Accumulation.Other top performers were Universal Display (OLED), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), NetEase (NTES), OrbitalATK (OA) and Acuity Brands (AYI).None were classic CAN SLIM stocks with highly strong ratings.The lesson: Don't expect 90-plus ratings in turnaround stocks that are fighting a difficult market.Adjust expectations to the market's condition and to the kind of stock (CAN SLIM, turnaround, cyclical) that you're studying.

Volume was running lower on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Nike (NKE) continued to help boost buying in the athleisure space following its better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results that included a 17% jump in future orders adjusted for currency swings, much higher than analysts expected.

Inogen (INGN), another medical products stock in the Spotlight screen, also has a 99 rating but is well out of buying range.ICU, based in San Clemente, Calif., popped 18% on Aug. 11 after reporting that Q2 profit soared 90% to 97 cents a share, easily beating Wall Street forecasts. However, the result was flattered by a weak comparison to the same period a year earlier, when earnings slipped 12%.Sales for the period rose 6%, continuing a trend of weak gains interspersed with slight declines.UCI is somewhat thin with daily dollar volume of $18 million. But demand for shares is positive and the well-regarded Fidelity Contrafund initiated a position last quarter.Fidelity Southern is close to completing a cup base.

"
328,ABMD,"Bauerlein, then only a sophomore at the University of California at Santa Barbara, mulled over the problem with a few classmates.

330,ABMD,"Nine-Hour Supply
"
331,ABMD,"The company went on to develop portable oxygen concentrators (POCs), which use a chemical process to separate oxygen from nitrogen in the surrounding air — meaning that users do not have to rely on a finite supply in a tank. While a traditional oxygen cylinder doesn't last long (a normal-size tank provides air for two to three hours, said Bauerlein), Inogen's current models can last up to nine hours with a double battery, which can be recharged by when plugged into a typical outlet.

"
337,ABMD,"Inogen shares broke out of a flat base with a 45.85 buy point on Aug. 12, a day after the company beat analyst Q2 forecasts with a 55% earnings leap to 17 cents a share and a 45% revenue jump to $44 million.

343,ABMD,"European Sales Grow Too
"
344,ABMD,"In its Q2 report, Inogen said its domestic business-to-business sales climbed 80.5% from 2014, driven by ""growing reseller and private label demand"" for POCs, while international B2B sales rose 71.7% on European strength. The company increased its sales staff late last year and in the first half of this year, prompting direct-to-consumer sales to grow 35% from 2014.

The stock is climbing the right side of a cup-type base with a potential buy point at 77. However, it could still add a handle to the pattern, which would yield a lower buy point.Abiomed is among the leaders in the 115-stock medical products industry, which was ranked No. 37 out of 197 as of Friday's IBD.Abiomed boasts a Composite Rating of 98, indicating it's in the top 2% of all stocks based on metrics such as earnings growth and relative price strength. Its Earnings Per Share Rating is a best-possible 99, reflecting three straight quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. Meanwhile, sales growth has been on the upswing amid rising demand for the company's flagship Impella line of heart pumps.For the fiscal first quarter that ended in June, analysts are expecting Abiomed to report a profit of 8 cents a share, up from a loss of 4 cents in the same quarter last year. Sales are forecast to rise 36% to $66.27 million, improving from the prior quarter's 34% gain and the biggest increase in 12 quarters. Results are due Aug. 4 before the market opens.On June 29, the Justice Department said it ended an investigation into marketing practices for its Impella 2.5 pump without taking any enforcement action.""An adverse decision would have marred the company's top line to a considerable extent,"" Zacks Equity Research said July 2.It added, however, that intensifying competition and currency risk due to the company's ""significant international presence"" could hurt future revenue growth.Abiomed has enjoyed four quarters of rising fund ownership. The Primecap Odyssey Growth Fund , rated A+, has had a stake in the company going back to at least 2008.Profit in the fiscal year ending next March is expected to slip 5% to 60 cents a share, then jump 45% in fiscal 2016.

362,ABMD,"The L in IBD's CAN SLIM stock investment system is a simple yet vital concept.
"
363,ABMD,"It stands for Leaders: high-growth stocks with the greatest potential for outstanding returns.
"
364,ABMD,"True market leaders are typically the best performers in top-tier industry groups or sectors. They boast strong profit and revenue growth, generate unique or innovative products and services, and receive solid institutional support.
"
365,ABMD,"""The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir,"" wrote IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""
"
366,ABMD,"Some investing systems emphasize buying stocks that have been beaten down, implying that they're undervalued and therefore ready to rebound. But CAN SLIM investors focus on stocks that are showing strength as they break out of properly formed bases and hit new highs.
"
367,ABMD,"If the overall stock market is trending higher , and you buy at a proper buy point, you have a strong chance of making money quickly with the top stocks. Volume as the stock breaks out of its base is key, as heavy volume indicates that the stock is being driven higher by mutual funds and other high-powered investors.
"
368,ABMD,"Top growth stocks that seemingly came out of nowhere to break out and rack up huge gains for investors include computer networking king Cisco Systems (CSCO) in October 1990, Apple (AAPL) in March 2004 and search engine pioneer Google (GOOGL) in September 2004. The table that accompanies this story shows a sample of today's leading stocks. They include drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV), shoemaker Nike (NKE) and medical device maker Abiomed (ABMD).
"
369,ABMD,"Leading stocks come from the top 40 of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks (see page B2 for a partial list). An industry group may have more than one leader, but investors should restrict their watch lists to no more than the top two or three.
"
370,ABMD,"Leaders should have quarterly earnings and sales growth of 25%, 50% or more. Annual profits should be similar. They should also have robust financial profiles that include solid margins, profit estimates and long-term growth.
"
371,ABMD,"A leading stock tends to hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of at least 80 out of 99, indicating that the stock's price performance ranks it in the top 15% off all stocks over the past 52 weeks. Stocks whose shares are falling usually indicate that their fundamentals are deteriorating. The top mutual fund managers may in fact be exiting out of the stock.

373,ABMD,"Investing in growth stocks, no matter how good their fundamentals or chart patterns, always comes with risks. For example, when a market correction hits, leading stocks can fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more than the general market.
"
374,ABMD,"Also, after lengthy uptrends, some leaders maintain high ratings from IBD even though they're in late-stage price runs. Prefer leaders when they're breaking out of early-stage bases over those breaking out after huge price runs.The L in IBD's CAN SLIM stock investment system is a simple yet vital concept.It stands for Leaders: high-growth stocks with the greatest potential for outstanding returns.True market leaders are typically the best performers in top-tier industry groups or sectors. They boast strong profit and revenue growth, generate unique or innovative products and services, and receive solid institutional support.""The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir,"" wrote IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""Some investing systems emphasize buying stocks that have been beaten down, implying that they're undervalued and therefore ready to rebound. But CAN SLIM investors focus on stocks that are showing strength as they break out of properly formed bases and hit new highs.If the overall stock market is trending higher , and you buy at a proper buy point, you have a strong chance of making money quickly with the top stocks. Volume as the stock breaks out of its base is key, as heavy volume indicates that the stock is being driven higher by mutual funds and other high-powered investors.Top growth stocks that seemingly came out of nowhere to break out and rack up huge gains for investors include computer networking king Cisco Systems (CSCO) in October 1990, Apple (AAPL) in March 2004 and search engine pioneer Google (GOOGL) in September 2004. The table that accompanies this story shows a sample of today's leading stocks. They include drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV), shoemaker Nike (NKE) and medical device maker Abiomed (ABMD).Leading stocks come from the top 40 of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks (see page B2 for a partial list). An industry group may have more than one leader, but investors should restrict their watch lists to no more than the top two or three.Leaders should have quarterly earnings and sales growth of 25%, 50% or more. Annual profits should be similar. They should also have robust financial profiles that include solid margins, profit estimates and long-term growth.A leading stock tends to hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of at least 80 out of 99, indicating that the stock's price performance ranks it in the top 15% off all stocks over the past 52 weeks. Stocks whose shares are falling usually indicate that their fundamentals are deteriorating. The top mutual fund managers may in fact be exiting out of the stock.An easy way to find the outstanding leaders is to check the Sector Leaders table, today on Page B1.Investing in growth stocks, no matter how good their fundamentals or chart patterns, always comes with risks. For example, when a market correction hits, leading stocks can fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more than the general market.Also, after lengthy uptrends, some leaders maintain high ratings from IBD even though they're in late-stage price runs.

376,ABMD,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Funeral Services and book stocks took the hardest hits.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter @IBD_PWhitfield.

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels.According to The Conference Board, confidence jumped to 104.1, nicely above the consensus estimate of 98.8.

436,ABMD,"U.S. stocks advanced confidently for solid gains Tuesday, closing near session highs.The Nasdaq rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher but that was on an easy comparison. Volume declined for three sessions in a row through Monday.Monday night's uneventful presidential debate gave the market little reason to react in fear or greed. Economic news Tuesday and at least one technical factor might have been the bigger influences on the day's action.The PMI Services Flash survey came in at 51.9, up from August's 50.9 reading. Meanwhile, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index trampled the Street's 98.8 consensus estimate with 104.1 for September, which was higher than any estimate in the range.A technical factor also may have improved the market's mood. The put-call ratio closed at 1.08 Monday, a level that sometimes hints at a short-term bottom. The last time the ratio was in that neighborhood was Sept. 9 and 13, with readings of 1.14 and 1.11. The Nasdaq formed a bottom and began to rise around that time.If the presidential candidates managed to get through Monday night's debate without disturbing the market, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer also kept trouble at arm's length.

On Aug. 26, Fischer upset the market a bit when he suggested two rate hikes this year would be ""consistent"" with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's remarks.IBD'S TAKE: A diverse mix of gainers Tuesday was a good sign for the stock market. But there's nothing wrong with long-time big leaders: Facebook is retaking a buy point, at least intraday.Individual stocks were finding different reasons to advance Tuesday, a good sign. Catalysts varied from divestitures, regulatory approval and a new price target to earnings and industry conditions.For example, Procter & Gamble (PG) popped about 0.6% in very heavy volume. The company is close to wrapping up a deal to transfer 41 brands to Coty (COTY). Procter & Gamble has been divesting weaker units for the past two years. Analysts say the Coty move completes P&G's divestiture program. The Street expects P&G to grow EPS 6% in fiscal 2017 ending in June and then 9% in fiscal 2018. The 9% growth would be the best in 10 years.Abiomed (ABMD) gained Japan's regulatory go-ahead for the Massachusetts company's heart pump device. The midcap stock thrust 2% in above-average volume to a 52-week high. The Street expects Abiomed to grow earnings 38% in fiscal 2017 ending in March and then 54% the following year.Amazon.com (AMZN) rode 2% to a new high after JPMorgan & Chase raised its price target from 925 to 1,000 and kept shares at an overweight rating.Thor Industries (THO) gapped up 3.5% on quarterly results and a strong rating for the group. Volume was running more than 500% above average.RV shipments industrywide have been running strong. The tally came in at 35,946 in August, which was the best August total since 1977. The August total represented a 31% year over year gain, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.Other RV stocks also are doing well. Drew Industries (DW) bounced off its 50-day moving average line Tuesday, as the stock gained more than  3% in slightly below-average volume. Patrick Industries (PATK) rumbled more than 4% higher as it retook its 50-day line.

"
448,ABMD,"Abiomed's earnings in fiscal Q4 ended March 31 totaled 28 cents a share excluding one-time items. That was up from just 9 cents in the year-earlier quarter and 14 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters.

"
450,ABMD,"The beat was especially notable, given that the launch of the firm's new Impella RP heart pump was dampened by snowstorms in the Northeast during the quarter, which canceled most of the training sessions required for physicians using the Impella for risky heart procedures. The growth also came ahead of the March 24 expanded FDA approval of Impella 2.5, which lets Abiomed market the device to physicians without any restrictions. CEO Mike Minogue said on the conference call with analysts Tuesday that such marketing efforts have swung into high gear, with a ""mobile learning lab"" in a double-wide trailer traveling the country as a sort of door-to-door expo booth.

The company's earnings rose 8% from the year-earlier quarter to 41 cents a share, topping the Street's consensus by 4 cents. Revenue was flat at $1.1 billion, in line with consensus. Like most other global players this quarter, the firm took a big hit from foreign-exchange rates; at constant currency, sales grew 6% and earnings 14%.
"
460,ABMD,"The FX headwinds, along with reduced business in Venezuela, led Zoetis to cut its full-year sales guidance by $1.25 billion, now $4.675 billion to $4.775 billion, while maintaining previous operating EPS guidance of $1.61 to $1.68.

461,ABMD,"Zoetis also announced a ""comprehensive operational efficiency initiative,"" which includes cutting various costs and unloading some 5,000 lower-margin products.

464,ABMD,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.Three very different but similarly high-rated medical stocks reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday morning, driving up stocks all around.The smallest but hottest was device maker Abiomed (ABMD), which jumped 15% to a new high near 75 in early trading after soundly beating Wall Street's expectations and raising its guidance. A bit later, Abiomed stock was up 11%, near 72.50.Abiomed's earnings in fiscal Q4 ended March 31 totaled 28 cents a share excluding one-time items. That was up from just 9 cents in the year-earlier quarter and 14 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 34% to $67.6 million, some $5 million above the Street's average estimate.For the full fiscal 2015, sales rose 25% to $230.3 million while profit jumped 250% to 63 cents a share. Abiomed added $25 million to its fiscal 2016 sales guidance, now $285 million to $295 million. It did not issue EPS guidance but said it expects an operating profit margin in the 12%-to-16% range.The beat was especially notable, given that the launch of the firm's new Impella RP heart pump was dampened by snowstorms in the Northeast during the quarter, which canceled most of the training sessions required for physicians using the Impella for risky heart procedures. The growth also came ahead of the March 24 expanded FDA approval of Impella 2.5, which lets Abiomed market the device to physicians without any restrictions. CEO Mike Minogue said on the conference call with analysts Tuesday that such marketing efforts have swung into high gear, with a ""mobile learning lab"" in a double-wide trailer traveling the country as a sort of door-to-door expo booth.CFO Robert Bowen said 2016 guidance does not include sales in Japan, where he expects Impella will launch late in the fiscal year. Bowen said the company will update guidance to include that later this year.Mallinckrodt Hikes GuidanceAbiomed's stock boasts the highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, as does Mallinckrodt (MNK), a specialty drug maker that also reported a good quarter early Tuesday. Its earnings jumped 82% to $1.72 a share, beating consensus by 21 cents. Revenue climbed 62% to $910 million.Mallinckrodt added 40 cents to its full-year EPS guidance range, now $6.70 to $7.20 vs. $5.02 last year. Its sales guidance is now $10 million higher than previously, at $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion vs. $2.54 billion last year.On the conference call with analysts, CEO Mark Trudeau admitted that certain nonrecurring benefits boosted generic-drug sales in the quarter, while growth of key immunology drug Acthar was an anemic 9%. However, he reiterated his belief in the long-term potential of the product, saying that only about 3% of the potential 300,000 patients he believes could benefit from its 19 approved indications are currently being treated.""With this untapped potential, we believe we could double the number of patients on Acthar in the longer term,"" he said.Mallinckrodt stock was up 4% to near 120 in early trading In the stock market today.Zoetis Cutting CostsAnimal-health giant Zoetis (ZTS) announced yet another quarterly beat and also a massive cost-cutting program. The company's earnings rose 8% from the year-earlier quarter to 41 cents a share, topping the Street's consensus by 4 cents. Revenue was flat at $1.1 billion, in line with consensus. Like most other global players this quarter, the firm took a big hit from foreign-exchange rates; at constant currency, sales grew 6% and earnings 14%.The FX headwinds, along with reduced business in Venezuela, led Zoetis to cut its full-year sales guidance by $1.25 billion, now $4.675 billion to $4.775 billion, while maintaining previous operating EPS guidance of $1.61 to $1.68.Zoetis also announced a ""comprehensive operational efficiency initiative,"" which includes cutting various costs and unloading some 5,000 lower-margin products. The firm said this will lower revenue but boost profit, although the latter effect won't be apparent until after this year. It offered 2017 EPS guidance of $2.18 to $2.32, well above the Street's current estimate of $2.12.""The much better longer-term margins (34% operating margin vs. consensus at 29%) are driven by additional cost-saving initiatives of $300 million by 2017,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients.

484,ABMD,"On Jun 11, we issued an updated research report on PetMedExpress, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include increased focus on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items while also expanding the product line.After several quarters of drag in new order sales, we are impressed with PetMed’s improved performance through fiscal 2018. The entire year demonstrated a bullish momentum with new order sales growth of 8%, primarily on aggressive advertising. Although the company witnessed 5% softness in New Order sales during the fourth quarter, it is strategically increasing advertisements to handle the situation tactfully.Further, reorder sales grew 10.3% in the year. In the final quarter, driven by a change in product mix to higher priced items and augmented doses, average order size rose to $89 from $86 a year ago.PetMed is also working on improving its campaigns’ effectiveness. The company has been quite successful in pushing up its sales via the Internet. Approximately, 85% of the company’s orders was generated on the website during the fourth quarter compared with 83% in the year-ago period. Of late, the company has started focusing on advertising abilities to better new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items including generics while expanding its product offerings. PetMed offers a wide range of products for dogs, cats and horses. We believe that with progress in economic conditions, PetMed's broad product portfolio will help drive growth in the coming quarters.However, with an aim to increase the recognition of its brand names, PetMed markets its products through national advertising campaigns. Under this procedure, the company has been incurring huge expenses related to advertising campaigns in the recent times. Hence, escalating advertising expenses exert pressure on the bottom line. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a major concern.Stock Performance Over the past three months, PetMed has underperformed its industry.

485,ABMD,"With a market capitalization of approximately $20.26 billion, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from consistent solid organic revenue growth, World Courier Business, H.D. Smith acquisition and deal with Walgreens. A temporary PharMEDium slowdown, declining dollar, generic inflation, cutthroat competition in the niche space and lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches are denting growth.For fiscal 2018, AmerisourceBergen expects revenue growth in the range of 8-11% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $167.94 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.7% year over year.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65 for fiscal 2018. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $6.46 per share, which falls within the guidance.However, the fiscal 2018 earnings estimates declined 0.3% in the last two months. Buoyed by the above mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteSo, here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing AmerisourceBergen, and also the brighter prospects that indicates of a near-term recovery.Factors Plaguing AmerisourceBergenAmerisourceBergen has recently received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about the testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis. Memphis is the company’s largest highly automated production facility.Consequently, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all products from there that had yet to expire. Recently, the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment over the long haul.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment's results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, with the company witnessing lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution. Per management, contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than anticipated due to the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures,.Why Should You Hold?Despite adversities in PharMEDium, AmerisourceBergen’s World Courier unit is likely to be the key driver of revenues. The unit is a global leader in specialty logistics that designs and executes world-class logistics processes.Per management, World Courier’s position as the leader in global specialty logistics services propelled volume growth and overall performance for the company in the last couple of quarters as well.Recently, the company announced the designation of its flagship World Courier unit as the first logistics company to obtain global Good Distribution Practices (GDP) certification against three major standards.The business posted impressive results in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. At the end of the quarter, World Courier’s company-owned offices were spread across more than 50 countries, with 14 investigational drug depots located in emerging markets worldwide. Solid volume growth and expanding operating margins have favored World Courier unit in the quarter.Price PerformanceAmerisourceBergen outperformed its industry in a month's time. The company’s shares have gained 10.3% compared with the industry's rise of 5.1%.

QuoteSegmental AnalysisThe company currently distributes its products through two subsidiaries — Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health.Dental SegmentThis segment provides a virtually complete range of consumable dental products, equipment, software, turnkey digital solutions and value-added services to dentists and laboratories throughout North America.In the fourth quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) declined 10.1% year over year to approximately $545.8 million. Changes in sales force, disruptions from enterprise resource planning implementation and the expansion of the company’s digital equipment portfolio hindered revenues in the segment.However, sales were up 0.4% on a constant-currency basis (cc).Dental ConsumableSales in the sub-segment were $318 million, down 6.3% year over year.

Sales were up 0.4% at cc.Other Services and ProductsThis segment comprises technical service, parts and labor, software support services as well as office supplies. Sales in the segment declined 2.2% on a year-over-year basis to $71.8 million. Sales were up 0.2% at cc.Animal Health SegmentThis segment is a leading distributor of products, services and technologies to the production along with companion animal health markets in North America and the U.K.Coming to the fourth-quarter performance of the platform (60.5% of total sales), sales increased almost 2.5% on a year-over-year basis to $848 million.Global companion animal sales inched up 1.9%. Production animal sales increased 2.8%, reflecting strong performance across swine and beef-cattle segment.Margin AnalysisGross profit in the reported quarter was $289.8 million, down 13.6% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 252 basis points (bps) to 20.7% in the quarter.Operating income in the fourth quarter was $41.3 million, down 57.1% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, operating margin contracted 420 bps in the quarter.GuidanceThe company expects adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 in the range of $1.73-$1.83 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.74 per share, which lies within guidance.Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $27.3 million or 30 cents per share.Our TakeLackluster sales and earnings performance dampened Patterson Companies’ fourth-quarter results. However, the company’s strong fiscal 2019 guidance buoys optimism. We are upbeat about the Animal Health segment that has been performing well lately.The company provides a wide range of consumable supplies, equipment, software and value-added services. A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe that a diversified product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts.On the flip side, operating margins have been dull.  Declining revenues in the dental segment is another headwind.

489,ABMD,"The Medical Instrument industry within the broader Medical universe has been gaining on R&D innovation, higher consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition. The industry increased 3.6% in a month’s time, higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 2%.Fundamentally, the industry has benefited by a massive change in consumer behavior as well. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests as well as use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.It will be interesting to analyze the best Medical Instrument stocks that are likely to yield solid returns in the days to come. But first, let us glance at the latest headlines from the space. Latest Medical Instrument Headlines at a Glance Stryker’s Takeover Plans of Boston ScientificThe Medical Instrument fraternity has been riding on the current merger and acquisition (M&A) trends.Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion. However, the possibility of the deal is uncertain. Thre are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew in 2015, which never materialized. On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. The company acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration (read more: Stryker Likely to Acquire Boston Scientific).Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will gain from rapidly-expanding customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention.Abiomed Reserves Slot in the S&P 500 Leading Medical Instrument player Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report) replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp and entered the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Per a research report by The Globe and Mail, Abiomed is following the trend of medical device and technology companies reserving the top slot in the S&P 500 index. To remind investors, Align Technology Inc (ALGN  -  Free Report) topped the index in 2017.Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. Medical Instrument industry (read more: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark).Tax Abolition Boosting R&DA bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. This tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax had a negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs.For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activities in this space. The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism. The ratification of the Tax-repeal amendment has invoked massive investment in the sector.3 Top Medical Instrument StocksConsidering the existence of the number of players in the Medical Instruments industry, choosing the right stocks with the potential to yield returns might be a daunting task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple for you.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings is currently pegged at $10.26, up 14.1% year over year.Growing adoption of the company’s da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, continuous innovation and solid recurring revenue base are the key catalysts.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that allows the surgeon’s hand movements to be translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient’s body.da Vinci has bolstered the company’s foothold in the markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery.

The Cardio & Vascular arm deserves a special mention here. The other segments have also been delivering a solid performance.The strategic divestment of the Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical wing to MedPlast, LLC is expected to prove profitable in the quarters ahead. The company has a multi-year plan for long-term developments. An impressive guidance, declining operating expenses and the clearing of debt are other major positives. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

493,ABMD,"Pacific Biosciences of California (PACB  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will feature new multiplexing sequencing tools at the upcoming American Society for Microbiology (“ASM”) annual meeting in Atlanta. This will make the process of obtaining microbial genomes highly accurate, faster and more affordable.Additionally, results of the genome sequencing of more than 3000 dangerous bacteria by Pacific Biosciences, housed at UK’s National Collection of Type Cultures, will also be showcased at the meeting.The upgraded Sequel System, also known as the PacBio Sequel System, has an increased throughput. It will enable multiple microbes to be sequenced on a single SMRT (Single Molecule, Real-Time) Sequencing Cell in a day, thereby reducing costs. Each microbe will have a unique barcode, which will be incorporated into SMRTbell adapters. This will help in multiplexing.PacBio Sequel System to Drive Top LinePacBio includes PacBio RS and PacBio RS II Systems. This is a nucleic acid sequencing platform, based on SMRT technology. It has been a significant contributor to the company’s top line, despite stiff competition from MedTech bigwigs like Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report).At the beginning of 2017, the company released its latest sequencing enzyme and software for the Sequel System.In fact, in the first quarter of 2018, Sequel bookings have been strong, with the largest number of instruments ordered since 2015. The largest multi-unit sequel order came from China, driven by planned animal sequencing projects.Moreover, AL-based HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology is currently using the PacBio Sequel to study more than 500 children and their parents.

494,ABMD,"With a market capitalization of approximately $10.17 billion, DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings in the trailing three quarters. However, the company faces margin threats and foreign exchange headwinds.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.6% against the industry’s rise of 4.3% in a month’s time.Let’s take a detailed look at the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold this stock for now.Probable HeadwindsDENSTPLY SIRONA expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous projection of $2.70-$2.80. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is currently pegged at $2.57 per share, significantly lower than management’s expectations.DENTSPLY SIRONA expects gross margins and operating margins to be flat to slightly down as underlying margin rate improvement in businesses is expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and the headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions. By the end of the first quarter of 2018, the company confirmed that it expects full-year 2018 operating margins to be down between 100 and 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis.DENTSPLY SIRONA has significant international foothold, particularly in Europe. Therefore, a strengthening U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies negatively impacts the company’s results. We believe that the currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018. The company also faces significant pricing pressure due to intensifying competition.What’s Favoring the Stock?DENTSPLY SIRONA's innovations have been consistently driving its top line. Per management, the company spends more than $150 million in R&D and thus has a robust pipeline. Furthermore, efforts of DENTSPLY SIRONA’s laser team in accelerating major innovations deserve a mention.The company’s commitment to clinical education is also praiseworthy.

496,ABMD,"Mechatronics, a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering, has been in vogue, of late. With growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic companies, organizations with significant exposure to Mechatronics have been raking in huge profits. A research by the Business Wire deciphers that the global Mechatronics and Robotics market is projected to witness a CAGR of 15.02% during the 2017-2021 period.Considering the strong exposure of Mechatronics in almost all spheres like technology, automobile, telecom and more, the evolution of Medical Mechatronics has been the most fascinating.The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of Information Technology (IT) for quick and improved patient care as well as a shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate the predominance of Mechatronics in the MedTech space.So, let’s delve into details on how Medical Mechatronics has been creating new opportunities in MedTech and raising investors’ confidence to put money in the healthcare space for long-term gains.How is Mechatronics Shaping Up the Healthcare Paradigm?Medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry.Medical Mechatronics has provided innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices, development of low cost disposable devices, portability of devices and error free results.Per Hindawi, a renowned Healthcare Engineering journal, the Medical Mechatronics revolution has been one of the most important drivers of the global knowledge-based economies like the United States.Here we take a look at the two major aspects of Medical Mechatronics that have been doing rounds in the global headlines.3D printing & Medical MechatronicsThe best example of Mechatronics in the healthcare industry is 3D printing, which has changed the face of the medical devices industry.Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Of the major companies, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has been one of the early adopters of the 3D printing technology. The company’s FDA-approved Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation.Robotics Boosting Medical Mechatronics The rise of Mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new robotic solutions to mitigate age-old problems for the MedTech companies. These solutions are pain less, error free and inexpensive. So MedTech companies that are using Mechatronic-based robots to cure diseases have a competitive edge with a strong customer base, solid revenues and handsome profits.Of the major companies, MedTech giant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) is a notable mention.Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This Mechatronic-based platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery.The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Let us take a look at three other MedTech stocks that have been hogging the limelight based on the growing prevalence of Mechatronics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector.3 Best MedTech Stocks Riding High on MechatronicsIn this backdrop, three MedTech stocks are well positioned on strong fundamentals and solid exposure to Mechatronics.We have used the Zacks Stock Screener to pick them.

498,ABMD,"Brightree, the wholly owned subsidiary of ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report), recently entered into a strategic partnership with athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report), a leading provider of network-enabled services for hospital and ambulatory clients.Brightree has released a new solution for home medical equipment (HME) providers to digitally receive orders from more than 62,000 providers using athenaClinicals within the athenahealth network.From Brightree’s point of view, this deal is like adding another feather in its cap for delivering cloud-based software to post-acute care companies, which look set to improve business performance and patient outcomes.Notably, Brightree’s information exchange platform, eReferral, enables HME organization to seamlessly exchange information and receive referrals from external referral sources and Hospice customers, who are also part of the Brightree community.Before eReferral management happened, physicians and HME staff had to manually send, receive and process referrals as well as related documents via faxing and phone calls. Currently, Brightree is working hard to connect more physicians with eReferral Management, thus maximizing cost and time savings for them as well as HMEs.With respect to Brightree-athenaHealth partnership, offices using athenaHealth can refer patients to the HME providers the same way they refer them to other care settings, by forwarding equipment orders directly from their electronic health records system to the HME providers’ referral workflow within the Brightree system.Per Brightree, this digitized process will largely reduce the time of the entire procedure on one hand. While on the other, it will improve information accuracy, expediting patient care.Brightree Prospects at a GlanceSignificantly, ResMed’s Brightree software-as-a-service business is gradually growing strong. This business has been part of the ResMed Group for two full years, having registered a stable period of success. On the last reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 conference call, ResMed noted that Brightree systems handled more than 8.2 billion digital requests over the last 12 months. Revenues for the third quarter increased 14% year over year to $39.9 million.Moreover, analyzing the HME market prospects, we expect this growth momentum to sustain in the long run. According to an article by Freedonia Group, US demand for home medical equipment in 2018 is likely to gain 8.2% to $12.6 billion, driven by technological advances and cost containment efforts.Share Price Performance  In the past three months, shares of ResMed have outperformed its industry. The stock has risen 8.2% compared with the 5.6% growth of the industry.Zacks Rank and Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It exited the first quarter of 2018 on a commendable note with better-than-expected earnings and revenue performances.The stock’s stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the CAG (Companion Animal Group) business. In the first quarter, CAG revenues rose 13% organically year over year, supported by CAG Diagnostics’ recurring organic revenue growth.Moreover, IDEXX VetLab consumables organic revenue growth was firm on the back of an expanding premium instrument base in the United States and the international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention.Notably, in January 2018, the company made Catalyst SDMA Test available in North America.

513,ABMD,"Cardinal Health Inc (CAH  -  Free Report) underperformed its industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have lost 28.6%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 6.4%. The current return is also lower than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 13.1%.Recently, Cardinal Health has been facing sluggishness in the exam-gloves unit. Further, cutthroat competition in the niche space is a headwind.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line declined9.2% in the last two months to $4.92. This shows a year-over-year decline of 8.9%. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom linedeclined 29.5% in the last two months to 93 cents. This indicates a fall of 29% on a year-over-year basis.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus  Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Here we take a peek at the major issues plaguing Cardinal Health.Issues in Medical-Gloves UnitCardinal Health offers a robust portfolio of medical gloves including surgical gloves, exam gloves and clean-room gloves. While the Medical segment has been performing well in the recent quarters, the company has been facing challenges in the exam-glove sub-segment.In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, commodity pricing and supply disruptions have dampened the section. For fiscal 2018, lower expectations for the Medical segment due to headwinds in the exam-gloves segment is concerning. However, the company’s sourcing and commercial teams are pursuing several projects to minimize the impact.Cordis Unit Lacks LusterCardinal Health took over Johnson and Johnson’s Cordis unit for $1.94 billion in 2015 to enhance its top-line performance. But, by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, things have not been very bright for Cardinal Health, especially in the Cordis unit.The Cordis performance not only reduced the company’s adjusted operating earnings, but created a higher-than-expected adjusted effective tax rate (19 cents). Of this, Cordis-related increased tax-rate was 13 cents.Taking this into consideration, Cardinal Health anticipates obstacles and challenges in fiscal 2019. Per management, despite prospects in the Patient Recovery in Red Oak and subsequent U.S. tax reform, the company will face significant headwinds including Cordis performance, customer repricing, the loss of PharMerica and continued generic deflation.Consequently, Cardinal Health is not expected to achieve the 6% margin rate in the second half of fiscal 2018.Cutthroat Competition in Niche SpaceCardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For example, the pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from McKesson and AmerisourceBergen as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor.Moreover, the medical device market is mature whencompared with Cardinal Health’s pharmaceutical business. We believe that growing competition will hurt Cardinal Health’s medical segment’s margins in the near term.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report), Genomic Health, Inc (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report).Abiomed has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 27%.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, gross margin was flat year over year, while operating margins contracted 280 basis points year over year.Furthermore, the industry Cerner operates in is highly regulated by the government. With rapid evolution of product standards and requirements, any change in government regulation may have an adverse impact on Cerner's products.Bottom LineUnhindered by the issues, analysts are optimistic about Cerner. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pinned at $1.34 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 6%.Thus, investors might want to hold on to the stock, courtesy of Cerner’s edge over peers. We also believe that strategic partnerships and a strong EHR platform will continue to drive overall growth for the company.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics Inc.

518,ABMD,"Boston Scientific Corporation's (BSX  -  Free Report) MedSurg business group (comprising three sub segments viz. Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation) has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters. We expect this upside to further find reflection in first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for release on Apr 25.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is expected to be.Key CatalystsMedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, primarily led by endoscopy.

With Endochoice being fully integrated now, the company is once again expected to deliver solid, organic and operational growth within this segment in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $420 million for endoscopy revenues indicates an 8.5% rise from the year-ago quarter.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Within Urology and Pelvic health too, we expect another quarter of strong growth. Notably, last quarter, the company’s single-use digital ureteroscope, LithoVue, helped drive double-digit growth in core stone franchise within this sub segment.

We believe, innovative product launches in both spinal-cord and deep-brain stimulation franchises will likely fuel growth within this segment. We are particularly hopeful about the newly-launched WaveWriter SCS System, the first and the only platform approved by the FDA to simultaneously provide a paresthesia-based, sub-perception therapy for patients suffering chronic pain. Also, the Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System to treat Parkinson's disease, launched last December, should prove accretive to the company’s Nuromodulation revenues in the first quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $160 million for neuromodulation revenues translates into a 12.7% gain from the year-ago tally.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

524,ABMD,"Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for its Impella CPheart pump with SmartAssist, featuring an optical sensor. This will broaden the portfolio of its flagship, Impella heart pumps. The company plans a controlled roll-out of the technologically-advanced heart pump at hospital sites, with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year.What is PMA?Per FDA, special medical devices with a ‘Class III’ tag require a PMA nod for the availability in the markets. Notably, these Class III devices have an extremely high level of risks associated with its usage. Consequently, general regulatory approvals, alone, can’t assure the safety and effectiveness of these devices.Abiomed’s Impella CP heart pump is a Class III medical device.The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included over 60 engineering reports and comprehensive technical specifications. Per the company, the clinical data informatics has been verified on 38 patients on the Abiomed Impella Controller at two hospitals in the United States.Notably, the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that the FDA has approved as safe and effective for High Risk PCI. Furthermore, Impella CP with SmartAssist also boasts a CE Mark approval and has already been used for treating over 60 patients at three sites.Impella Product Line: A Major Growth DriverAbiomed’s main product line -- Impella -- comprises Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP. This flagship product line continued to be growth catalyst, reflecting stellar performance in the last reported quarter as well.Expanding the Impella portfolio, the company recently announced that Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart-pumps have received PMA from the FDA for expanded use. With this, the products will now be used during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Notably, it was the second PMA in a row for the devices, which was earlier granted by the FDA to treat heart failures associated with cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiogenic shock.We encouragingly note that, in the last reported quarter, the installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 41 new U.S. hospitals, taking the total number of Impella CP sites to 1,134. Thus, the latest FDA approval for the technologically advanced Impella CP will help the company in gaining momentum while accelerating top-line contributions from this product.US Cardiac Disease Trends and the Cardiovascular MarketPer a research conducted by American College of Cardiology, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 800,000 deaths in the United States.

528,ABMD,"Patterson Companies, Inc (PDCO  -  Free Report) underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have lost 52.4% versus the industry’s increase of 10.2%. The current return is also lower than S&P 500 index’s rise of 14.4%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, unfavorable price movements, declining dental revenues and integration risks pose significant challenges for Patterson Companies.Further, management expects headwinds in the technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018 as Patterson Companies has been shifting to the new go-to market strategy with an expanded technology-based product portfolio. Currently, the company is also grappling with legal issues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line declined 2.4% in the last three months to $1.68. This shows a year-over-year decline of 28.2%. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line declined 9.7% in the last three months to 31 cents. This indicates a fall of 55.1% on a year-over-year basis.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Here we take a peek at the major issues plaguing Patterson Companies.The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and majorly consists of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition from another national, full-service firm, Henry Schein Dental — a unit of Henry Schein.In addition, there are at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level and hundreds of small local distributors. It’s mandatory for the company to constantly introduce products in the market to tide over competitive pressures. Failure to do so will dilute the company’s market share.Dwindling dental sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected constant disruption of the company’s augmentation goals. Sales in this segment fell 8.1% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Additionally, Patterson Companies’ sales of consumable dental supplies fell 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. Dental equipment sales also declined 10.6% on a constant-currency (cc) basis.The recent loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona has compelled the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges.Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company also witnesses a heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report), Genomic Health Inc (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc (VAR  -  Free Report).Abiomed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27%.

531,ABMD,"With a market capitalization of approximately $10.61 billion, Varian Medical Systems Inc (VAR  -  Free Report) has been riding high on revenue opportunity from the growing adoption of Proton Therapy and strong overseas presence in emerging countries.However, cutthroat competition in the niche spaceis a major headwind.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2.85 million, reflecting an increase of 0.9% year over year. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $4.48 per share, showing an increase of 24.4% year over year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing Varian Medicaland discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors Plaguing Varian MedicalIntensifying competition is expected to increase R&D expenditures in the growing proton therapy market, which will keep margins under pressure.Further, Varian Medical competes with large electronic companies along withsmaller and more specialized radiation therapy equipment manufacturers.Thus, cutthroat competition in the niche space is likely to raise the company’s expenditure in the near term. The oncology business in North America is witnessing a drop in capital expenditure on account of uncertainty emanating from health care reform and anticipated changes in reimbursement.Although international sales, as percentage of revenues,areincreasing, higher demand for lower-margin products from China, India and Brazil is expected to keep margins under pressure over the next several quarters.Why Should You Hold The Stock?Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian Medical. Proton therapy falls under the Particle Therapy business.Recently, the company announced the installation of a Varian Medical ProBeam cyclotron at the proton beam therapy center at University College Hospitals London NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) in London, England. The cyclotron is a core piece of equipment of the ProBeam proton therapy system. Its installation is a key milestone for every new proton therapy center.Varian Medical’s ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors, thereby causing lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system hasthe same interface used in theTrueBeam platform.Recently, Varian Medical has upgraded its ProBeam system software to ProBeam version 2.5 to enhance workflow at the site and provide better images generated by the system's integrated imager. The upgraded product will drive the company’s market share going forward.In Mar 2018, Varian Medical announced the first patient treatment at the St. Petersburg Proton Therapy Center in Russia, an important step in expanding access to proton therapy around the world.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

534,ABMD,"Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) recently announced that its flagship Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart-pumps have received Pre-Market Approval (PMA) from the FDA for expanded use. With this, the products will now be used during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.Notably, this is the second PMA in a row for the devices, which was earlier granted by the FDA to treat heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiogenic shock.Such consents affirm the effectiveness of Impella in patients diagnosed with severe coronary artery diseases, complex anatomy and additional ailments.ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus  ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus | ABIOMED, Inc. Quote The latest PMA for Impella to treat High Risk PCI was based on two studies by the FDA; PROTECT I and PROTECT II. The studies included treatment of patients with most severe conditions in the catheterization lab, with the majority being denied open-heart surgery.The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients with mild to moderately-reduced ejection fraction (EF), who were also denied open-heart surgery, owing to surgical risk factors.The acclaim further validates this ‘first of its kind’ indication for High Risk PCI and the benefit of percutaneous hemodynamic support in treating severely complex patients with mild, moderate and severely depressed EF. Why Impella?The Impella 2.5 and Impella CP are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that the FDA has approved as safe and effective for High Risk PCI. Per the FDA, the devices provide temporary ventricular support (less than six hours). It was further stated that the use of the Impella platform may reduce hemodynamic instability, beside reducing peri- and post-procedural adverse events.US Cardiac Disease Trends and the Cardiovascular MarketPer a research conducted by American College of Cardiology, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 800,000 deaths in the United States.

535,ABMD,"Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) recently announced expanded FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for its flagship Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD heart pumps. With this expanded PMA, these heart pumps can now be used to treat heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy leading to cardiogenic shock, including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM).The latest regulatory progress is an expansion of the original FDA indication to be used for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) cardiogenic shock and post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS), which was received in April 2016.The Impella Support Systems therapy aims to reduce ventricular work, to provide circulatory support for cardiac recovery and prompt assessment of the residual myocardial function.ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus  ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus | ABIOMED, Inc. Quote Data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA indication included an analysis of 93 patients from Abiomed’s FDA-reviewed study and a literature review of 109 patients treated with Impella from 32 clinical publications.Notably, Impella heart pumps are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that have been marked safe and effective by the FDA for cardiogenic shocks.Women’s InitiativeThis news is concurrent with the launch of an indication and a program called Women’s Initiative focused on education and awareness of heart recovery.For women suffering from cardiogenic shock caused by cardiomyopathy, this platform provides a new treatment option, by improving outcome around heart recovery in postpartum conditions.To note, cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that may lead to cardiogenic shock. Such shocks are fatal since the heart is unable to pump enough blood. Additionally, myocarditis is an acute form of cardiomyopathy, affecting the younger population. It is diagnosed by cardiac dysfunction and heart failure and is responsible for roughly 10% of sudden death cases in young adults.In women, PPCM occurs during pregnancy or after childbirth, mainly driven by cardiogenic shock. It is one of the leading causes for pregnancy-related deaths in the United States, with a mortality rate of 10%. The condition is often difficult to diagnose and may lead to poor outcome for the infant and threatens subsequent pregnancies as well.With Impella support, patients can have minimally-invasive therapies and avoid invasive surgeries and severe drug therapy.

536,ABMD,"On Feb 6, we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics, Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report), a major commercial laboratory services provider. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Quest Diagnostics have outperformed the broader industry over the past year. The stock has gained 8.1% against the broader industry’s 2.6% decline.We are encouraged to note that both earnings and revenues increased year over year during the recently-reported fourth quarter. Also, the company’s bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote Incidentally, Quest Diagnostics has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. It is currently refocusing on core diagnostic information services business and disciplined capital deployment.The company’s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers. We are looking forward to the company’s recently-closed buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service, a national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services. This apart, the 2018 guidance looks promising with an indication for this bullish trend to continue.Later in 2016, Quest Diagnostics came up with an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholder value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.The company expects 3-5% revenue growth for the period from 2017 to 2020. Earnings for the same time frame are expected to better revenues at a faster rate in the mid-to-high single-digit range. Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders is creating ample opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while simultaneously improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.After suffering several quarters of dull volumes, the company has finally started to see improvement in terms of both volume and pricing. However, sustainability of this progress is still doubted. Further, reimbursement woes remain.Also, Quest Diagnostics is highly disappointed with the recent CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act. In December 2017, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association came forward to support a lawsuit against the Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The lawsuit charged that the CMS, operating under the HHS purview, has failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Abiomed has an expected long-term growth rate of 31.5%. The stock has soared 61.8% over the last six months, surpassing the broader industry’s performance.athenahealth has a projected long-term growth rate of 22.3%. The stock has gained 11.8% over the last three months, ahead of the industry’s rise.Cardinal Health has an expected long-term growth rate of 8.5%. In the last 30 days, the stock has climbed 3.4%, higher than the industry’s increase.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

537,ABMD,"Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) is one of the top-performing stocks in the MedTech space.

The stock has a market cap of $51.51 billion.Let’s find out whether the company can maintain the positive trend.Robot-based da Vinci Unit Driving GrowthThe growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate higher adoption of Artificial Intelligence in the MedTech space.Intuitive Surgical’s flagship da Vinci surgical system is powered by robotic technology. The platform has bolstered the company’s foothold in the markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery. The da Vinci System has provided minimally invasive surgery to more than 3 million patients worldwide.The company launched an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. Notably, the Xi suite is designed to seamlessly integrate future innovations such as advanced instrumentation, surgical skills simulation, software upgrades and other advancements into one dynamic platform. The company can now ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. Minimally invasive surgery is becoming increasingly popular as it helps patients recover faster, thereby reducing hospitalization costs. Notably, the minimally invasive surgical instruments market is projected to reach a worth of $18.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.2% (per Markets & Markets).Although high price of the da Vinci system may hinder widespread adoption, we believe that the overwhelming benefits of minimally invasive surgery will compel surgeons and patients to use the system. This will drive the company’s system sales and improve top-line growth in the long run.In the first quarter of 2018, da Vinci procedures grew approximately 15% year over year. Intuitive Surgical replaced 185 da Vinci surgical systems, up from a 133 in the first quarter of 2017.

Emerging market revenues (15% of total revenues) amounted to $1.24 billion, up 15.5% organically (up 16.8% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 5.4% at constant exchange rate or CER (up 10.1% as reported) to $3.14 billion, driven by strong, low-teens growth in CSH, mid-single digit growth in APV, and low-single digit growth in CRHF, all at CER.CRHF sales totaled $1.63 billion, up 1.5% year over year at CER (up 5.8% as reported).

This apart, double digit growth in AF Solutions, Mechanical Circulatory Support, and TYRX in Infection Control also contributed to the growth.CSH revenues were up 12.8% at CER (up 18.7% as reported) to $81.01 billion on the back of low-20s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4.8% growth at CER (up 8.8% as reported) to $497 million, driven by low-single digit growth in both Aortic and Peripheral and mid-teens growth in endoVenous.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.24 billion, marking a 4.8% year-over-year increase at CER (down 14.1% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at comparable CER basis.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $2.13 billion were up 6.1% year over year at CER (up 9% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies and Pain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in the Spine business.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 21.3% at CER (26% as reported) to $645 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 136 basis points (bps) to 70.6% on a 4.9% rise in gross profit to $5.7 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 64 bps year over year to 29.7% owing to a 7.1% rise in research and development expenses (to $592 million) along with a 2.9% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.55 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $188 million as compared with $48 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceThe company has provided its fiscal 2019 earnings and revenues guidance. For the full year, organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 4-4.5%. Currency fluctuation is expected to negatively impact the top line by $50 million- $150 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $31.05 billion.Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.15, a 10% growth from the year-ago number at the mid-point of the range. This assumes a 5 cent benefit from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 per share falls at the upper end of the guided range.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth quarter performances. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are ABIOMED, Inc.

A Kaloroma Information article validates the country’s dominance in the field, thanks to its more than $180 billion in revenues generated from all over the world.Medical Device Tax SuspensionThe medical device industry is booming with possibilities, courtesy of the two-year suspension of the infamous 2.3% Medical Device tax. The lifting of the tax makes scope for solid research and development (R&D), which is likely to benefit companies in the long run.The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 under Obamacare, significantly affecting R&D. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax impaired medical innovation to a great extent, resulting in loss or lower job creation.To address the problems, the senate placed a temporary suspension on these taxes in the January 2016-December 2017 period.The taxes were imposed again on Jan 1, 2018, only to be suspended on Jan 22 for another two years.

545,ABMD,"To invest successfully, one needs to do extensive and in-depth research. A smart investor will never follow the herd by believing that only risky stocks can yield impressive returns. Risky stocks do prove lucrative but that’s when the market is bullish.We have created a strategy which clearly shows that a portfolio of less risky stocks can also generate impressive returns when a few parameters are taken into account. Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%. Conversely, if the market plunges, the stock will lose much more value than the market.Building a Low-Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower-than-market volatility, we added beta between 0 and 0.6 as our main criterion for screening. However, we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market. Hence to reach the winning strategy, we have considered a few additional criteria.Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks: We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 19 stocks that fit the bill:Based in Nelsonville, OH, Rocky Brands, Inc.  (RCKY  -  Free Report) is primarily involved in designing apparel and footwear. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 264.6%. We expect the stock to see year-over-year earnings growth of 29.3% in 2018.Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report), based in Philadelphia, PA, is a wholesaler and retailer of a variety of consumer goods.

547,ABMD,"On Feb 4, 2018, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the U.S. House and Senate’s decision to suspend the medical device tax for another two years has come as a breath of fresh air to medical device mammoths like Boston Scientific. Per the company, this temporary suspension will in turn allow it to continue with its plans for investing in innovative medical products. Meanwhile, the company is intent on working toward complete repeal of the MedTech tax.We are also encouraged by Boston Scientific’s major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede. This move is expected to consolidate the company’s position in the growing field of mitral regurgitation (MR) falling under its structural heart business. Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for treatment of severe MR. On a positive note, the product claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state.This apart, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance. The promising 2018 view is also impressive.On the flip side, declining worldwide pacemaker sales over the recent past continued to weigh on Boston Scientific's CRM (Customer Relationship Management) results. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company witnessed a high single-digit decline in pacemaker performance due to tough comparisons drawn with stronger revenues reaped after the U.S. launch of the company’s Brady MRI linepost in April 2016. Although of late, the company has taken several measures to rebound this trend, the near-term outlook still looks bleak.Additionally, the fate of Lotus valve issue seems in limbo for some more time for Boston Scientific as recently, the company announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe and the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall last February. In sync with the above downtrends, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 5.5% compared with the broader industry's 3% rise in the period.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Quote Notably, the preliminary figures have been reported considering the benefit of the extra four business selling days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Per management, the U.S. upper extremities business of the company delivered outstanding performance.

557,ABMD,"American businessman and fund manager, Richard Herman Driehaus developed an investment strategy based on the buy high and sell higher principle. This investment approach is ideal for investors having a tendency to take huge risk. Investors use this particular investment method to gain from momentum stocks. The success of this strategy helped Driehaus to make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

566,ABMD,"Investors interested in Medical - Instruments stocks are likely familiar with Integer (ITGR  -  Free Report) and Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now?

This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ITGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.40, while ABMD has a forward P/E of 118.54.

ABMD currently has a PEG ratio of 4.39.Another notable valuation metric for ITGR is its P/B ratio of 2.38. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ABMD has a P/B of 26.62.Based on these metrics and many more, ITGR holds a Value grade of A, while ABMD has a Value grade of D.Both ITGR and ABMD are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ITGR is the superior value option right now.

Its multi-modular platform is designed to fit the needs of any hospital size or specialty center.Notably, following the announcement, the company’s shares have inched up 0.8% to eventually close at $12.60. In the past year, Allscripts’ shares have rallied 10.4%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 5.4%. We believe such developments will provide Allscripts a competitive edge in the healthcare IT (HCIT) space.SingHealth is a healthcare group with more than 40 clinical specialties, a network of community hospitals and primary care clinics.Lately, in a bid to significantly expand its coveted FollowMyHealth platform, Allscripts acquired Florida-based HealthGrid Holding Company.

570,ABMD,"What drives shares or pulls them down after a company comes up with quarterly earnings? It’s not exactly how well a company performed in the recently concluded quarter or exhibited strong growth; it is an earnings beat or a miss which drives the market post release.This is because investors always intend to position ahead of time and fish for stocks that are likely to come up with an astounding performance. After much deliberation, Wall Street analysts forecast earnings of companies. These estimates act as investment leads.The Importance of an Earnings BeatA positive earnings surprise or an earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate. Historically, if a company’s earnings manage to beat market expectations, its stock surges post release.After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn’t tell you if it is a decelerating growth momentum. If that is the case, the company’s fundamentals are in serious question.Also, seasonal fluctuations are a vital factor in determining a company’s earnings growth. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong, then it is likely to report a sequential decline in earnings in Q1. In such cases, the growth rates are fallacious when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company.On the other hand, Wall Street analysts club their insights and the company’s guidance to derive an earnings estimate. Thus, beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check its earnings surprise history. An impressive track record generally acts as a tailwind, sending the stock higher. It indicates that the company might surpass estimates even in its next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 10.Here are five out of 10 stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report): This is a manufacturer and seller of construction and mining equipment. The stock comes from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 9%). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1.

571,ABMD,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical - Instruments sector might want to consider either Integer (ITGR  -  Free Report) or Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, both Integer and Abiomed are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ITGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.40, while ABMD has a forward P/E of 118.54. We also note that ITGR has a PEG ratio of 1.36. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ABMD currently has a PEG ratio of 4.39.Another notable valuation metric for ITGR is its P/B ratio of 2.38. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ABMD has a P/B of 26.62.Based on these metrics and many more, ITGR holds a Value grade of A, while ABMD has a Value grade of D.Both ITGR and ABMD are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ITGR is the superior value option right now.

572,ABMD,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Earnings improved 5.3% year over year.Net sales came in at $88.3 million, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 million. However, sales improved 1.6% from the prior-year figure.Meanwhile, in the past year, shares of AngioDynamics have rallied 17.9% against the industry’s decline of 12%.Geographical AnalysisU.S. net revenues in the quarter under review were $70.3 million, down 1% at constant currency (cc). Per management, the downside can be attributed to lower sales of Venous Insufficiency, PICCs, RFA (Radio Frequency Ablation) and NanoKnife product lines.International revenues totaled $18 million, up 9% at cc primarily owing to strong performance in Europe.Segmental AnalysisPeripheral Vascular (PV) businessSales in the segment came in at $52.6 million, which declined 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. Per management, growth in the Fluid Management, Angiographic catheters and AngioVac product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Thrombolytic businesses.AngioVac procedural volumes remained strong and were up 14% year over year in the reported quarter.However, the Venous Insufficiency business continued to underperform. This was due to the discontinuation of exclusive use of the EVLT (Endovenous Laser System) products by the company’s largest customer.Vascular Access (VA) businessVascular Access net sales were $23.7 million, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. Per management, growth in Ports and Dialysis products was offset by declines in PICCs.Oncology/Surgery businessSales in this segment grossed $12.1 million, up a significant 38%. The upside can be attributed to strong growth in Solero Microwave Ablation System. However, an increase in sales of NanoKnife was partially offset by lower sales of RFA system.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, gross profit totaled $47.5 million, up 12.1% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin was 53.7%, which expanded 190 basis points (bps).Adjusted operating income came in at $4.4 million against the year-over-year operating loss of $11.3 million.Financial ConditionFor the fiscal fourth quarter, AngioDynamics generated $23.8 million in operating cash flow and $23.0 million in free cash flow.FY18 at a GlanceRevenues for fiscal 2018 totaled $344.3 million, down 1.6% from the year-ago period.Earnings per share of 74 cents inched up 1.4% from a year ago.Revenues at the core Peripheral Vascular segment accounted for 58.8% of total sales.Revenues at Vascular Access contributed 26.9%, while that at Oncology/Surgery represented 14.3%.FY19 GuidanceAngioDynamics expects fiscal 2019 net sales in the range of $344-$349 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at 93 cents, above the guided range.Free cash flow is expected between $38 million and $43 million.Our TakeAngioDynamics exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 on a dull note. Solid performance by the Oncology/Surgery segment is encouraging. Surging international sales buoy optimism. The company continues to witness strong growth in its oncology ablation, Solero and NanoKnife product lines. In the fourth quarter, the company witnessed a significant expansion in gross margin. Increased R&D investments in the thrombus management portfolio are a positive.On the flip side, underperformance of the core Peripheral Vascular and Vascular Access units raise concern. In the reported quarter, AngioDynamics saw persistent headwinds in the Venous Insufficiency business and PICC product lines. Declining sales in the United States and intense competition add to the woes.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

573,ABMD,"Abiomed’s (ABMD  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings are scheduled to release on Jul 26, before the market opens.We believe that the company is set to gain from its flagship Impella product line. An impressive guidance for fiscal 2019 and a recent upgrade to the coveted S&P 500 benchmark are other tailwinds.In the last reported quarter, Abiomed posted adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25%. Earnings also skyrocketed 142.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $171.9 million, reflecting year-over-year rise of 29.8%.

Price and EPS Surprise | ABIOMED, Inc. QuoteSolid Impella Product Line Likely to Drive Q1Impella, which is the world's smallest heart pump and Abiomed’s flagship product line, has continued to be a growth driver for the company.Recently, the Impella 5.5 heart pump received CE marking approval in Europe. Notably, the first patient was successfully treated at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany. This latest acceptance further enhances Abiomed’s product portfolio. (Read more: Abiomed’s Impella 5.5 Receives CE Mark in Europe)Management awaits an approval for Impella 5.5 in the United States, which is expected to help Abiomed to significantly advance in the field of heart recovery.Moreover, the company’s Impella CP heart pump with SmartAssist also received the U.S. FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA). Additionally, Abiomed has already received CE marking approval from the European Union to market Impella CP with SmartAssist.In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed the strong adoption of the Impella product line in the United States, Germany and Japan. Management anticipates 25,000 and 50,000 patients to adopt the product line in Germany and Japan, respectively.Other Factors at PlayView ImpressiveFor fiscal 2019, the company expects total revenues of $740-$770 million, reflecting an increase of 25-30% over the prior fiscal. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $765.8 million, which lies within the projected range.S&P 500 BenchmarkRecently, this Massachusetts-based developer of medical products replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp. to join the distinguished S&P 500 index. With a portfolio of 500 leading companies that have approximately 80% coverage of the available market capitalization, the S&P 500 index is an important metric for the U.S. equities. Hence, Abiomed’s recent development is a proof of the company’s solid prospects. (Read More: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark)Cutthroat CompetitionCompetition among the treatment providers for heart-related diseases is intense. Abiomed’s products compete with a temporary cardiac assist device by Throated. The company also faces stiff competition from organizations, developing permanent heart assist products like Thoratec, Teleflex, HeartWare, Jarvik Heart and MicroMed Technology.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Abiomed this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

574,ABMD,"Insulet Corporation (PODD  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has commenced direct commercial operations in Europe for its Omnipod Insulin Management System. This development is a major breakthrough in the company’s international portfolio. Going forward, Insulet will provide sales, distribution, customer support and product services for its diabetic support system, Omnipod.With the Europe insulin pump market projected to reach a value of more than $2.4 billion by the end of 2024 (data by Market Research Hub), this achievement by Insulet is touted to be timely and strategic.Insulet’s objective to assume direct commercial operation in Europe surfaced last July. Previously, the company used to run its European business with the assistance of a local distributor named Ypsomed. The termination of the exclusive distribution agreement with Ypsomed saw Insulet form a European team of above 100 employees with extensive diabetes knowledge and expertise within the European markets.Insulet currently has 140,000 Omnipod users worldwide. We expect this number to grow fast with the latest progress in Europe. The company is confident about the infrastructure and believes, it is well-positioned to cash in on the rapidly-growing European customer base and enhancing gross margins.In this context, Insulet has tied up with Teleperformance and HealthLink, which will provide local customer care and product support along with distribution and logistics services. Insulet also entered into distribution agreements with Theras Group and Nordic Infucare in order to receive complete service distribution of Omnipod in Italy as well as in the Nordic markets.Insulin Pump Growth Prospects in EuropeGoing by a Market Research Hub report, the European insulin pump market has extremely high potential, backed by the surging diabetes population. Factors contributing to the growth of insulin pump in Europe are the increasing ageing population, rising prevalence of diabetes, growing awareness on the benefits of insulin pump, higher per capita disposable income and progressive diabetes infrastructure.With insulin pumps gradually gaining popularity over traditional techniques, the adoption rate has shot up among diabetes patients in Europe. Needless to say, this latest strategic initiative by Insulet is going to reinforce the company’s global operation to a large extent.Share PerformanceOver the past six months, Insulet has consistently outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has rallied 25.6% compared with the industry’s 5.4% rise.Zacks Rank & Key PicksInsulet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

578,ABMD,"In a bid to enhance food safety and deliver world-class warewashing results in restaurants, Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) recently launched the SMARTPOWER Program. Notably, the platform’s focus is on warewashing — a process of collecting dirty kitchen ware and cutlery, washing and rinsing them.The dynamic SMARTPOWER platform reduces labor, water and energy costs. Per management, the program will be rolled out this year in the United States and later in Europe.We believe, the latest development is likely to help Ecolab fortify its position in the food-hygiene space. In fact, the company recently launched a dynamic Health Department Intelligence (HDI) platform as well, to focus on food safety. The HDI platform retrieves and manages health department inspection data for foodservice operators and provides insights to help address food safety risks. This will help the company improve health inspection performance and manage food safety risks efficiently (read more: Ecolab Rolls Out HDI for Improved Food Surveillance).Supported by developments like these, Ecolab’s shares have rallied 14.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.4% in a year’s time.Why SMARTPOWER?SMARTPOWER is a complete warewashing program that uses proprietary chemistry and advanced cloud computing to provide skilled service, resulting in cost-effective operations, especially for restaurateurs. Per management, the advanced new chemistry helps in decomposing the buildup on wares and prevents soils from reattaching.Moreover, real-time insights on warewashing performance and personalized service will help customers identify the trends in operations. This can reduce customers’ daily dish racks up to 10%, thereby lowering the total cost.The positive results followed extensive testing across 300 foodservice environments in 21 countries. Per management, users of SMARTPOWER have reported a significant increase in wares usable for guests after the first wash, which eliminates the need to rewash them.According to bizfluent, labor is the single largest expense category for majority of restaurants. The average labor cost for a financially sustainable restaurant is 30-35% of gross sales, with 20% going to pay wage-earning staff such as servers and an additional 10-15% going to pay salaried workers such as managers. The use of real-time data in its applications has helped the company bolster its footprint in the Healthcare IT space.Market ProspectsPer Orbis Research, industry analysts forecast that the Commercial Food services Equipment market in the United States will witness a CAGR of 5.51% during the period 2017-2021.On the other hand, ResearchAndMarkets opines that the global healthcare IT solutions market is expected to reach $223.16 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 13.7% during the period of 2018 to 2023.Thus, it can be concluded that Ecolab’s move has been timely and strategic.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEcolab currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

579,ABMD,"On Jun 25, 2018, we have initiated our coverage on PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (PRAH  -  Free Report). Notably, PRA Health's organic growth remains strong. Also, the company’s international business is capitalizing on great prospects. However, escalating direct cost remains a concern for PRA Health. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, shares of this renowned global Contract Research Organization (CRO) have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has rallied 28.1% compared with the broader industry 11.7% rise.The company continues to demonstrate solid organic revenue growth. In the first quarter of 2018, organic revenue growth was 15% at constant exchange rate or CER. Symphony integration process is also progressing well with PRA Health expecting to complete the procedure by 2018 end.PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Price PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Price | PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Quote PRA Health is highly optimistic about this $530-million acquisition, expected to enhance its ability to serve customers throughout the clinical research and commercial development process with technologies providing data and analytics.We are also encouraged by the company’s diversified client base with top five customers representing approximately 40% of revenues for the last-reported quarter.The company has been strategically expanding its Asia Pacific operations since 2000 and has supported 345 clinical trials in the region at 4300 plus sites across Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. In March 2018, the company was honoured with the best CRO label in Asia. PRA Health’s focus on the emerging markets looks extremely significant since a point of saturation and growth instability continue to grip the developed markets.On the flip side, the company persistently incurs direct costs, primarily on increased labor-related costs in its Clinical Research segment as it continues to hire billable staff for growth support. The increase in direct costs also included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $14 million as compared to the year-ago period tally. Within Data Solutions segment, direct cost shot up mainly due to raised salary and benefit. Moreover, the company  remains pressed underthe tough capital spending environment.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

580,ABMD,"Shares of Opko Health, Inc. (OPK  -  Free Report) have gained 41.9% since the release of first-quarter 2018 results on May 8. The rally was backed by a narrower-than-expected loss per share and solid pharmaceutical business. In the past three months, the stock has rallied 37.6% against the industry’s decline of 12.4%.   In the quarter under review, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company incurred adjusted loss of 8 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. However, the loss widened 33.3% from the prior-year quarter tally. Quarter Highlights Revenues in the first quarter grossed $254.9 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. Nevertheless, the top line decreased from $266.4 million registered in the year-ago quarter. Segment Details Revenues from Services came in at $211.3 million, down 7.6% from the year-ago quarter. Per management, the downside can be attributed to volume decline of approximately 3% at the clinical lab. Pharmaceutical Products revenues totaled $27.9 million, up 25.7% year over year. Per management, the company generated $3.7 million of revenues from sales of RAYALDEE in the reported quarter. At Transfer of Intellectual Property, revenues raked in $15.7 million, up slightly from $15.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Opko Health, Inc. Price and Consensus Opko Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Opko Health, Inc. QuoteMargins In the reported quarter, gross profit totaled $100.8 million, down 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin was 39.5%, which contracted 240 basis points (bps). Operating expenses amounted to $124.4 million, down 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, Opko Health incurred an operating loss of $42.6 million, down from $45.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Guidance In the second quarter of 2018, Opko Health expects revenues from services between $205-$225 million. Product revenues are anticipated to be within $25-$30 million, including RAYALDEE revenues in the $4-$5 million band. Revenues from the transfer of intellectual property are projected between $15 million and $20 million. Operating expenses are expected to be in line with the first quarter of 2018 at $295-$310 million range. For 2018, effective tax rate is projected to be in single digits. Our Take Opko Health wrapped the first quarter of 2018 on a tepid note. The company’s loss was narrower than expected, while revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company rides on its pharmaceutical business, which registered a year-over-year increase in revenues. Also, a significant gain from RAYALDEE is noteworthy. Furthermore, Opko Health is optimistic about its 4Kscore utilization, which witnessed solid growth in the first quarter. A year-over-year surge in the company’s R&D expenditures reflects increased focus on innovation. However, declining margins is worrisome. Sales decline at the company’s core Service segment is an added concern. Key Picks A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

581,ABMD,"On Jun 22, we issued an updated research report on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). The company’s robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products including the next-generation chemistry analyzer, Catalyst One, are key growth drivers over the near term. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, this leading molecular diagnostic company has outperformed its industry. The stock has increased 12.9% against the industry’s 12.4% decrease. Notably, IDEXX continues to demonstrate strong organic growth, driven by robust sales at the Companion Animal Group (CAG) business, fueled by a firm global Catalyst uptake.International revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were up 11% organically, driven by 13% organic gains in international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. This reflected continued consumable revenue gains, supported by Catalyst instrument base, increased average testing utilization and sturdy growth in European lab revenues.The companion animal market fundamentals remain safe and sound with tremendous global runway for growth. Additionally, we are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States as well as the international markets including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention.IDEXX’s innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s healthy top-line growth was driven by considerable contributions from its rest of the business segments. A raised EPS guidance for 2018 was also encouraging.Additionally, the company boasts a strong cash balance, allowing it to carry out share repurchases.Meanwhile, a majority of IDEXX’s consolidated revenues is being derived from the sale of products in the international markets. Thus, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate, relative to other currencies, had a negative impact on revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. money as well as on profits drawn from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally. For 2018, adverse currency translations affected adjusted earnings per share to the tune of 4 cents. Also, the company’s heavy dependence on third-party distributors is a drag.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp.

Consequently, other companies that meet the criteria are added to the list as replacement to the deleted stocks.Notably, Abiomed will be replacing Wyndham Worldwide Corp.  in the S&P 500 index. The company will be added to the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Benefits for Abiomed With a portfolio of 500 leading companies that have approximately 80% coverage of the available market capitalization, the S&P 500 index is an important metric for the U.S. equities.Any company reserving its forte in the S&P 500 stature should have a market capitalization of more than $4 billion. Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $17.46 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. MedTech industry.We believe that the news should provide a solid boost for Abiomed’s shareholders, which has successfully met all inclusion criterias to join the S&P 500 list. The company’s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. The stock has returned 182.2%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s rise of 12.6%.Shares are expected to move higher as Abiomed's latest developments indicate probabilities of the company's penetration into the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market.Key Factors Driving AbiomedImpella, Abiomed’s flagship product line, has continued to be the key growth driver. Impella is the world's smallest heart pump. It is a support system of percutaneous, catheter-based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart.Recently, the Impella 2.5 was used successfully to treat a 68-year old cardiac patient at Mitsui Memorial Hospital, one of the leading cardiovascular centers in Japan. Such incidents elucidate strong clinical demand for Impella overseas.Additionally, the installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 41 new U.S. hospitals, taking the total count of Impella CP sites to 1,134. The installed customer base for Impella 5.0 heart pumps grew by 14 new U.S. hospitals, taking the total number of Impella 5.0 sites to 498. Further, Abiomed opened 36 new sites of Impella RP for a total of 222 hospitals, which set a record for patients supported. In the reported quarter, the Advisory Board, an independent expert healthcare consultant company acquired by United Healthcare, circulated two additional publications referencing Impella.Broadening its flagship Impella heart pumps portfolio, Abiomed recently announced the receipt of FDA Pre-Market Approval (PMA) along with SmartAssist, also featuring an optical sensor in April, 2018. The company plans a controlled roll-out of the technologically advanced heart pump at hospital sites with developed heart recovery protocols over the next fiscal year.The recent CE mark for the Impella 5.5 in Europe enhanced the product line significantly and enabled the company to advance in the field of heart recovery.In the recently reported fourth quarter, Impella heart pumps garnered worldwide revenues worth $198.3 million, up 42% year over year. In the United States, Impella raked in $146.2 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Internationally, revenues generated from Impella heart pumps were $22.1 million, up a whopping 107%.Lucrative Market Trends for Coronary Heart DiseasesWe believe that Abiomed will continue to benefit from the rising number of patients suffering from coronary heart diseases (CHD) in the United States.Per data available from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CHD is the most common type of heart disease that claims approximately 380,000 lives annually. Importantly, the United States bears $108.9 billion each year for CHD, which includes the cost of health care services, medications and lost productivity.Abiomed’s product line focuses on procedures, offers devices which are minimally invasive and help patients overcome the trauma of open surgeries. The company’s products are becoming increasingly popular in lowering patient recovery time and saving hospitalization costs.Estimates Moving UpBuoyed by the these favorable tidings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter earnings have inched up 1.3% to 80 cents per share in a month’s time.

583,ABMD,"Trump’s protectionist stance on trade led to sluggish trading on Wall Street. This is especially true, as a series of tariff talks between the United States and its other major allies are intensifying fears of a trade war and could even trigger a global recession.Tariff TalksTrade war fears surfaced in March when Trump levied a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports on countries around the world. The action has prompted a retaliatory action from U.S. allies and tit-for-tat import tariffs.The turmoil intensified in recent weeks when Trump unveiled the list of Chinese goods worth $50 billion targeted for a 25% tariff, leading to retaliation from China with duties of “the same scale and strength.” In response, the United States again threatened to impose tariffs of up to $400 billion on Chinese goods on top of the $50 billion worth goods. Tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, the first of a potential total of $450 billion are due to take effect on Jul 6.Additionally, the latest report from the Wall Street revealed that Trump is seeking to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China.The trade dispute with European Union (EU) also deepened on Jun 22 after Trump tweeted that he would impose another 25% tariff, targeting imported autos from the European Union. The response came following the EU’s threat of 25% duties on $3.2 billion worth of American goods exported to the 28-member bloc, starting Jun 22, against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum.Canada and Mexico have also threatened against the use of American steel and aluminum imports. Canada is seeking duties on steel imports from the United States and on other goods including playing cards, inflatable boats, yogurt and toilet papers. The total value of American goods subject to tariff is $12.8 billion, effective Jul 1. Mexico plans to retaliate by targeting products from congressional districts that Trump’s Republican Party is fighting to retain in the November election. It would impose levies on a wide range of U.S. goods, some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products “up to an amount comparable to the level of damage” linked to U.S. tariffs.Market ImpactThe round of sanctions and retaliation has intensified the fears of a global trade war that would hurt the worldwide economy and corporate profits, particularly at big U.S. exporters. As such, large-cap stocks are struggling for the past three months given their substantial exposure to these countries.However, there are still winners in many corners of the large-cap space that are easily surviving the trade turmoil.

584,ABMD,"With a market capitalization of approximately $2.54 billion, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.’s (MMSI  -  Free Report) acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth through the expansion of product offerings in all business segments. Favorable prospects in the HeRO product line also bodes well.However, higher consolidation in the healthcare industry exerts pressure on the prices of Merit Medical’s products. Cutthroat competition and lack of direct sales in many countries are other headwinds. Based on these mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $848.4 million, reflecting an increase of 16.6% year over year. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.65 per share, showing an increase of 28.9% year over year.Here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing Merit Medical and discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Merit Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Merit Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Merit Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors Plaguing Merit MedicalThe medical products industry is highly competitive. Merit Medical competes globally in several market areas, including diagnostic and interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general as well asthoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopaedic spine surgery and many more.In the interventional cardiology, radiology, gastroenterology, endoscopy, general surgery, thoracic surgery and pulmonology markets, Merit Medical competes with large international, multi-divisional medical supply companies such as Cardinal Health, Boston Scientific Corporation, Medtronic, Abbott, Teleflex, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Stryker Corporation and Terumo Corporation.Also, the company faces aggressive competition from medium-size companies like B. Braun, Uresil, BTG, Olympus Medical, Edwards Lifesciences, Argon, CONMED, AngioDynamics, Medcomp and U.S. Endoscopy.Why Should You Still Hold?Merit Medical’s HeRO (Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow) product line has been a key contributor to growth. HeRO Graft, Super HeRO Adapter and HeRO Ally Revision Kit are the three platforms comprising theHeRO family of dialysis devices. Considering the solid global prospects of hemodialysis solutions, the product line is likely to provide Merit Medical with a competitive edge in the MedTech markets.Notably, the HeRo product line was acquired by Merit Medical from CryoLifein 2017. Per management, the ‘Think HeRO Graft Training program’ in the platform is likely to provide substantial scope over the long run.Of all the three HeRO lines, HeRO Graft is the most important owing to  strong cost-saving efficiencies. HeRO Graft is a fully subcutaneous vascular access system, intended for use in maintaining long-term vascular access for chronic hemodialysis patients who have failing fistulas, grafts or are catheter dependent due to a central venous blockage. Per management, HeRO Graft enables cost savings of more than $3,100 (per patient/year) to the dialysis center when converting catheter-dependent patients to the HeRO Graft.Favorable Price PerformanceMerit Medical outperformed its industry in a year's time. The company’s shares have returned almost 34.8% compared with the industry's rise of 7.6%.

586,ABMD,"On Jun 26, we issued an updated research report on Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report). The company has been seeing certain major developments overseas. However, a tough competitive landscape raises concern.This New Jersey- based company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of surgical implants and medical instruments for use in neurosurgery, extremity reconstruction, orthopedics, and general surgery. The stock has been outperforming its industry over the past three months. Per the latest stock movement, it has gained 16.9% against 1.4% decline of the industry.In spite of facing foreign exchange fluctuations across its international business, Integra LifeSciences has been successfully growing overseas. The company is looking to invest in the Asian market in order to grow business much faster than the growth in the United States and also across certain parts of its international businesses. In line with the growth strategy, the company is preparing to launch products in China and Japan. Turning to Europe, management feels encouraged about the growth potential in the region with Tissue Technologies business and CUSA Clarity product slated for launch soon.We are also upbeat about the company’s Regenerative Technologies, which is the largest franchise under Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies.

It has also successfully completed the transition of the Codman business in China.Meanwhile, Integra LifeSciences faces intense competition in the surgical implants and medical instruments market.

Moreover, consolidation in the industry could lead to intense pricing pressure.Also, significant margin contraction caused by escalating costs and expenses raise concerns.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

587,ABMD,"With a market capitalization of approximately $56.58 billion, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) continues to benefit from growing adoption of the company’s da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, consistent innovation and solid recurring revenue base.However, unfavorable foreign exchange, procedure adoption risk, lower capital spending by hospitals and increasing regulatory headwinds are major concerns.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.61 billion, reflecting an increase of 15.2%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is pegged at $10.26, showing a rise of 14.1%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the primary factors that have been plaguing Intuitive Surgical and discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteCompetition Mar ProspectsIntuitive Surgical has been enjoying a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device called da Vinci back in 2000.Post the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical has intensified. Reports suggest that the news had a negative impact onthe company’s price movement, even though the device is not expected to compete directly with da Vinci.MedTech giant Medtronic is another major threat. Per sources,the company has been working on its surgical robot and plans to launch it in 2018.Why Should you Hold?The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that allows surgeon’s hand gestures to be translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient’s body. da Vinci has bolstered the company’s foothold in the  markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery. The system has facilitatedminimally invasive surgery to more than 3 million patients worldwide.Recently, the da Vinci Surgical System has been observed to cure patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia.The company launched an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology — da Vinci X — recently. Notably, the Xi suite is designed to seamlessly integrate future innovations, such as advanced instrumentation, surgical skills simulation, software upgrades and other advancements into one dynamic platform. The company can now ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries.Minimally invasive surgery is becoming increasingly popular as it helps patients recover faster and reduces hospital costs. Notably, the minimally invasive surgical instruments market is projected to reach a worth of $18.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.2% (Markets & Markets). Although high price of the system may hinder widespread adoption, we believe that the benefits of minimally invasive surgery will propelsurgeons and patients to use the system. This will drive the company’s system sales and improve top-line growth in the long run.Favorable Share Price MovementIntuitive Surgical has outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have surged almost 50.8%, against the industry’s decline of 2.4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 12.9%.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

588,ABMD,"There is no sign of respite from the ongoing market uncertainty due to apprehensions of a trade war. On the one hand, Asian stocks have started to revive on improvement in U.S-North Korea relationship while on the other hand, investors are restraining themselves on possibilities of trade loss due to the proposed China trade restrictions.Medical Device Caught in the Trade War StormGoing by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billionin medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus.Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade. MedTech trade group AdvaMed made a more specific comment claiming that the Chinese tariffs account for more than half of all MedTech imports from the region (in a MassDevice article). The trade group stated that, “for our industry, the proposed additional tariff of 25% on imports of nearly $3bn of medical technology products is the wrong action at the wrong time.""AdvaMed countered United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) claim of China’s unfair trade practices in medical devices harming U.S. exports significantly. The group argued that the U.S. trades with China on medical devices on the USTR list are in fact in slight surplus. Accordingly, if the proposed tariffs on diagnostic products and other medical devices made in both the United States and China are not dropped, it may result in trade imbalance.Per RBC Capital Markets estimates, if the proposed 25% tariffs get implemented, this could cost the medical device industry up to $1.5 billion each year.Going by the latest update, per a Financial Express report, a bipartisan group of 40 lawmakers has urged US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer to remove $3 billion worth of medical devices from the list of Chinese products proposed by the Trump administration for additional tariff.Investors in Trouble?With the risk of a trade war between the two largest economies heightening, investment in medical device stocks is taking a backseat.The proposed imposition of additional tariff on Chinese products and China’s retaliatory efforts have resulted in widespread share losses so far in the Medical device sector. Bearish emerging market trade outlook has dealt severe blows to the bigwigs. We note that the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.In this regard, we note that stocks like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), GE Healthcare (GE  -  Free Report) and others are witnessing considerable weakness since Mar 23, when talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds. We note that Medtronic earlier bought orthopedic devices maker, China Kanghui Holdings and since then has been consistently shipping products to the United States from this operation. If these shipments are now subject to additional tariff, it will definitely hamper the company’s China business.GE Healthcare has also urged the administration to remove certain parts from the list of Chinese products for additional tariff. Going by a Mass Device report, China produced parts are essential for a number of GE’s devices, including ultrasound machines, patient monitors, MRI machines, CT machines and X-ray machines, some of which are produced by GE owned facilities in China while others are produced by local Chinese companies.3 MedTech Stocks to Counter the Trade Restriction HazardConcerns about the implementation of the trade tariffs on MedTech products have been weighing on stocks lately. Even though the market has not yet shown any steady plunge, such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward.We have shortlisted three MedTech stocks, which, in spite of the tumultuous market conditions, are well poised on strong fundamentals and timely strategic developments. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Growth Score and Zacks Rank.We have narrowed down our choices with the help of our new Style Score system.Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): Although, the company has a strong presence in overseas markets, it has no such business relation with China. Hence, in spite of considering international diversification as a core component of the company’s strategy, the company can very well sidestep the volatility of the U.S.-China trade war and continue to enjoy the bountiful scope offered by emerging markets. The company, in fact, is benefiting from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems.Baxter has a Growth Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 16.3%, higher than the industry’s 10.3%.Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report): In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Varian Medical’s global market share growth was driven by orders-based share gains in EMEA. In fact, Varian Medical was awarded a contract for eight TrueBeam systems in Stockholm, Sweden. Further, the company signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based, Sirtex, which focused on interventional oncology therapies. This apart, Varian Medical has recently announced the opening of a new facility in Jundiaí, Brazil, which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Although Varian Medical has business in Greater China, the company’s huge global base outside the country shields it from severe damage that may occur as a result of the trade restriction.Varian Medical has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2.ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report): Just like Baxter, despite having strong international foothold, ABIOMED does not have any significant presence in China. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Germany and Japan witnessed strong adoption of the exclusive Impella product line. In Germany, revenues grew 95% in the fourth quarter and 70% in fiscal 2018.

598,ABMD,"The U.S. Medical Device industry trend in 2018 is reflective of extensive discovery and innovation in the life sciences industry over the past few years.Per a study published by CNBC, medical device companies have gained importance in the healthcare world on improved research and development (R&D) of technology. Far-reaching innovation like gene therapy, newer drug combinations, patient monitoring with the help of big data this year will shape up the medical fraternity of the United States.Tax Suspension to Fuel R&DThe Medical Device market has further gained momentum owing to the recent two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% Medical Device tax. The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 as part of Obamacare on MedTech manufacturers, significantly restricting R&D activities.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.However, it is to be seen whether the tax will be fully eliminated or resumed after the two-year period. For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activity in this space, which bodes well for MedTech companies.Notably, in the past month, the medical instruments industry has rallied 3.8% against the S&P 500 index’s return of 1.5%.R&D Leads to Revolution in MedTechThe MedTech space currently offers unprecedented opportunities for growth and market share expansion. Solid investment in R&D has helped manufacturers use the benefits from big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and medical mechatronics.The industry is also catching up with the digital-data age. Enormous size of data can be captured through technology for arriving at business insights. This helps the healthcare sector provide better care and reduce wastage. The latest trend of adopting electronic health record (EHR) services in the U.S. MedTech space has also been gaining popularity.Some of the major HCIT (Healthcare I.T.) bigwigs, which have carved out a niche in the big-data domain, are Cerner Corporation and athenahealth, Inc. These companies are making significant investments in R&D to boost up their EHR platforms.Meanwhile, medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry, providing innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices and development of low-cost disposable devices.Engineering concern eInfochips believes that mechatronics is the future of medical devices. The benefits of Mechatronics have been seen in the form of 3D printing, cancer study and development of better medication for deadly diseases.Notably, Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) minimally-invasive da Vinci surgical system and Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) robotic-arm assisted surgery platform, Mako, deserve a mention here.Choosing the Winning StocksGiven the favorable scenario, investment in Medical Device stocks with strong potential seems to be a wise choice.

601,ABMD,"The first of half of this year was mostly topsy-turvy, with major indices failing to make a big move. While a group of investors showed a lot of optimism on corporate earnings and upbeat labor data, many fear that the Fed’s stance to raise interest rate hikes faster might derail the market’s upward journey. Intensifying trade tensions between the United States and China may also force the equity market to take a dive after years of growth.While many investors are reducing their exposure to equities, investors shouldn’t completely move away from stocks in the second half of this year. Instead, they should invest in such stocks that are unperturbed by market gyrations and fundamentally strong.Bulls & Bears End the First Half in a DrawSo far this year, the equity market has been through bouts of volatility, with both bulls and bears finishing the first half of the year almost in a draw. While the S&P 500 is up a meagre 2.3% so far this year, the Dow is down 1.2%. This slight year-to-date movement indicates that even though the general mood is positive, investors do see a lot of downside risks to the market.Needless to say, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has also seen widespread gyrations in the first half. The volatility index tanked almost 20% since the start of April, which in turn showed how much it actually moved up in the first quarter when inflation-related concerns caused it to more than double in a single day. The VIX has jumped 40% so far in 2018.Bull & Bear Tug-of-WarOptimists could easily point to rapid growth in corporate profits and a healthy labor market. The current unemployment rate is at an 18-year low of 3.8%, while the jobless claims are almost at the lowest level since the early 1970’s. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) further predicted that the unemployment rate will drop to 3.5% by the end of this year. Wage growth, by the way, rose 2.7% on a year-over-year basis last month and Goldman expects it to accelerate further to a range of 3% to 3.25%.These positives easily offset growing concerns that America is in the late stage of its economic cycle and that few fund managers expect the equity market to pick up from here. But, it’s true that the equity market did trade in a tight range for months. Major bourses like the Dow and the S&P have been in correction throughout the second quarter, the longest stretch since 2008. This is all because of the policy uncertainty that leads to a rise in tensions between the United States and its major trading partners. The stock market moved up and down on doubts over whether the tariffs signified the opening salvo of negotiations and the possibilities of whether they will get implemented. On the domestic front, issues related to Internet companies also raised concerns of a more aggressive regulatory environment against some of the industry’s biggest names.Amid all these, the Fed has become less accommodative. It has been slowly changing its monetary policy by hiking interest rates and trimming its balance sheet. Lest we forget, a low interest rate environment and the central bank’s bond-buying program helped the equity market scale north in the past decade.This change in Fed’s policy, in the meantime, has helped the yield in the U.S. 10-Year Treasury note to move up to 2.82% from 2.41% at the beginning of the year. In February, it rose to 2.94%, a four-year high. With yields rising, investors have pulled money out of stocks and have invested them in bonds. As per Morningstar Direct, nearly $2.26 billion has been pulled from all equity-based funds so far this year, while almost $110 billion has flowed into taxable bond funds.Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel, has aptly said that “years of accumulated policy distortion, a lack of Fed maneuvering room and shock waves from policy are the S&P 500 risks we see, but not corporate earnings or economic growth.”5 Best Stocks to Buy for the Second HalfWith fundamentals remaining strong but risks rising, investors should take a conservative stance while designing their portfolio in the second half. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.But, even though low beta stocks pose less risk they provide lower returns. So, in order to boost your returns, we have further zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision. Rising earnings estimates generally indicate that the stock will outperform the market in the near future. After all, earnings estimates are one of the most powerful metrics that measure the fundamental strength of a company. To top it, these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

603,ABMD,"Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) is an underperforming company in the MedTech space. Stiff competition and a soft first quarter of 2018 are major headwinds at the moment.In the past year, Cerner’s stock has lost 5%, against the industry’s rally of 6.3%.In the last 30 days, 11 estimates moved south versus no upward revision, indicating analysts’ pessimism regarding the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share dropped 7.6% to 61 cents. Cerner has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which indicates possibilities of underperformance in the near term.Therefore, it is time to dump the stock from your portfolio.Why Should You Offload?View DownbeatFor the second quarter of 2018, Cerner expects revenues within $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.38 billion, within the given range.Cerner expects 2018 revenues in the range of $5.33-$5.45 billion, down from a range of $5.45 billion to $5.65 billion.

604,ABMD,"DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industryin the last six months. The company’s shares have lost 27.9% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 5.1%. The current level is also significantly lower than the S&P 500 index’s return of 5.3%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, a sluggish first quarter, declining margins and foreign exchange headwinds are significant obstacles for the company.Battered by the above challenges, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter adjusted earnings is currently pegged at 60 cents, down 20% in the last two months. This also marks a 7.7% fall year over year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Below we take a sneak peek at the major issues plaguing DENTSPLY SIRONA.The company expects gross margins and operating margins to remain flat or slightly down on a year-over-year basis in the coming quarters. This is because underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions.Further, as the company is committed to delivering $100 million in operating cost savings by fiscal 2019, it expects more than half of the amount in 2018. Although the savings should result in increased margin over time, the same in2018 are likely to be affected.By the end of the first quarter of 2018, DENTSPLY SIRONA confirmed that it expects 2018 full-year operating margins to be down between 100 basis points (bps) and 150 bps on a year-over-year basis.In this regard, DENTSPLY SIRONA reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents in the first quarter of 2018, down 8.2% year over year. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.1%.  Net sales fell 1.1% year over year to $956.1 million on a constant-currency (cc) basis. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $944.7 million. Management expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous range of $2.70-$2.80. Revenues are projected to rise 2% at cc.DENTSPLY SIRONA has solid international presence. Therefore, a strong U.S. dollar, especially against the euro as well as emerging market currencies had a negative impact on results. We believe that currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018.The company faces significant pricing pressure due to intense competition. DENTSPLY SIRONA conducts its operations, domestic and foreign, under highly-competitive market conditions. The size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and regionally.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ABIOMED, Inc.

Moreover, the company also received approvals for a few products alongside achieving clinical trial milestones.Let's see how things are shaping up within these sub-segments before the first-quarter results. Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote Electrophysiology: In Electrophysiology, which accounted for 13.9% of Medical Devices revenues, Abbott strengthened its position with the launch of Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in the United States and Europe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Electrophysiology revenues of $359 million indicates an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.

619,ABMD,"Medical Instrument bigshots — Abiomed Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) and STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) — are pitted against each other in the prospective U.S. MedTech space, which is estimated to reach $343 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 4.6% (per Lucintel). Notably, these companies benefit from R&D innovation, increasing consolidation and the recent tax abatement.Having similar business models, it often becomes difficult to decide which investment option is better. Further, as things stand now, the scales apparently look evenly balanced as the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Thus, here we take a detailed look at the fundamentals of these companies to determine which stock is currently positioned better in the Medical Instruments space.Detailed AnalysisWith a market cap of $13.3 billion, Abiomed is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing of medical products, designed to assist or replace the pumping function during heart failures.STERIS develops, manufactures and markets infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction, as well as surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services. The company has a market cap of $8 billionMeanwhile, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Price Performance: While the companies have outperformed the industry (up 15.4%) in the past year, Abiomed’s shares have fared better. In fact, Abiomed’s price performance is expected to improve as the latest developments signify probabilities of the company's penetration into the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market.Abiomed’s shares surged 136.2% in the last 12 months, higher than the 34.5% rally of STERIS.Consequently, Abiomed wins over STERIS when price performance is to be considered. Earnings Growth Projections: For Abiomed, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is pegged at $2.29 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 95.7%. The stock has long-term expected earnings growth rate of 31.5%. For STERIS, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.13 for fiscal 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 9.8%.Abiomed wins another round.Sales Growth Projections: For Abiomed, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $168.9 million for the next quarter, reflecting 27.6% rise from the prior year. For STERIS, the consensus estimate for sales is projected at $646.7 million for the next quarter, indicating a rise of almost 6.4% year over year.Abiomed has an edge here as well.What’s Driving Abiomed?Abiomed’s extensive product portfolio and robust demand for its Impella line of products will continue to serve as key growth catalysts over the next several years.Impella, Abiomed’s flagship product line, has consistently been a growth driver. Impella is the world's smallest heart pump. It is a support system of percutaneous, catheter-based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart.The platform reflects stellar performance in the third quarter. In the United States, the PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. The company’s Impella adoption increased a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. It was driven by the company’s clinical benefits and previous FDA approvals.Outside the United States, revenues from Impella heart pumps totaled $17.3 million and was up 94% year over year, predominantly from Germany, which recorded $11.4 million, up 71%. Additionally, the Company recorded $1.1 million in revenues from Japan.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company delivered some breakthroughs in terms of record earnings and revenue growth. Per management, operational excellence and discipline helped the company achieve the highest gross and operating margins to date.ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus | ABIOMED, Inc. Quote STERIS: A Solid ContenderThe bulk of STERIS’ revenues are obtained from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Growth in these industries is primarily driven by aging global population, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years.Further, these industries are dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies and general economic conditions. With increasing global life expectancy, a larger aging population increases the demand for medical procedures. This, in turn, translates into higher consumption of single use medical devices and surgical kits processed by STERIS.Considering the consistent success achieved by the company in offering varied medical equipment to its customers, we believe that STERIS holds huge potential to expand its foothold in these industries.The current macroeconomic environment across the globe has affected STERIS’ financial operations. Governments and insurance companies continue to look for ways to contain the rising cost of healthcare.This might put pressure on players in the healthcare industry, STERIS being no exception. Increases in prices or lesser availability of raw materials as well as oil and gas might impair STERIS’ procurement of necessary materials for product manufacture.The company competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several players that have robust product portfolios and global reach as well as a number of small companies with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.STERIS plc Price and Consensus STERIS plc Price and Consensus | STERIS plc Quote To ConcludeOur comparative analysis indicates that Abiomed is positioned better than STERIS, considering price performance, earnings growth expectations and sales expectations.Key PicksA few other top-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).Abaxis, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.1%.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.1%.

620,ABMD,"On Jan 8, we issued an updated research report on Phibro Animal Health Corporation (PAHC  -  Free Report). The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This is a New Jersey-based leading globally diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. Over the last 30 days, it has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 6.5% compared with the 5.2% growth of the broader industry.Notably, Phibro ended the second quarter of fiscal 2017 on a mixed note with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues declining marginally on a year-over-year basis.  On a positive note, Animal Health has continued to remain a key contributor segment-wise, delivering growth over the last few quarters. Per Phibro, its animal health products are excellent in preventing, controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as increasing nutrition to improve health. We believe, a diverse product portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world.Phibro has extended its reach beyond the United States to enter Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific besides Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia wherein poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. The company expands its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the economic turmoil in Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has potential to maintain the momentum.On the flip side, Medicated feed additives (MFA) business was weak in the United States in the last quarter. Approximately, $4.2 million of that business decline was due to reduced sales of medically important antimicrobials, primarily driven by the change in consumer preferences and the less use of certain antimicrobials in the market. Additionally, an unfavorable timing of certain customer orders hampered the business.Also, a persistent decline in Mineral Nutrition segment sales is likely to be a drag on business. Customer consolidation can also affect Phibro’s revenues. Plus, a negative currency movement and a tough competitive scenario continue to pose as other headwinds.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and ABIOMED Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report). While Bio-Rad and Centene sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), ABIOMED carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank Stocks Here.Bio-Rad’s long-term growth rate is 25%.

621,ABMD,"On January 5th, we issued an updated research report on Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bruker has been trading above the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has returned 18.7%, higher than the 6% gain of the broader industry during the period.In the last three quarters, Bruker’s NANO Surfaces group business realized profitability owing to prior restructuring and cost actions. In the last-reported third quarter 2017, high-single-digit growth was driven by contributions from Hysitron nanoindenting product’s acquisition in January 2017 and improved results at the AXS business.Moving on, the company’s strategic acquisition activity has also been encouraging. For instance, the company recently announced the completion of its Germany-based MERLIN’s buyout. Products of the acquired company can complement Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper platform.More good news is that Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper franchise has grown into an impressive system worth approximately $90 million per annum. We are happy to note that demand for the MALDI Biotyper is increasing in the applied markets, specifically for food, feed and beverage categories/segments.Based on recent developments witnessed in its product portfolio, management believes that Bruker is poised to double its microbiology business over the next four-five years. The company’s raised 2017 guidance is also indicative of brighter prospects.On the flip side, Bruker conducts 80% of its business in the international markets. As a result, adverse currency fluctuations continue to incur losses for the company. Also, headwinds like unfavorable economic conditions and an intense competition continue to pose threats.Other Key PicksSome other top ranked stocks in the broader medical space are, ABIOMED Inc.

International net sales were $18.4 million, up 4.6% on a year-over-year basis, owing to robust sales in the Oncology/Surgery business.Declines in Venus Insufficiency, Core Businesses and across the majority of the company’s Vascular Access non-BioFlo products are the primary reasons for the downside in overall revenues.No significant impact of currency has been observed in the reported quarter.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsPeripheral Vascular (PV) business: Sales at this segment totaled $51.4 million in the reported quarter, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Growth in the Fluid and Thrombus Management product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Angiographic Catheter businesses, as well as the persistent winding down of the company’s supply agreement with Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX  -  Free Report).Notably, AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space (catheter directed thrombolysis). The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.Vascular Access (VA) business: Sales at this segment were $22.6 million, down 4.2% from $23.6 million on a year-over-year basis. The segment witnessed solid sales in BioFlo related products. However, it was offset by declines in the remaining product lines within the segment.Oncology/Surgery business: AngioDynamics witnessed sales of $12.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from $11.8 million on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by additional sales of the recently launched Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation System.Margin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 49.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, from 50.6% in the year–ago quarter. The decline in gross margin was primarily because of an inventory write-off related to VOLTA, the company’s radio frequency ablation product, that was previously sold in Japan.Adjusted EBITDAS in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $13.3 million compared with $15.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Financial ConditionAngioDynamics had a strong cash flow balance in the second quarter. Per management, the company generated $10.2 million in operating cash flow and $9.4 million in free cash flow.Additionally, AngioDynamics ended the quarter with $51.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and debt of $95 million.FY18 View Lacks LusterAngioDynamics reduced its guidance for fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, the company expects net sales in the range of $345-$350 million compared with the previous range of $352-$359 million.Free cash flow is expected in the range of $30-$35 million.However, the company has reaffirmed previously announced adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 64-68 cents, excluding any impact from the recently legislated 2017 Tax Reform Act.Our TakeAngioDynamics reported a dismal second quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company also reiterated guidance for fiscal 2018. AngioDynamicis rides on the market’s solid response to Solero, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. Per management, AngioDynamics’ consistent focus on financial discipline and building a high-quality capital structure will boost investments toward innovative product portfolio and pursue strategic acquisitions.On the flipside, a drop in the core Angiographic Catheter business has affected the Peripheral Vascular Business segment. The company also has a high outstanding debt level. Higher debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions which might limit the execution of the company’s core business strategies.Price PerformanceAngioDynamics has been performing below the industry. Over the last 6 months, the stock has lost 0.8% against the industry’s gain of 7.8%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAngioDynamics holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ABIOMED Inc.

628,ABMD,"After months of discussions, House Republicans has finally passed the much-controversial $1.5-trillion tax-reform bill by a vote of 227 to 205 on Nov 16. The members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 to approve their version of the tax package on Nov 16. This paves the way for the full Senate to hold a debate on the bill once the session resumes post-Thanksgiving. However, Republicans are going to make every effort to get the bill signed by President Trump before Christmas.Overwhelmed with the House victory, Trump said before a cabinet meeting that, “We’re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas — hopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present.”Meanwhile, investors keen on the MedTech space are closely following the developments with the hope that the final tax stature may result in the abolition of the infamous MedTech tax. Before delving deeper into that, let us take a look at the primary objectives of the bills.A Brief on the House and Senate BillsAs per an article by Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport, published in The New York Times, the House bill proposes a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20% from 35%. It also shrinks the number of tax brackets from seven to four. Alongside, the bill intends to introduce an international tax system for the nation, more consistent with the tax structure of the rest of the world.It might also revoke or scale back many well-accepted deductions, including one for state and local taxes. The bill also focuses on doubling the standard deduction claimed by most tax payers. At the same time, it roots for the lifting of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1600. Simultaneously, it calls for complete eradication of the estate tax and allowance of roughly $10,000 in property tax deduction.Meanwhile, the Senate Bill raises the child tax credit to $2,000. It also cuts the top marginal tax rate from 39.6% to 38.5%. Also, the tax cuts for individuals are supposed to expire by the end of 2025. At the same time, the plan does not propagate a complete repeal of estate taxes. In fact, it calls for the abolishment of the Individual Mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under which majority of the people will be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty.Considering the differences in the bills, it is a challenging task for the Republicans to come to a neutral ground and decide on the final structure.Tax Reform Bills: Boon or Bane for MedTech?According to a Business Insider report, the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. This will affect families with high healthcare expenditure as these expenses will not be deducted from their taxes. Hence, most people will refrain from opting for expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures.  A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Rico’s gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover following the approval of the bill.While the reduction in corporate taxes will lead to extensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its effectiveness looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare expenses, the industry is likely to witness a shrink in customer base post-enactment, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.No matter how the policy shapes up, it will prove beneficial to some and challenging to other players in the MedTech space. Meanwhile, it’s best for investors to stay on the sidelines until the tax situation stabilizes.Bills Mum on Medical Device Tax RepealThe community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. This dreaded tax, which was commonly addressed as ‘fund of the ACA’, dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013. This tax is imposed on the selling price instead of net profit, amounting to a stupendous sum, wiping out almost a quarter of the profit for medical technology companies.Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015. Thus, the reimposition of the tax on Jan 1, 2018 is much feared by medical device stalwarts.A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) made a payment of $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Covidien and Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report) shelled out $112 million, $60 million and $25 million, respectively, in that year.  The situation for smaller companies has been much worse.In this context, ABIOMED, Inc.’s (ABMD  -  Free Report) CEO Michael Minogue quote (in an article by Cheryl Swanson published by The Motley Fool) is quite pertinent. He stated ""I don't think taxing the innovators and taxing the group of companies that provide innovation for healthcare is a smart idea, but the biggest concern I have, and what's unprecedented, is to tax companies that are not yet profitable, and in our industry where 70% of the companies are not yet profitable, this is going to have detrimental effects in their job growth, in their survival.""  Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in around an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax will lead to a $15-billion rise in taxes in 2018, largely discouraging R&D activities.Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans’ decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

634,ABMD,"ABIOMED Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), a leading medical product developer, is focusing heavily on its proprietary Impella Platform to drive customer base.We believe that robust demand for the Danvers, MA-based company’s Impella product line will continue to drive the top line in the long term. Impella is a percutaneously inserted ventricular assist device that has been increasingly used in patients with severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock and high-risk percutaneous intervention (PCI).ABIOMED will continue to leverage on the growing number of patients suffering from coronary heart diseases in the United States. Meanwhile, Impella revenues grew a strong 30% globally to $127.2 million in the last quarter.Performance is expected to remain bright on account of the company's penetration into both the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market. This is also evident from the fact that both Impella 2.5 and CP continue to add centers in the United Sates. At the end of the last reported quarter, the installed base for Impella 2.5 heart pumps in grew by 16 hospitals, taking the installed customer base total to 1,154 sites. The installed customer base for Impella CP heart pumps grew by 46 hospitals, reaching a total of 1062. The company also announced the successful launch of the Abiomed Impella Quality Program to improve clinical outcomes. Also, cost-savings efforts remain encouraging.The company recently announced the release of a new study on Circulation Research (a bi-weekly medical journal) that demonstrates the efficiency of Impella heart pump device in reducing the risk of acute kidney injury during high-risk PCI. New publications regarding the devices in leading medical journals help promote their utilization and effectiveness.Although ABIOMED‘s significant international presence broadens customer base among other positives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales. With Europe as a strong base for the company’s growing business opportunities, sluggishness in the European economy is likely to mar revenues and earnings.Of the other major headwinds, ABIOMED is likely to face increasing pricing pressure due to growing competition in its key markets from players like Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report), Cogentix Medical Inc  and EnteroMedics Inc . We expect this to hurt margins in the near term. Moreover, continued investments will drag  profitability.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Adjusted revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $424.2 million. Without the adjustments, Allscripts reported revenues of $426.1 million, which also outpaced our estimates.The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Quarter DetailsKey Highlights: Solid growth in U.S. Core Solutions and Services, fueled by Sunrise electronic health record (EHR) platform and Allscripts Revenue Cycle Management Services buoyed optimism in the second quarter. Furthermore, increased demand for CareInMotion solution in the health plan market and multiple global clients across the U.K. and the Asia-Pacific region drove revenues.

Margins contracted 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Software gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 260 bps on a year-over-year basis. However, Client service margins in the second quarter increased almost 410 bps to 18% of revenues, compared to 13.9% for the same period last year. Margin expansion was on the back of gains in efficiencies and scale within the company’s managed services business.Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter totaled $141 million, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase.GuidanceFor full-year 2017, the company expects revenues between $1.79 billion and $1.82 billion, up from the previously issued range of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion.  Adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow in the band of 10% to 15%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the band of $345 million and $365 million.For 2018 to 2020, Allscripts raised its adjusted revenue growth guidance.

The deal is worth $185 million in cash.Our TakeAllscripts exited the second quarter on a favorable note, wherein adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same. A solid guidance for full-year 2017 and a strong long-term outlook are the key highlights of the moment. Allscripts announced plans to takeover the hospital and health system business of McKesson Corporation, which is expected to close by the fourth quarter. Allscripts’ continued reliance on mergers and acquisition activities poses substantial integration risks. Furthermore, intensifying competition is a major dampener. The company’s products have a long sales cycle which involves intensive decision-making at different managerial levels. Adding to the woes, the company expects a modest increase in operating expense during the second half of the year to support business growth.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and Abiomed Inc.

Net income attributable to shareholders of the company is likely to increase around 7–9%.Our TakeFresenius Medical Care ended the second quarter on a mixed note wherein adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same. The company reiterated its full-year guidance. We believe this is in tune with the company’s long-term objective, or the ‘Growth Strategy 2020’, where it aims to increase revenues to $28 billion by 2020, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of around 10%. A wide range of dialysis products, initiatives to attaining market traction, solid international foothold, strategic acquisitions and divestments are major catalysts for the company.However, a tough regulatory environment, difficulties in boosting the profit margin in foreign legal-paradigms and competition in the niche markets are major headwinds.Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Abiomed Inc.

This is evident from the fact that both Impella 2.5 and CP continue to add centers in the U.S. New publications regarding the devices in leading medical journals help in promoting their utilization and effectiveness.Although Abiomed’s significant international presence helps broaden its customer base among other positives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales.

648,ABMD,"A company with strong profitability is able to meet all its business-related costs and expenses and still provide satisfactory returns to its investors. Although a fundamentally weak profitable company may face certain problems, recent studies indicate that a company with a high profitability level is a great investment choice.Here, we have used ratio analysis to evaluate the profitability of a company. There are four vital profitability ratios, which include gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. From these, we have selected net income ratio, which is the most widely used and transparent profitability ratio.Net Income RatioNet income ratio gives us the exact profitability level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total revenue. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company’s ability to meet operating and non-operating expenses.

649,ABMD,"Illinois-based global medical device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Leveraged on Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre glucose sensing technology, the collaboration will result in innovation and marketing of insulin delivery systems.The alliance will help the companies develop patient-friendly insulin delivery systems with no calibration glucose sensor. Per management, an important trial on the combined technological systems is projected to initiate in 2018 at clinical research sites across the U.S.Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 20.2% in first-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the Canadian development, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to value $30.25 billion by 2021 witnessing a CAGR of 5.93%.

However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results.
