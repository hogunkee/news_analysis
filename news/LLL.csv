2,LLL,"The Air Force announced Friday that it's moving forward with Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine and the Sierra Nevada/Embraer (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano as part of its experiments with light attack planes.X The idea is to test the combat effectiveness of less costly planes in uncontested space. That way, the Pentagon can reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses by sparing them from more routine missions.The Air Force hasn't decided if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022.The decision to narrow down to two aircraft came after the Air Force conducted an experiment with the AT-6, A-29, Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) last summer.In the next experiment, scheduled to run from May to July this summer, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and future interoperability tests on the AT-6 and A-29. But it will take place at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, instead of in a combat zone as initially expected.After the experiment, the Air Force expects to have the information it needs to potentially buy light attack aircraft in a future competition, without conducting a combat demonstration.Textron shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today. Embraer rose 3.1% on news that it may form a commercial jet joint venture with Boeing (BA).IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The AT-6 Wolverine can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and is also capable of carrying out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It's based on the Texan II trainer plane already in use by the Air Force.The A-29 Super Tucano is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The plane can carry munitions from rockets to air-to-air missiles to laser-guided bombs.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Watch The Aircraft In The Air Force's Light-Attack ExperimentDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

3,LLL,"Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and General Dynamics (GD) are showing signs of strength in an overall weak market as Pentagon spending ramps up and foreign demand for U.S. weapons remains high.The stock market rally is under pressure, with the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones falling toward their 200-day moving averages. So now is not the time for buying new stocks, but defense contractors are worth a look for your watch list. The fiscal 2018 federal budget includes $654.6 billion for the Pentagon, an increase of $61.1 billion from the fiscal 2017 budget.Relative strength lines, which track a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, for Raytheon, Northrop and General Dynamics all hit new highs Friday as shares rose 2.6%, 2% and 0.2%, respectively, while the broader market retreated sharply.Raytheon shares rose 1.5% on the stock market today, while Northrop climbed 2.7%.

The RS lines for Lockheed Martin (LMT), the maker of the F-35; L-3 Technologies (LLL), a developer of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems; and Huntington Ingalls (HII), a shipbuilder, are close to highs.Lockheed Martin stock was up 2.3% Monday, retaking its 50-day line. Flir, L-3 and Huntington Ingalls rallied about 3%.Boeing (BA), which makes nuclear missiles, satellites, the F/A-18 Super Hornet and other aircraft for the Pentagon, is a big winner in the defense budget. But its RS line is still lagging amid fears of a trade war with China, which could hurt the aerospace giant's commercial jet business. Boeing shares are losing sight of their 50-day moving average after breaking through that support line earlier this month.Boeing shares jumped 2.5% Monday amid reports that the U.S. and China are in talks to avert U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Boeing also is a likely winner of a big jet order from American Airlines (AAL).In addition to the federal budget just signed into law Friday, defense stocks are also seeing a tailwind from overseas demand.Saudi Arabia in particular has been a steady buyer of U.S. weapons, and late Thursday received the State Department's approval to buy 6,700 Raytheon anti-tank missiles.That followed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington, where he met with President Trump at the White House as well as with executives from Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed, and General Dynamics.A more hawkish White House staff could further facilitate such deals, which also need congressional approval.Just this past week, Trump ousted Lt.

4,LLL,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — The Air Force could use a light-attack plane in the fight against the Islamic State, but only after air superiority is assured, a top Air Force commander said.  XAs the Air Force continues to buy stealthy Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s, it's also looking at a cheaper option of 300 light-attack aircraft to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.But Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command, said ""air superiority is job one — that affords you a lot of options.""Once air superiority is assured, then a light-attack aircraft can be used.""I think the light attack would be able to provide me a lot of options, particularly if you're able to move closer to the forward line of the troops, provide the persistence that this type of platform will provide,"" he said at the Air Force Association's annual conference Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Air Force conducted an experiment with four planes over the summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and evaluated Textron's (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine, the A-29 Super Tucano from Sierra Nevada Corp. and Embraer (ERJ), and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL).The service hasn't made a final decision if the experiment will become a future program.Lockheed shares weren't active yet in premarket trading on the stock market today.

5,LLL,"Analysts are bullish on top defense stocks Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raython (RTN), L3 Communications (LLL) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as military spending is expected to ramp up on growing tensions in Syria, Ukraine and the South China Sea.In a note Thursday, Baird analyst Peter Arment wrote that the U.S. defense budget will keep rising and contractor backlogs will get a boost from both domestic and foreign military sales.Weapons spending by the Pentagon was up 16% in fiscal year 2016 and Arment expects spending to rise at least 5% in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and will ""remain a tailwind for contractor backlogs.""Raytheon was started with an outperform rating and 170 price target by Baird. Arment wrote that the company ""was highly levered to key areas such as missile defense and prevision weaponry."" But Raytheon's sales are more dependent than peers on international sales, and lower oil prices could put pressure on weapons sales from the Middle East.Northrop, which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, was started with an outperform rating and a 260 price target as production on the stealth fighter ramps up and development of the B-21 bomber continues. But like Raytheon, Northrop also faces uncertainty from foreign buyers.Raytheon shares rose 1.12 to 138.25 on the stock market today and is consolidating in a flat base as it tries to retake its 50-day line. Northrop shares rose 1.73 to 214.21, finding resistance at the 50-day line over the last several sessions. It's also forming a base.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing, Lockheed, and others are vying for helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Baird included Raytheon and Northrop in its list of top defense picks, along with L3 Communications, which makes intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.Baird rated L3 outperform and gave it a 184 price target, saying much of its sales are tied to a growing budget for classified programs.Lockheed was also initiated with an outperform rating and a 285 price target. But the prime contractor on the F-35 didn't make the top picks list, and Arment warned that pension issues could weigh on the stock.L3 shares, which broke out of a cup base in May, edged up 2.09 to 152.54 Thursday, nearing profit-taking sell territory for those who bought at the May breakout. Lockheed dipped 1.88 to 234.72, hitting a five-month low and threatening to undercut its 200-day moving average for the first time since February.RELATED:Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid DealGermany Buys Lockheed C-130 As Airbus A400 Delays Continue Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid Deal

Apple (AAPL), the largest weighting on the composite, tumbled more than 2% but trimmed its loss. Shares are holding above the 110.33 buy point of the Sept. 14 breakout. The company had a mixed quarterly report late Tuesday.The S&P 500 was off 0.1% and the Dow was up 0.3% thanks largely to Boeing's (BA) 4% surge on a solid earnings report. In fact, other defense stocks were strong, and it wasn't just the big moves in Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC).

In the medical services group, Laboratory Corp. of America (LH) plummeted 8% in heavy trading after the provider of clinical testing services missed Q3 profit estimates.Several restaurants were among the stocks being sold in unusually heavy volume. Panera Bread (PNRA) reversed lower, hitting resistance at the 50-day moving average. The stock was up early on the company's Q3 results. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and GrubHub (GRUB) also were down sharply following quarterly reports.Despite general market weakness, a couple of high-rated stocks broke out of bases.Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) broke out of a cup-with-handle pattern with a 17.18 buy point.

8,LLL,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane and a longer version of its 737 Max, as the aerospace giant seeks to counter gains from Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Management said on a conference call that a new mid-market plane could be delivered in the 2024-2025 timeframe, while a stretched 737 Max could be ready by the end of the decade.Boeing has been mulling a new midsize plane or a longer 737 to fill the gap created by 757 production stopped, but hasn't said before it would do both. The latest comments come as the company has had to lay off employees due in part to Airbus gaining market share, as the A321neo has helped airlines open up new routes.Boeing also said the production rate on the current-generation 777 likely won't go down by more than 1-2 planes a month, adding that it would take ""offsetting actions"" to limit the impact on margins of any further rate cuts.Sales of the 777 have been slowing as customers prefer to wait for the upcoming next-generation 777X, but the company is trying to maintain a certain level of current-generation 777 production to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X on its assembly lines.Boeing shares jumped 4.7% to close at 145.54 on the stock market today, clearing a 139.55 buy point from a flat base and hitting the highest level of the year. Aerospace supplier TransDigm (TDG) rose 1.1% to 271.08, topping a 269.31 entry point.
"
9,LLL,"IBD's TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. Boeing's core Q3 EPS rose 11.5% to $2.81, excluding a 70-cent per-share tax benefit, above views for $2.60. Revenue fell 8% to $23.9 billion but topped forecasts for $23.64 billion. Revenue from its commercial airplanes division fell 4% to $16.97 billion on lower planned delivery volume. Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries. Defense revenue fell 10% to $7.5 billion on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume.During the quarter, the Air Force signed two contracts with Boeing for a total value of $2.8 billion to make 19 KC-46 tankers. Boeing had taken a charge on the tanker in the last two quarters amid repeated delays and cost overruns.Boeing now plans to deliver 745 to 750 commercial airplanes this year, up from its prior outlook of 740 to 745 planes. It also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $6.80-$7 from an earlier outlook of $6.10-$6.30, but that just adds the 70-cent per-share tax benefit. Analysts see $6.34.Boeing's European rival Airbus reported a 21% drop in quarterly earnings Wednesday, falling short of analyst views due to supplier issues with its A350. Airbus's U.S.-traded shares climbed 3.4% to 15.02.But the company said problems with engines that it uses from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney are ""largely over."" United Tech shares dipped 0.4% to 101.01.""For the remaining months of the year we remain totally focused on deliveries to achieve our earnings and cash guidance,"" CEO Tom Enders said in a release.Airbus said it would deliver over 208 planes by the end of the year, and deliveries of the A350 will nearly double.At its helicopter unit, Airbus saw a slowdown in commercial sales.In a positive day for defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) broke out of a flat base, gapping above the 224.22 buy point. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance Wednesday after reporting third-quarter results above analyst expectations.Other big gainers in the group included Flir Systems (FLIR), which shot up 10%, and TransDigm Group (TDG), which broke out past the 269.41 buy point of a flat base. Earnings reports were the catalysts for Boeing and Flir Systems.

10,LLL,"ARLINGTON, Va. —  Light attack aircraft that are less expensive to buy and operate than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) cutting-edge F-35 or older fighters like Boeing's (BA) F-15 could help the U.S. attract new allies, a top Air Force officer said Monday.XThe Air Force is weighing whether light attack aircraft should become part of the U.S. fleet as well, and just began a second phase of experiments to compare Textron's (TXT) AT-6 Wolverine against the Sierra Nevada/Embraer (ERJ) A-29 Super Tucano.The A-29, which at $10 million each costs about a tenth of Lockheed's F-35, is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The prospect of sharing an aircraft with the U.S. could be an incentive for countries to increase U.S. ties more broadly.""Lower that cost so we gain new allies with that light attack approach,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements, at a Mitchell Institute event. ""Not every country can afford an F-35 or even an F-15 or F-16. Partner with other countries that haven't been able to do so at this point.""Textron shares closed up 1.4% at 63.88 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last month. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares dipped 0.9%, Lockheed rallied 2%, and Boeing rose 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Air Force hasn't decided yet if the experiment will become an official acquisition program, but Congress is open to the purchase of up to 300 light-attack aircraft by 2022. Harris also sounded eager to speed up the process.""We are doing our best to minimize new development and just take existing things on the shelf so we can speed the acquisition to get this in the fight sooner,"" he said.In a series of experiments that started today at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, the Air Force will perform logistics, maintenance, weapons and interoperability tests. The experiments could also include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tests, Harris said.In the first phase of light attack experiments, which took place in August 2017, the Air Force looked at Textron's Scorpion and the AT-802L Longsword from L3 Technologies (LLL) in addition to the AT-6 and A-29. The four planes flew in both day and night tests, with and without weapons.The idea behind light attack aircraft is to save money by using them for more routine missions in low-risk environments, and deploy top-of-the-line, fifth-generation aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters for missions in more dangerous environments.Operating a propeller plane like the Super Tucano, for example, would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.""The price-per-kill today using precision weapons aboard fifth-gen fighters is exorbitant, "" Harris said. ""And we've been paying that price for decades.""Editor's note: this story has been updated to corrected the location of the second-phase experiments.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsF-35 Prepares For Combat Tests That May Unleash Lockheed Growth

11,LLL,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense stocks fell Tuesday, as the sector continues a sell-off that began last week.XLockheed's shares also tumbled last week, after the F-35 maker failed to raise its cash flow guidance when it reported first-quarter results. That weighed on hopes for bigger dividends while the 10-year Treasury yield topped 3% for the first time since 2014, making dividend-paying stocks are less attractive relative to debt.On Tuesday the two-year yield rose as high as 2.52%, the highest since the month before Lehman Bros. went bankrupt before pulling back 2.50%. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield climbed to 2.96%.Defense stocks had been setting up bases and nearing buy range heading into earnings last week, but now those bases have been wiped out.Lockheed shares tumbled 3.9% to close at 308.46 on the stock market today, despite receiving a $1.4 billion contract late Monday from the Pentagon and international customers for F-35 sustainment.But Edward Jones reiterated its buy rating on Lockheed in a note late Tuesday, saying geopolitical tensions remain high while militaries still need to modernize.Defense stocks such as Lockheed have likely fallen recently because values were historically high, and earnings ""were not pristine enough for investors,"" Edward Jones added. Additionally, there could be a reaction to the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Northrop fell 4.6% to its lowest since January. While the defense contractor's Q1 results beat Wall Street estimates last week, it didn't raise its cash flow guidance and said it dropped out of the running for the Air Force's GPS 3 satellites contract.Surveillance equipment developer L-3 Technologies (LLL) sank 4.5% to the lowest since November, and shipbuilder Huntinton Ingalls (HII) lost 3.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

14,LLL,"Tesla kept charging higher and continued to work on its new base, while software companies also helped sustain the Nasdaq composite's leadership in stocks today. Meanwhile, the market presents at least four new reasons why investors should stay bullish on growth stocks.The tech-rich Nasdaq composite gained more than 0.5%.At that level, the premier index for growth stocks has now climbed 509% from its March 2009 low of 1265.The S&P 500, hampered by sell-offs in the ship transport, meat, oil drilling, mortgage services, and aerospace and defense industries, was mostly flat after rising nearly 0.3% intraday. The Dow Jones industrial average edged about 0.2% lower. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time on Monday on both main exchanges.Kirby (KEX), part of IBD's fourth-ranked Transport-Ship industry group, sailed sharply lower. Shares dropped as much as 4.7% to an intraday low of 86.05 and undercut the key 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a seven-week flat base at 81 in April.The stock is a member of the IBD Leaderboard stock-picking service and one of two Leaders list stocks that are linked to the oil and gas industry.

The U.S. central bank has been raising rates since December 2015, when the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%.Tesla (TSLA), as noted in this recent Stock Market Today column, is still fashioning the right side of a brand-new base. However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk announced a 9% cut in total staff, centered on salaried employees. A company memo to employees said that no production associates got laid off.The company seeks to get profitable while also meeting the tremendous demand for its entry-level all-electric car. The planned staff cuts should reduce total headcount to 37,000.Tesla shares show a terrible Relative Price Strength Rating of 25 on a scale of 1 to 99. But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic.

15,LLL,"Defense contractors hanging tough in the stock market correction are your stocks to watch this week. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and L3 Technologies (LLL) have relative strength lines that are at or near highs. Our spotlight on military contractors comes as President Trump on Friday signed a two-year budget bill that will provide the military an additional $165 billion in defense spending.X It's important to stress that in the current stock market correction, these are names to watch for future set-ups, not to buy right now. Stocks that hold up well during a downturn may form new bases and be among the first to break out in a new market uptrend.But if the technicals begin to falter, investors should drop them from their watch lists.The relative strength line is the blue line on the charts below, separate from price action. The RS line shows a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Measuring a stock's relative strength is helpful when separating strong stocks from weak ones. An RS line at an all-time high is especially positive.Boeing is primarily a civilian aircraft maker, but it's still a major defense contractor as well. Shares have hit some turbulence amid the broad selloff, but the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart is holding somewhat near its recent peak. The RS  line hit a new all-time high on Feb. 7, even though the major indexes reversed to close the session lower.Boeing shares rose 3.3% as the major averages rose more than 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With the stock market in a correction, this is not time to start making new buys. But rather than step away completely, it's more important than ever for investors to stay in step with the market. For our latest market analysis, be sure to read The Big Picture.Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense contractor, was able to find support at the 50-day line early this past week. The RS line is holding at a high, even with shares reversing lower for a second trading session.Lockheed shares advanced 1.3%.Military contractors Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have relative strength lines that are continuing to hit new highs as well, and they too were able to find support at the 50-day line this past week.Raytheon and Northrup shares climbed 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively, on Monday.L3 Technologies is the only defense contractor stock here that is currently testing support at its 50-day line. With the S&P 500 index rebounding from its 200-day line on Friday, leading a broad stock market bounce, L3 closed the week just above its 50-day.

19,LLL,"A positive reaction in the stock market greeted CACI (CACI) after the company announced that it indeed had agreed to buy L-3 Communications ' (LLL) National Security Solutions for $550 million.Analysts had expected both the deal and the price. On Monday, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a research note that the deal should be ""solidly cash-flow accretive."" Reuters had reported the possible deal on Friday.In its announcement early Tuesday, government-focused tech services provider CACI International said its revenue would rise by about $1 billion a year. That's about a 30% increase from CACI's current $3.3 billion revenue run rate.CACI shares rallied near a new high Tuesday, near 103 and not far from their all-time high of 104.09 touched on Dec. 1. L-3 stock, though, fell moderately as it forecast that its overall revenue would fall by a slightly greater percentage in 2016 without National Security Solutions (NSS).In its press release, CACI called NSS ""a prime mission partner"" to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and civilian federal government, which are also among CACI's customers. CACI expects the deal to close in the March quarter.Based in Reston, Va., 17 miles from CACI's Arlington headquarters, NSS ""provides highly specialized and differentiated strategic solutions, services and products for the country's most sensitive national security agencies and DoD-critical missions,"" CACI said.NSS employs about 4,000, about 90% of whom carry security clearances.CACI said it will use term and revolving debt to finance the deal.""Even if CACI ... finances the deal with debt at a 5%-6% rate, it should be solidly cash flow-accretive,"" Cowen's von Rumohr said on Monday
"
20,LLL,"The prospective buyer fell and possible seller rose Monday, in the first trading morning after word spread that CACI International (CACI) may purchase the National Security Solutions unit from L-3 Communications (LLL) for about $550 million.Cowen analysts immediately tagged the prospective deal as ""neutral/positive"" for CACI investors as ""it looks like it would be cash-flow-accretive.""But early in the stock market today, CACI stock was down nearly 2% to under 100, about 4% off its recent 52-week high, while L-3 Communications stock was trading up 1% to around 125, about 6% off its high set in February.Cowen maintains a ""market perform"" rating with a 98 price target on CACI.""The Reuters story that CACI is near a deal to buy NSS for $550 million is plausible since (1) LLL indicated last week that it hopes to close a deal by year-end, (2) CACI has been the most acquisition-minded of the public defense IT service companies, and (3) it would be convenient for LLL to be able to factor (the) impact of a deal into its 2016 EPS guide at its investor day this coming Tuesday,"" Cowen analysts Cai von Rumohr wrote in a research note Monday.""A price of $550 million would work out to 8.9x estimated 2016 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $62 million. Because CACI has (a last-12-month) net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.2x at 9-30-15, purchase of NSS for $550 million would boost its net debt/EBITDA to 4.1x and might boost CACI's borrowing costs.""However, even if CACI buys NSS and finances the deal with debt at a 5%-6% rate, it should be solidly cash flow-accretive,"" the analyst wrote. ""But a possible deal's impact on EPS would depend on the size of intangibles associated with the transaction.""Executives of CACI could not be reached for comment Monday morning. An L-3 executive said the company can't comment now, but may ""at an appropriate time.""Citing sources familiar with the deal, Reuters reported Friday afternoon that negotiations were ""exclusive"" and a deal may be announced this week, ""assuming negotiations are concluded successfully.""L-3 describes its National Security Solutions as its ""cyber business ... focused on defending networks and equipment against increasingly sophisticated attacks and applying forensics to deter cyberspace breaches. We support our military and government customers with a full spectrum of information technology expertise in designing global networks, cloud security architectures and complex computing solutions.""A small-cap member of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, CACI earns a 79 Composite Rating, meaning its stock is performing better than 79% of other publicly traded issues by a variety of metrics, such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. While sales have fallen by single-digit percentages in 11 of the last 12 quarters, CACI did grow revenue 1% year over year to $822.4 million in the last quarter, with earnings up 2% to $1.84 minus items. In the current quarter ending this month, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS to rise 14% from a year ago to $1.15.L-3 earnings have been choppy, falling in six of the last 12 quarters and rising 15% in the last one. But analysts expect the current quarter ending this month to yield earnings down 24% to 1.93 per share on revenue of $3.12 billion, down 2.6% from a year earlier. It's part of IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry group and carries a 68 Composite Rating. With a $10 billion market cap, its the 12th largest in its group that's led in size by Boeing (BA) (which has a high Composite rating of 92) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).

32,LLL,"As the multibillion-dollar market for military and commercial drones gains traction, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are just two firms that could benefit from the State Department's newly announced policy on expanding drone exports to allies.On Tuesday, the Obama administration established new standards for the global export of the unmanned devices that include strict sale conditions and ""end-use assurances"" from recipient nations.The new policy, which prohibits the use of American drones for ""unlawful surveillance,"" opens the door to U.S. drone and arms manufacturers looking to make sales abroad.According to Reuters, the U.S. has sold armed drones to the U.K., while unarmed U.S. military drones have been sold to countries like France and Italy. The State Department will now review requests for armed drones from Italy and Turkey.Lockheed could notably stand to gain from increased drone exports: the General Atomics' Predator and Reaper drones use Lockheed missiles.The State Department's decision could also boost makers of drone components.""Additional sales of Reapers to international users would benefit Raytheon, maker of the MTS-B multispectral targeting sensor, and L-3 Communications (LLL), which provides satellite communications components and training simulators,"" said Guggenheim Partners' Roman Schweizer in a note. ""Honeywell (HON) supplies turboprop engines and guidance components.""Lockheed shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today.

41,LLL,"The Pentagon is drafting its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 — the first that will fully show the Trump administration's vision for military spending — and events in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. Navy may weigh on the White House's priorities for defense dollars.""The 2017 and 2018 budgets were mostly about just trying to recover some readiness, they didn't look at sustainment and new investment and capabilities,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.President Trump is reportedly going to announce the deployment of 4,000 more troops as part of his long-awaited plan for Afghanistan when he address the nation tonight at 9 p.m. ET.Hunter said that isn't a major increase, so defense contractors in Afghanistan are unlikely to see a big spike in business. But the troop buildup also means Trump won't withdraw U.S. troops and produce a huge negative for companies.""If Trump had decided to scale back U.S. commitment and withdrawal, those engaged with Afghan security forces couldn't stay there,"" Hunter told IBD.Makers of ground vehicles, like General Dynamics (GD), could get a boost — as well as the companies that help maintain vehicles for the Afghan military.Sales of the low-cost A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions, could also get a boost, Hunter added.The plane's performance in Afghanistan could have implications for the U.S. arsenal too. The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 low-cost attack aircraft by 2022, to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The Super Tucano, made jointly by privately held Sierra Nevada and Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), is participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment with light-attack aircraft, along with the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).U.S. and South Korea forces will conduct previously scheduled joint military exercises this week despite pressure from North Korea and China to cancel the event.The war games could prompt North Korea to ratchet up pressure again, after pulling back from its threats to launch missiles toward Guam.Hunter said missile defense spending would have to increase to meet the short-term demands of more intercepts in addition to longer-term R&D, noting that the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo last week that put missile defense at the top of its R&D priorities list.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is currently deployed outside Seoul, and Boeing (BA) is the prime on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system used to protect the U.S.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works Late Sunday, the USS John S. McCain guided-missile destroyer build by Huntington Ingalls Industries' (HII) Bath Iron Works, collided with an oil tanker east of the busy Malacca Strait. Ten sailors are currently missingThe ship is one of 14 equipped with Lockheed's ship-based Aegis missile defense system, forward-deployed as tensions increase with North Korea.This is the second accident for the Navy's 7th Fleet in the last two months, as seven sailors on the USS Fitzgerald were killed in an accident off the coast of Japan in June.The latest collision could raise questions about the Navy's readiness, potentially leading to a re-emphasis on training in the budget.Shares of Lockheed were up 0.5% on the stock market today, Boeing dipped 0.4%, Raytheon lost 0.1%, General Dynamics eased 0.1%, Textron dropped 0.3%, and Embraer fell 0.1%.RELATED: Watch The Army's Stryker Fire Its New Anti-Russia WeaponsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

42,LLL,"The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 cheap light-attack aircraft by 2022 to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The service is conducting tests this month at the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, looking at the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine, the A-29 Super Tucano from Sierra Nevada Corp. and Embraer (ERJ), and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).Lockheed Martin (LMT)  deemed its T-50A, its offering for the trainer competition, too high tech for the light-attack experiment.The Scorpion jet costs $20 million per unit and $3,000 per flight hour. In comparison, the aging A-10 costs over $17,000 per flight hour.The Scorpion can carry more weapons than its competitors and could be used for everything from close air support to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), according to Textron. But while the plane first flew in 2013, it still doesn't have its first customer and Textron withdrew the plane from the Air Force's T-X trainer competition.The turboprop has familiarity on its side as it's based off the Texan II trainer already in use by the Air Force. The AT-6 can carry conventional and laser-guided bombs and be used for precision attack and ISR missions.The turbo prop costs $10 million to $14 million depending on the configuration, with a per-flight-hour cost of around $500.  The Super Tucano is already being used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterroism missions and is in service in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and six other countries. The plane can carry munitions from rockets to air-to-air missiles to laser-guided bombs.The plane failed to meet the experiment's requirements to have a pressurized cockpit and ejection seat but was still invited to attend.So far the planes have performed in both day and night tests and have flown with and without weapons.""That data is intended to inform strategic decisions,"" Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said to visiting reporters last week, according to Defense News. ""It will also tell us whether we take this to the next step.""A next step might mean a mission in a real combat zone, such as Iraq, to test the planes' attack and ISR capabilities and ability to land on primitive forward runways  in a permissive environment.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksWhy This Cold War-Era Spy Legend Could Last More Than 100 Years

"
44,LLL,"Defense contractors and investors are celebrating Donald Trump's plan to boost weapons spending, but Pentagon budgeting experts say he's counting on savings that won't come true -- the old Washington saw of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.""It's a fantasy,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the president-elect's campaign pledge to finance a more robust military partly by slashing bureaucracy and duplication at the Pentagon. Eaglen has briefed Trump's advisers.""I tried several times to disabuse them of the notion that this could ever pay for even a fraction of Trump's buildup costs,"" she said.As a candidate, Trump called for defense initiatives that analysts such as Eaglen say would add $55 billion to $80 billion annually to a spending request that totals $583 billion this year. Trump envisions a Navy with dozens more ships than the service has sought and an Army as big as the one President George W. Bush sent into Iraq and Afghanistan for full-scale invasions.Encouraged by those prospects, the S&P Aerospace & Defense index climbed 3.9% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader S&P 500, to the highest level since 1989. It was led by Raytheon (RTN), L-3 Communications Holdings (LLL), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). The index climbed an additional 2% Thursday.Fulfilling campaign promises is only part of the defense spending challenge facing the new president.There's an immediate issue: delivering on Trump's pledge to remove caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act that would constrain Pentagon spending over the next four years. President Barack Obama, backed by Democratic lawmakers, has resisted eliminating the defense caps unless those on domestic spending are eased as well.Howard Rubel, a defense analyst with Jefferies Inc., said in a note that ""the election appears to embolden fiscal conservatives and military hawks. The prospects for eliminating"" the caps ""jumps substantially. The problem is that domestic safety net-type spending may suffer"" and ""addressing the deficit may be an afterthought.""The caps, which have been temporarily modified three times, are due to return in fiscal 2018, the first budget of the new administration. Through 2021, the caps would force about $106.6 billion in Pentagon cuts if no agreement is reached and the automatic cuts known as sequestration kick in, including about $33 billion in fiscal 2018.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is Trump's top defense adviser and is said to be a leading candidate for defense secretary, told Defense News last month that ""it is painful for me as a budget"" hawk ""to acknowledge that we can't stay at a sequester-like level. We are just not going to be able to do that.""Trump also faces pending weapons decisions such as whether to increase purchases of Lockheed's F-35, the Pentagon's costliest weapons system, to 70 in the fiscal 2018 budget from the 63 requested this year.And then there are long-term funding questions that require advanced planning, including how to cope with what the military calls a ""bow wave"" of spending after 2021. That includes the planned modernization of all three legs of the air-land-sea triad of nuclear arms, which Trump has endorsed.Trump's broad aspirations are clear. In April he said his ""administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.""Among his promises were to increase the Army to 540,000 soldiers from about 475,000 today, reversing Obama's downsizing that would reduce the force to 450,000 in the next fiscal year. Trump also has vowed to ""build a Navy approaching 350 surface ships and submarines,"" up from about 272 today and the service's goal of 308 ships.For now, at least, the familiar -- and elusive -- Washington refrain of cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse,"" as President Ronald Reagan put it in the 1980s, remains the centerpiece of Trump's financing plan.His campaign website site used a variation on the Reagan theme, saying he would ""pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.""Eaglen, who has worked for Republican lawmakers and served in the Pentagon under Bush, said those are goals that should always be pursued but ""cannot yield $55 to $60 billion per year in new money to reinvest -- period.""""Some of Trump's ideas for a larger Navy, etc. will take a lot more money up front than any reform agenda"" can generate, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. ""Unambiguously, what he wants to do will take more money,"" said O'Hanlon, author of ""The $650 Billion Bargain: The Case For Modest Growth in America's Defense Budget.""Other passages in the Trump campaign statement ""seem to indicate he would raise revenues or cut other parts of government to pay for defense,"" Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an e-mail. ""That is much more realistic, but the devil is in the details and no details are provided.""But ""the idea that auditing the Pentagon is going to uncover billions of dollars of waste is a myth,"" he said.Dov Zakheim, who was Pentagon comptroller under Bush, said that while an audit ""will not save money per se,"" it can focus attention on needless bureaucracy.""Some 70,000 positions have been added since 1990,"" Zakheim said. ""Has DoD become more efficient as a result? I don't think so.""
"
45,LLL,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and other defense stocks enjoyed a furious rally last week after the presidential election. Donald Trump had vowed to beef up military spending on the campaign trail, while lower corporate tax rates could also be a boon.Defense shares are holding steady or pulling back modestly in lighter volume. But that could offer new buying opportunities for investors. Keep in mind that new defense spending may not materialize. And if Pentagon spending does increase, that doesn't mean all defense firms, or stocks, will be winners.Lockheed Martin fell 7 cents to 263.28 on the stock market today after falling 1% to 263.35 Wednesday. Lockheed reversed from an all-time intraday high of 269.74 Tuesday.The defense giant, maker of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, closed at 267.24 on Monday, just above a 267.03 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. Such patterns can work, but the odds are less than cup bases with a handle. Handles offer an opportunity to shake out weak holders, so when the stock clears the pivot, big institutions have to bid up prices to get holders to part with their shares.Lockheed could be forming a handle, but that would need a few more days to develop. Until then, the 267.03 entry point holds.L3 Communications (LLL), like Lockheed, raced up to hit a buy point on Monday, though it didn't close above that 154.18 level. L3 fell 0.3% to 149.97 Thursday, its third straight modest decline. Like Lockheed, it could be working on a handle, but it's not ready yet.The maker of military communications and surveillance gear plunged 7.4% on Oct. 27 after its latest earnings report. Shares continued to slide to a low of 132.38 on Nov. 3, below the 200-day line. But L3 raced straight back up, spiking 12% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have been huge winners since the presidential election. They too are pulling back. But bank stock charts still look great.Raytheon fell 0.8% to 144.96, its third straight modest loss. It's still in buy range from a 143.49 entry point.Raytheon broke out on Nov. 9, after the presidential election, hitting a record 152.58 intraday before settling at a 7.5% gain to 146.71.Northrop Grumman dipped 0.3% to 244.66 Thursday after modest losses in the prior two sessions.Northrop broke past a 224.22 buy point on Oct. 27, following its earnings report. Shares then traded in a tight range before exploding following Trump's win, pushing the stock out of buy range. After a stock is more than 5% extended from the pivot, investors should avoid chasing it. But Northrop could pull back into range, which extends up to 235.43.General Dynamics edged down 0.1% to 165.63, its third straight modest decline. It's still slightly extended from buy range.General Dynamics gapped higher on Nov. 9, blasting above a 157.07 pivot from a short consolidation. The chase zone reaches to 164.92, so keep an eye on further pullbacks.Boeing (BA) fell 0.8% to 145.33, moving further into buying range after dipping barely into a proper entry zone on Wednesday. Boeing has a 139.55 buy point in a flat base, in range up to 146.53. Boeing cleared the entry point on Oct. 26 following Q3 earnings.Boeing remains focused mostly on civilian aircraft, but it's still a big Pentagon contractor.Here is a weekly chart:RELATED:Raytheon Launched Into Buy Range On Trump Win, Defense Stocks RallyLockheed, Northrop Price Targets HikedTrump Wants To Beef Up Military, But Funding Could Be The Enemy

47,LLL,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

Overall S&P 500 earnings are still in a downtrend, but the pace of decline is less than feared.The market is rewarding stocks like Apple, which is trading above 100 for the first time since late April. But fund investors aren't exactly piling in. Technology ETFs saw net outflow of $617 million in July -- a month that saw real estate exchange traded funds rake in $1.2 billion in fresh money, according to State Street Global Advisors.For Dave Mazza, head of research at State Street's SPDR ETFs, that's a telling sign of investor sentiment.""In an environment where growth is scarce, I would expect to see ETF investors walk into an area that's offering growth, but we're not seeing it,"" Mazza said. This earnings season came on the heels of the Brexit vote and in the middle of presidential conventions that drove investors' attention away from company fundamentals and more toward ""bigger-picture items,"" he noted.And the broad macroeconomic outlook is awash in uncertainties.""Volatility is here to stay as investors fret over the extended age of the current bull market, a lack of earnings growth, China, Europe, and perhaps most importantly, the most divisive U.S. presidential election in recent memory,"" State Street's recent 2016 Mid-Year ETF & Investment Outlook noted. Against that backdrop, the firm has some advice for ETF investors:Smart beta strategies are low-cost and offer broad market exposure, while zeroing in on ""factors"" -- or stock characteristics -- that can give portfolios an extra boost over time, according to State Street.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Quality Mix (QEMM) are ETFs that seek out promising factors for the current market scenario.SPHD looks for S&P 500 stocks showing low risk and high yield. It has jumped 20.4% year to date vs. a 7.1 gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a comparable ETF that gives you the broad U.S. market with no extra frills.Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global, says the industrial sector is -- against the odds -- leading Q2 earnings growth, with consumer discretionary. ""The aerospace and defense industry group dominates the upside surprises for industrials this quarter and even accounted for several guidance raises,"" Bell wrote on Wednesday. Boeing (BA) landed the biggest earnings beat in the group. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and L-3 Communications (LLL) have bumped up outlook.IBD'S TAKE: To find out which exchange traded funds investing in sectors and industry groups are the current stock market leaders, check out ETF Center.Aerospace is a pocket of strength within industrials, according to Bell. ""We expect that to continue as the remainder of 2016 plays out and believe any improvement, no matter how small, in the economic environment will be a tailwind for the group into the future."" Three ETFs target this niche, including iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA).Health care is another sector with stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings growth, making it worthy of a spot on ETF watch lists.Chuck Self, CIO of iSectors, whose popular tactical ETF-based strategy invests across nine sectors, is impressed with the latest earnings beats by chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Self told IBD he's ""going back in"" to technology with iShares North American Tech (IGM). Self also likes tech multinationals -- as well as gold miners -- as a weak dollar play.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) offers an efficient way to hold and trade the precious metal in a brokerage account.

51,LLL,"The stock market's rally heated up with an hour to go in Monday's session, the first trading day in May. Volume was running at a slower pace vs. Friday's intense pace.Both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 gained 0.7% to 0.8%, holding near the highs of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average trailed only slightly, up 0.6%. Yield plays outperformed, with the Dow Jones utility average at one point up more than 1.1%.Equally as important, the Nasdaq is finding support at the 50-day moving average, which has been rising for the past six weeks. In strong market uptrends, the major indexes tend to trade north of the 50- and 200-day moving averages, not south.In the stock market today, aerospace firms showed some muscle. L-3 Communications (LLL) gapped up on Monday and rose 1.4% to 133.42, just above a 131.46 buy point within a six-month, saucerlike base pattern. More aggressive traders could have entered the stock when it broke through upside resistance near 121 on April 18. At that time, the stock cleared a trend line that can be drawn from the price high on the left side of the saucer at 131.36.The buy zone runs up to 138.03, 5% above the proper 133.42 entry. Leading stocks should not be chased far beyond the proper buy zone, as temporary pullbacks could shake you out of the stock.

It marked the strongest quarter of EPS growth in at least five years. Revenue shrank for the 11th straight quarter, down 5% vs. a year ago to $2.35 billion.L-3 noted in a news release that all of its businesses contributed to higher operating profit margins. The company also sold its ""National Security Solutions"" business as part of a re-focus on ""higher margin, high-returning businesses,"" CEO Michael Strianese said.L-3 gets a 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, which is respectable in light of the company's attempts to turn around its earnings picture. Earnings fell 4% to $6.91 a share in 2015, but Wall Street sees a 12% pickup for full-year 2016 to $7.71 and an 11% rise in 2017 to $8.54.IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry subgroup, made up of 51 firms, ranks 88th among 197 groups and subgroups in terms of six-month relative price performance and is barely positive for the year.Heico (HEI), featured last week in IBD's New America column, has also formed a long saucer base with a fresh handle, offering a new 62.79 entry.

It marked Baidu's second year-over-year EPS decline in three quarters, while revenue growth slowed for a third quarter in a row. Revenue climbed 38%, 31% and 27% in the prior three periods.

71,LLL,"FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) launched Black Hornet 3 nano-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), targeting global militaries, government agencies and first responders. The next generation Black Hornet 3 nano-UAV is now powered with the ability to navigate in GPS-denied environments, allowing users to maintain awareness and surveillance as well as for threat detection.  The Black Hornet Personal Reconnaissance System (PRS) is already the world’s smallest combat-proven nano-Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), providing small combat units, SWAT teams and first responders with intelligence, target-acquisition and reconnaissance capability. The Black Hornet 3 now offers the lowest size, weight and heightened performance for UAS along with improved speed and distance.Last week, FLIR Systems secured a $2.6-million order from the U.S. Army’s Soldier Borne Sensor (SBS) program to deliver the Black Hornet in a first batch order. Recently, the company will deliver the Black Hornet 3 for the Royal Australian Army and French Armed Forces.Existing Business ScenarioFLIR Systems’ core strength in providing reliable and effective imaging as well as threat-detection technologies is expected to drive growth. Additionally, increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military to personal hand-held cameras and Smartphones, continues to fuel growth in this market. The company also remains extremely committed toward the introduction of innovative products to expand its customer base and strengthen foothold in new markets.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 20.4%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 8.7%.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s government and military business has been faring well over the past few quarters driven by its CDMQ model. Through this model, the company develops technology by investing in research & development and then equips it with military standards for sale to the government. Also, FLIR Systems has been able to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets using this model. Going ahead, the company expects CDMQ model to improve prospects of its business with the government, thereby adding to its strength.Despite these tailwinds, FLIR Systems’ gross margins are vulnerable to a host of factors, including product mix changes and manufacturing cost absorption. In addition, high manufacturing cost absorption is likely to restrict the company’s growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are AeroVironment, Inc (AVAV  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies Inc (LLL  -  Free Report) and CPI Aerostructures, Inc (CVU  -  Free Report).

72,LLL,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) recently clinched a modification contract for eight CH-47F new build helicopters, aiming to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (RSLFAC). The deal came under the foreign military sales (FMS) program. Boeing’s CH-47 Chinook is an advanced American twin-engine, multi-mission, heavy-lift helicopter used by the U.S. Army and other international defense forces.Details of the DealValued at $25.7 million, the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.Work related to this deal is scheduled to get completed by Jul 31, 2021 and will be carried out in Ridley Township, PA. The contract will use fiscal 2017 foreign military sales funds.FMS Share in Boeing’s PerformanceForeign Military Sales (FMS) are growing quickly as the U.S. industry's preferred method for selling defense systems abroad.  For companies that have a solid position as US Department of Defense providers but are new to exporting, FMS offers huge benefits in terms of logistic support. Working through FMS, inevitably, has numerous benefits, including reaching a broader customer base, reducing the risk inherent in international sales, facilitating planning and reducing the administrative burden of doing business internationally.In 2017, FMS contracts accounted for approximately 31% of the company's total revenues. Revenues including foreign military sales through the U.S. government were 27% and 23% of consolidated revenues for 2015 and 2016, respectively. Given its strong order bookings overseas, Boeing expects to increase the company’s FMS share in total revenues going forward for 2018 as well.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Its defense segment — Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) — witnessed a 13% year-over-year increase in first-quarter 2018 revenues to $5.76 billion, driven by higher weapons deliveries.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Boeing has been witnessing strong growth in demand for its rotocraft and rotary wing programs that include the CH-47 Chinook. This was evident as Boeing won an FMS contract to deliver CH-47 helicopters to the Royal Canadian Air Force along with deliveries to Spain and Saudi Arabia. We believe the latest contract indicates the strong demand that Boeing would enjoy in the days ahead.Meanwhile, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget in February that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary from the proposed budget. Such inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 93% in a year, compared with the industry’s gain of 40.7%. The outperformance was primarily led by robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and for its military jets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The top line also improved 2% year over year.Organic sales to the U.S. government inched up 1%, while that to international and commercial customers improved 3%.

The downside can be attributed to lower volume for international aircraft modifications and lower volume of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft systems for foreign military customers.While operating income increased to $57 million from $56 million, operating margin expanded 30 bps to 8.3%.Communication Systems: Net sales at the segment declined 8% to $493 million due to lower production volume for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication systems for the Department of Defense.While operating income decreased 12% to $37 million, operating margin contracted 30 bps to 7.5%.Sensor Systems: Net sales at the segment improved 16% to $407 million driven by higher organic sales.Operating income remained flat at $48 million, while operating margin contracted 200 bps to 12%.Financial PositionAs of Mar 30, 2018, L3 Technologies had $374 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $662 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Long-term debt as of Mar 30, 2018, was $3,331 million compared with $3,330 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Net cash outflow from operating activities was $35 million at the end of first-quarter 2018 compared with the year-ago quarter’s cash inflow of $86 million.

74,LLL,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) business unit recently won a contract for supplying the AN/ALR-69A Digital Radar Warning Receiver System. The deal came under the foreign military sales (FMS) program that would further support its production requirements.Details of the DealThe contract is valued at $90 million and has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Electronic Warfare, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. Per the terms, Raytheon will offer fabrication, integration, testing and delivery of line replaceable and shop replaceable units for the radar system.Work related to the deal will be executed in Goleta, CA and Forest, MS. The entire work is scheduled to be completed by May 2023. Raytheon will utilize Japanese foreign military sales funds to partially finance the task.A Brief Note on AN/ALR-69A Radar SystemRaytheon’s AN/ALR-69A is the world’s first all-digital radar warning receiver that offers situational awareness in an affordable price. The ALR-69A(V) helps in the suppression of enemy air defenses, provides easy cross-platform integration, enhanced spectral and spatial coverage for high-sensitivity detection in dense signal environments. Per Raytheon, the ALR-69A is compatible with virtually any airborne platform.The upgraded system currently offers aircrews more options with its single-ship geolocation capability, providing them precise information on ground-based threat locations and precision-direction finding for airborne threats.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Raytheon’s Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) unit, which manufacture radar warning receivers, highly specializes in developing integrated sensors and communication systems for advanced warfare based missions. Raytheon's Electronic warfare products have been successfully able to earn a worldwide reputation for performance and reliability, over the last five decades.Over the past few years, Raytheon has witnessed radar related success from major investments including those made in Gallium Nitride (GaN), which helps in amplifying radio energy for radars, jammers and other devices.Notably, Raytheon’s SAS unit reported first quarter 2018 revenues of $1.57 billion, that inched up a mere 1% year over year.  We may expect the latest contract win to add more impetus to this unit’s growth in the second quarter.Furthermore, President Trump’s  fiscal 2019 defense budget proposed includes an investment plan of $13.7 billion in science and technology, which includes electronic warfare technologies as well.Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, we expect the company to win more such radar related contracts in days ahead.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock has improved about 29.3% in the last twelve months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 27.4%. The outperformance was most likely led by the company’s strong international sales and a robust balance sheet.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Raytheon Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

75,LLL,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract for the procurement of Technical Insertion 18/20 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) insertion systems, pre-cable kits and spares. It will also provide production support services. The deal includes options, which, if exercised, will bring its cumulative value to $433 million.Details of the DealValued at $22.8 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, and Clearwater, FL, while the rest will be executed in Syracuse, NY and Marion, FL.Lockheed Martin will have to complete the work by May 2024.About A-RCI SystemsA-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines. A-RCI uses a progression of technology insertions (TI) to enhance sonar signal processing which helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments, without being counter-detected. Additionally, it facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions as well as under-ice operations.Reasons Behind Lockheed’s SelectionSince late 90’s, Lockheed Martin’s introduction of the A-RCI Sonar Systems has been a very effective introduction to its product portfolio, offering improved acoustic quieting measures at reasonable costs. Ever since its inception, it has successfully been able to upgrade the system multiple times, which is extensively preferred in U.S. submarine fleets.Inevitably, Lockheed Martin has successfully been selected by the US. Department of Defense for contracts related to A-RCI Systems.Further, Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems segment, which designs and manufactures the A-RCI Sonar Systems, generated revenues of $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting almost 27.5% of its total revenues, led by higher sales for its integrated warfare systems and sensors programs along with (C6ISR) programs.Budget Revision – Lockheed’s GainLockheed Martin, being the Pentagon’s largest and prime defense contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts to its credit. In line with this, President Trump’s recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for an investment plan of $13.5 billion, which also includes $1.7 billion for the procurement of 43 AEGIS Combat Systems. Evidently, such provisions reflect solid growth prospects for the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems segment, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin going ahead.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 13.1% in the last one year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 40.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

77,LLL,"U.S. President Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods, while Beijing warned it would retaliate. This has heightened the trade spat between the two of the world’s largest economies. Investors, naturally, have turned nervous as earnings of companies could be at risk in the event of a global trade war.But there are some companies that might benefit. Among these are domestic producers of goods that do limited business in China, and companies with solid growth narratives as their promising outlook remains unfazed by the change in tariffs. Thus, investing in such winners at times of a trade war will not be a bad proposition.Trump Ups the Stake in Trade WarThe chances of a trade clash between Washington and Beijing intensified after Trump instructed the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to figure out $200 billion in imports from China for additional tariffs of 10%. He added that the United States may impose tariffs on another $200 billion provided the Asian nation retaliates.Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports. The tariffs will be passed in two phases. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later.Trump said that “the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world” and that the U.S. “will continue using all available tools to create a better and fairer trading system for all Americans.”The tariffs are intended to force China change its unfair practices with respect to technology and innovation. But regrettably China is hell-bent on increasing its tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. exports (read more: Trade War Fears Grip Wall Street: Buy 5 Ultra-Safe Stocks).Global Fund Managers Turn to AlibabaTrade wars are headwinds for companies as these erode profit margins and affect the overall economy. Thus, this rising tension has compelled top fund managers to look for companies that can emerge as winners. These companies have a strong domestic business and are unperturbed by import tariffs or in other words have a dominant market position.George Maris, a portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund has identified one such company. That is none other than Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report), primarily, because of its domestic exposure.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.7% compared with the Internet - Commerce industry’s estimated rally of 12.3%. The company has also outperformed the industry in the last year (+50.7% compared with +49.1%).Google, Facebook & Axon Enterprise Undeterred by a Trade WarCompanies that have long-term growth narrative will also not be affected by a trade war. Notable, among them are Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report). Google’s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising, since the search engine controls more than 40% of the U.S. digital ad market. Google’s focus on smart home technology, cloud data centers and automated driving drives the company’s earnings. All these areas are unlikely to be affected by a trade war.       Similarly, Facebook’s growth is mostly in digital advertising. Facebook controls 20% of the U.S. digital ad market, while Instagram controls another 5%. Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs.Axon Enterprise sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world. Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover, which gives the stock a solid growth narrative.In fact, shares of Alphabet, Facebook and Axon Enterprise rose 2.1%, 1.3% and 2.7% on Jun 18, respectively despite Trump’s threat to escalate the trade fight with China.Why Thinking Small is Not the Only Thing to Do Now?In the wake of Trump’s tariff announcement, investors seem to be shifting into small-cap stocks. And why so? This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large-caps. But, in reality, the difference isn’t much. Per data from FactSet Research, small-caps stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive 20.6% of their revenues from outside the United States, while stocks from the broader S&P 500 derive 30.3%.Satellite player Harris, electrical equipment maker Hubbell, seller of lighting equipment Acuity Brands, aerospace and defense players KLX and L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report), conglomerate Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report), and factory control specialist Rockwell Automation derive a meagre 10% of revenues from China, per UBS.Goldman stated that CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), CVS Health Corp, Dollar General Corp, Public Storage, Verizon Communications Inc and Wells Fargo derive 100% of their sales from the United States. Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is another company that derives 95% of its sales from the country, Goldman added. Hence, it’s quite natural that these companies stand to gain the most as trade war escalates. After all, their profits aren’t getting eroded due to limited exposure to foreign markets.5 Solid ChoicesThus, investing in the aforesaid stocks as the specter of a global trade war looms seems prudent.

78,LLL,"In a not so surprising move on May 8, the United States withdrew from the historic deal designed to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Further, a spate of other sanctions is likely to be slapped on the Middle Eastern country. President Trump has characterized the Iran nuclear agreement as a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.”However, since the deal was suspended, defense stocks have rallied, primarily due to international geopolitical tensions that such developments give rise to. Investors can make the most of this opportunity to bet on the top defense stocks for alluring returns.Geopolitical Tensions Post Trump’s AnnouncementQuite expectedly, the sanctions and a complete annulment of the deal hasn’t gone down too well with Iran. The country has openly criticized such a decision by Trump, with its president Hassan Rouhani stating that Iran choses to stay in the deal even without the United States.Adding to the already tense environment, state-governed media from Syria reported on the afternoon of May 8 that Israel had fired missiles on sites near Damascus that are linked to Iran. Further, Saudi Arabia stated on May 9 that its air force had neutralized two more ballistic missiles over its city Riyadh, apparently fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen.Analysts fear that if the nuclear deal is not kept alive till the end of this year and if U.S. reimposes sanctions that were already in effect before the deal, the situation may worsen. Going by the trend, Trump is unlikely to budge from his decision and the nuclear deal might not make it through the next year. Such circumstances are likely to aggravate tensions to quite an extent.Defense Stocks on a TearDefense heavyweights such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (RTN), Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) have rallied since Trump’s annulment of the deal. Between May 8 and May 11, shares of these giants have gained 1.4%, 2.6%, 1%, 1.7% and 2.4%, respectively, on the back of geopolitical uncertainties associated with such developments.Defense contractors with significant exposure to the Middle East are poised to gain immensely from international tensions that are flaring up. Such companies will capitalize on increased orders for missile defense and tactical missile systems along with increased demand for ships and other aircraft equipment.4 Hot ChoicesWith escalating international tensions and the unlikelihood of a reversal in Trump’s decision, it's not difficult to imagine why defense stocks might get a shot in the arm. In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is a provider of aerospace systems, communication, electronic, and sensor systems for military purposes as well as homeland security.The company is based out of New York. The expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.78%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 1.9% over the past 60 days. L3 Technologies has gained 5.9% in the past six months.Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) engages in research, design, development and manufacture of aerospace systems and products.The company is based out of Bethesda. The expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 19.70%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 2.7% over the past 60 days. Lockheed has gained 3.4% in the past six months.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) engages in designing, developing, manufacturing and supporting commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight, and launch systems.The company is based out of Chicago.

79,LLL,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a $24.8 million contract for procuring the Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS) Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) to support the U.S. Navy’s P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft. Work related to the deal is expected to complete in March 2022.Details of the DealPer the terms, Boeing will provide logistics and engineering data for the PSE. Moreover, through this deal, the aircraft giant will offer product support analysis, training information, technical manuals and proof-load documentation. These capabilities will enable Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division Lakehurst, in analyzing source data, activating organic support and allowing the Naval Supply Systems Command to provision the PSE.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ. Majority of the work will be carried out in Richardson, TX. Boeing will utilize fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds for completing the task.What’s P-8A Poseidon?Boeing's P-8A is an aircraft designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, maritime surveillance and reconnaissance missions, capable of broad-area maritime and littoral operations. It is also effective at search and rescue missions. P-8 is a derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, which combines Superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability in the future battle space.A Brief Note on AAS and PSEThe AAS is multi-function radar installed on the P-8 Poseidon aircraft, designed to provide multi-function detection and tracking of moving targets, and high resolution ground mapping of land, littoral and water areas.On the other hand, Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) supports the P-8 Poseidon along with other major aircraft programs by offering flight line and intermediate maintenance level test equipment as well as automated test equipment for the complete range of aircraft systems.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Its defense segment, known as Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS), witnessed approximately 13% year-over-year increase in first-quarter 2018 revenues to $5.76 billion, driven by higher weapons deliveries. We believe, the latest contract, along with the other notable ones that the company won in recent times, will allow the BDS segment to reflect similar solid results in upcoming quarters as well.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte lies in the development of combat-proven aircraft such as the P-8A Poseidon. Also, the company has lately started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, for its fixed-wing military aircraft programs. Such capabilities have enabled Boeing in clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon on a frequent basis.Meanwhile, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget in February that provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Further, it also included an investment plan of $2.2 billion for 10 P-8A Poseidon Jets. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 92.8 % in a year compared with the industry’s gain of 42%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and for its military jets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few top-ranked stocks in the same sector are AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.

80,LLL,"FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) recently launched radar and thermal products for the use of militaries and government agencies such as border patrol agents. These new products include two FLIR Ranger mid-range panel radars and the Recon V UltraLite thermal monocular.The FLIR Ranger mid-range panel radars come with two variants, one with both land and air-based target detection capabilities and the other one with land detection capabilities. Notably, the R8SS-3D radars are capable of detecting both land and air targets like micro-drones. In fact, it can disclose the location and altitudes of small drones, apart from detecting vehicles and peoples on ground. The second variant, the R8SS radar, detects the land-based targets only. Both the radars work within an existing data network and have the capability to detect more than 500 threats as well as their locations at the same time.Moreover, the company introduced the latest thermal monocular in the Recon series — the FLIR Recon V UltraLite. Notably, the Recon V UltraLite weighs lighter than previous versions and is designed to be used as a handheld device or can be mounted to a tripod or any other fixed place.Existing Business ScenarioFLIR Systems’ core strength of providing reliable and effective imaging as well as threat-detection technologies is expected to drive growth. Additionally, increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military to personal hand-held cameras and Smartphones, continues to fuel growth in this market. The company also remains extremely committed toward introduction of innovative products to expand its customer base and strengthen foothold in new markets.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 14.9%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 7.3%.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s government and military business has been faring well over the past few quarters driven by its CDMQ model. Through this model the company develops technology by investing in research & development and then equips it with military standards for sale to the government. Also, FLIR Systems has been able to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets using this model. Going ahead, the company expects CDMQ model to improve the prospects of its government business, thereby adding to its strength.Despite these tailwinds, FLIR Systems’ gross margins are vulnerable to a host of factors, including product mix changes and manufacturing cost absorption. In addition, high manufacturing cost absorption is likely to restrict the company’s growth.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (CVU  -  Free Report). While AeroVironment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), L3 Technologies and CPI Aerostructures carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

81,LLL,"L-3 Technologies, Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Vertex Aerospace business unit has won a modification contract worth $10.25 million for providing logistics support to the T-1A aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.Details of the DealPer the agreement, L-3 Technologies will offer contractor-operated maintained supply services, over and above, on-equipment maintenance along with data and field service representatives.Work is scheduled to be over by Mar 31, 2018, and will be executed at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas; Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas; and Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to finance the task.A Brief Note on T-1A AircraftThe T-1A aircraft is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer aircraft used for advanced pilot training. It is used by the Air Force for flying strategic, tactical airlift and tanker aircraft.Our ViewThe defense industry received a boost when the U.S. Senate approved a fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion in September 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations, like buying weapons and paying for the troops. The remaining $60 billion is proposed for Overseas Contingency Operations and will be utilized to fund military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.This raised budget is expected to help draw orders for major defense contractors like L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report).During the third quarter of 2017, owing to the loss of the re-competition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract, the company decided to sell its Vertex Aerospace unit, anticipating that the carrying amount of the goodwill for this unit may not be recoverable. Thus, the latest contract may not prove profitable for L3 Technologies.Nevertheless, excluding Vertex Aerospace, units of L3 Technologies cater to various defense-related products, which we believe will help the company maintain its leading position in the global security market. In fact, divesting Vertex Aerospace seems to be a prudent move as continuing with a loss-incurring segment offers no benefit to a company’s growth. Instead streamlining its operations toward other realms of the defense space will be more gainful.Such contract wins may or may not benefit the company, as we are not yet aware of what the company’s strategy will be regarding the services it provides through Vertex Aerospace, once it sell out this unit; i.e. whether to keep all the services or a few of them.Price MovementShares of L3 Technologies have rallied 20.5% year to date, lagging the industry’s gain of 28.5%.The underperformance can be attributed to low contract orders from international markets and weak performance in some of the product lines.Zacks RankL3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It had two multifunction displays in each cockpit; the displays provided navigation, weapon delivery, aircraft performance and communication data.Although, Boeing delivered the 221st and final T-45 training jet to the Navy in November 2009, it  continued to support the T-45 fleet by providing engineering, logistics and support equipment in partnership with BAE Systems plc (BAESY), which supplied the aircraft’s rear and center fuselage sections, wing assembly and vertical tail.Our ViewL3 Technologies is transforming its business portfolio to focus more on defense electronics, communications and ISR markets where it has leading positions. Toward this end, its Aerospace Systems segment, constituting Vertex Aerospace unit, delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides engineering, modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems.However, during the third quarter, owing to the loss of the recompetition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract, the company decided to sell off its Vertex Aerospace unit, anticipating that the carrying amount of the goodwill for this unit may not be recoverable. So the latest contract may not benefit L3 Technologies.Nevertheless, excluding Vertex Aerospace, units of L3 Technologies caters to various defense-related products, which we believe will help the company to maintain its leading position in the global security market. In fact, divesting Vertex Aerospace seems to be a wise decision as continuing with a loss-incurring segment offers no benefit to a company’s growth. Instead streamlining its operations toward other realms of the defense space will surely be profitable for L3 Technologies. Toward this end, in the third quarter, the company combined its Greenville and Waco operations of Aerospace segment and reduced headcount by over 700 people, to cut cost and add more value to its business.Meanwhile, the defense industry got a heavy boost when the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion this September. This increased budget is expected to rake in more orders for defense majors such as L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Price Performance L3 Technologies stock has returned 21.8% over a year, underperforming the 30.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts implemented by the U.S. government.Zacks RankL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for value based on our styles scores.OutlookWhile estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

84,LLL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently secured a hybrid contract worth $391.8 million for procurement of enhanced night vision goggle, binocular. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by May 2, 2021.The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Per the terms of the agreement, locations and funding for the task will be determined with each order.A Brief Note on Night Vision BinocularL3 Technologies’ binocular night vision device (BNVD) is a compact, lightweight, third-generation dual-tube goggle with an ergonomic low-profile design and offers superior situational awareness compared to a single-tube goggle.Notably, BNVD has been developed based on the company’s battle-proven AN/PVS-15 night vision binocular which enables increased survivability.The BNVD's twin-tube design provides protection in the field against failure or damage versus a single-tube night vision goggle. It can be used as a monocular when needed.The company’s BNVD was designed to increase system resolution, significantly reduce head-borne weight, improve system center of gravity, provide additional operational utility and improve overall situational awareness as compared to currently fielded dual-tube goggles. Our ViewGrowing concern for nation security has increased adoption of night vision devices from military & defense sectors across the world. Per a report from Reuters, night vision goggle segment is set to acquire the largest market share of night vision devices, between 2016 and 2022.With North America leading the night vision device market during the forecast period, it is imperative to mention that L3 Technologies enjoys a leading position in night vision equipment. However, in the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing fewer deliveries of enhanced night vision goggle products to the U.S. Army as contracts near completion.Now that the company has won a new contract for BNVD, its Sensor Systems segment can be expected to see a significant top-line growth in the second quarter of 2018.In February 2018, President Trump proposed a fiscal 2019 defense budget that aims at spending $716 billion on national security.  Notably, with this increased defense spending proposal President Trump, intended at rebuilding the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and geared up Joint Force. We believe the aforementioned contract win is an instance for such intentions and may expect L3 Technologies to win more such contracts in days ahead, as the U.S. government works on realizing its dream for a more lethal military.Price PerformanceShares of L3 Technologies have rallied about 19.9% in a year against h the broader industry’s 2.9% decline. The outperformance may have been driven by the company’s growth in commercial aviation market.Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks    L3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are AeroVironment (AVAV  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report). While AeroVironment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AeroVironment recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 147.43% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings has risen by 10 cents to $1.00 in the past 60 days.Boeing recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 29.51% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 56 cents to $14.61 in the past 60 days.Wesco Aircraft recorded a positive earnings surprise of 29.41% in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has risen by 4 cents to 74 cents in the past 60 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

85,LLL,"In an attempt to expand its footprint in the cyber security market, L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently signed an acquisition deal to purchase two information security firms — Azimuth Security and Linchpin Labs — for a total of $200 million. On completion of the takeovers, both the acquirees will combinedly operate as L3 Trenchant.L3 Technologies expects the acquisitions to be completed by the second half of 2018. While Linchpin Labs focuses on developing custom software systems and applications, Azimuth Security operates as an independent information security consultancy.Benefits of the DealThe aforementioned deal is expected to significantly boost L3 Technologies’ existing C6ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber-Defense and Combat Systems, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) capabilities. In fact, management believes this deal to be a strategic one in bolstering L3 Technologies’ position as a C6ISR solutions provider.On completion, positive synergies from this deal should drive the company’s future growth in cyber security market worldwide. Also, the acquired companies are expected to help L3 Technologies in delivering advanced capabilities integral to a variety of complex ISR and classified missions after the deal is closed.Post closure of the deal, L3 Trenchant is expected to add approximately $65 million to L3 Technologies’ net sales, after amortization of acquired deferred revenues, in 2019. The deal will also be slightly earnings per share accretive in 2019, post adjustment of employee retention expenses and business combination purchase accounting, including intangible asset amortization expenses.Our ViewCyber-attacks, data losses and compromised networks are constant threats, which in turn make cybersecurity essential to any given country’s national security. With the United States being the most technologically advanced country worldwide, it remains highly susceptible to cybersecurity attacks. Considering this and the fact that L3 Technologies is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, the company enjoys a dominant position in U.S. cybersecurity market.In recent times, a handful of cyber-attack incidences have reflected the weaknesses of the information security space in the United States. For instance, the hacking of Equifax’s database in 2017 that compromised sensitive information of 143 million U.S. consumers and the latest Facebook data leak have highlighted the immense need to strengthen the nation’s cyber security measures.  These incidents must have prompted the U.S. administration to increase its focus on matters related to cyber security.Evidently, the U.S. fiscal 2019 budget, including $15 billion of budget authority for cybersecurity-related activities, reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2018’s spending provision. Such promising spending plans should entice companies providing cyber security solutions like L3 Technologies to strengthen their portfolio. We believe the latest buyout will enable the company to secure more cyber security related contracts from the U.S. administration in days ahead.Moreover, the cybersecurity market size is expected to grow from $137.9 billion in 2017 to $231.9 Billion by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11% during the forecast period (according to Markets and Markets).  Thus, L3 Technologies boasts immense growth opportunities in the global cyber security market and the latest deal should allow it to capture larger shares in this expanding market, going ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of L3 Technologies have increased 19.6% compared with the industry’s 25.2% rally. The underperformance can be attributed to low contract orders for the company from international markets and weak performance in some of the product lines.Zacks Rank & Key PicksL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Engility Holdings (EGL  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

88,LLL,"The Q3 earnings season has begun on an optimistic note, with 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) reporting encouraging numbers as of Oct 20.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these members rose 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. The earnings beat ratio for these members was 71.3%, while that for top line was 70.1%.Coming to the Aerospace-Defense industry, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) released its quarterly result on Oct 24, wherein the company's earnings were lower than what most analysts had expected. Nevertheless, with several other defense behemoths set to report third-quarter numbers this week and considering the favorable budget trend prevailing in this industry, we may expect the industry’s earnings scenario to improve.Notably, projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at a mixed quarter, when compared to the overall Q3 forecast for the S&P 500 cohort. The Sector’s earnings are likely to decline 12.9% on 5.3% higher revenues; while earnings for S&P 500 members are likely to rise 2.6% on 5% higher revenues, as of Oct 20.Interestingly, defense stocks in the third quarter reached new-all-time highs for multiple times, courtesy of the varied supportive defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. In particular, the favorable budgetary amendments made by the U.S. government, like the passing of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 million, have boosted the growth prospects of defense stocks. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon to ‘rebuild’ the U.S. Army also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are surely to gain traction in the near term.With 180 S&P 500 members lined up for  their quarterly results release this week, let’s take a look at two defense majors — Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) —  both of which are scheduled to release quarterly results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Raytheon’s Missile Systems segment is a major growth driver. The third quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit, on the back of contract wins for its product line. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales is $1,980 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.2%.Apart from its strong forte in the domestic front, international business expansion has also been another significant growth driver for Raytheon. The company is currently witnessing strong demand for varied product line not only from the Middle East but also from Asia Pacific. We believe once the company reports third-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Moreover, during second-quarter earnings call, Raytheon’s management raised its EPS guidance to reflect the company’s improved operating performance alongside expecting the bottom line to grow in the third quarter. In line with this our consensus estimate for Raytheon’s earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, reflecting annual growth of 6.4%.Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Raytheon has the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

While operating margin is anticipated to lie in the mid-9% range, earnings per share is projected to be between $1.85 and $1.95.However, the company expects Aerospace Systems segment to decline in the third quarter compared with the first half of 2017. This is primarily due to certain contract price modifications at Vertex sliding into the fourth quarter of 2016, and sales mix in Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance as well as aircraft systems.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that L3 Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is becausethe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

89,LLL,"Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2 before the opening bell.Increased demand for 737 jets is expected to boost Spirit AeroSystems’ first-quarter revenues. However, change in accounting standards and contributions from higher production rates set to boost bottom line in late 2018 are projected to hurt quarterly earnings.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. QuoteWill Fuselage Systems Drive Growth?Fuselage Systems segment, which represents more than 50% of Spirit AeroSystems’ total sales, has been a major growth driver for the company. The segment’s revenues increased 12.2% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily driven by higher production deliveries on the Boeing 737 program. With Boeing being the company’s primary client and its first-quarter deliveries reflecting a solid 16.8% improvement for 737 models, the delivery upside is likely to boost Fuselage Systems segment’s revenues. Therefore, we may expect to witness a rise in this segment’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $933 million, reflecting year-over-year rise of 1.7%.Other Factors at PlayThe company is focusing on executing the multiple production rate increases, meeting the targets on safety, quality, delivery and costs. In 2018, production rates for 737 will increase to 52 aircraft per month. The A350 will rise to 10 aircraft per month in 2018, while Boeing is working on increasing the 787 to 14 aircraft per month. Such increased production rates are likely to bolster Spirit AeroSystems’ overall revenues. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $1.70 billion reflects year-over-year growth of 0.5%.During the fourth-quarter earnings call, management announced that it expects the company to deliver lower earnings as earnings contributions from higher production rates are expected in the latter part of 2018. Moreover, shortened accounting contracts are absorbing higher percentage of near-term cost increases to support these rates, thereby weighing on the bottom line. Also, due to some changes in its pension accounting, the company forecasts to incur forward loss in the range of $15-$20 million.

90,LLL,"The global stock market continues to stagger as the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China gains steam. The escalating trade dispute has already hit the U.S. economy, with punitive duties now in place for steel and aluminum and the White House threatening auto import tariffs.With no drastic near-term improvement expected in the US-China trade relations, investors continue to remain skeptical about the equity market’s growth. This has been reflected in the aerospace and defense stocks’ performance over the past five trading sessions, which failed to rally in spite of witnessing a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Evidently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — declined 5.3%, respectively, in the last five trading sessions.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) — secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Moreover, L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) completed its Vertex Aerospace divestiture.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for June 29, 2018 here)Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1.

91,LLL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently made an announcement regarding completion of its Vertex Aerospace business’ sale to a New York-based private equity firm named American Industrial Partners, for $540 million. The transaction, which was originally approved in October 2017, was finally wrapped up on Jun 29, 2018.The terms of the agreement also included divestiture of the company’s Crestview Aerospace and TCS business units. While Crestview provides rotary aircraft component fabrication and assembly services, TCS provides engineering services and logistics support.Reasons Behind the DivestitureThe contract price modifications at the Vertex Aerospace unit have lately raised concerns about growth in L3 Technologies’ Aerospace Systems segment.  In fact, the company identified the unit to be its most challenging business, and remained skeptical about its growth rate and profitability.Consequently, the company decided to divest the Vertex Aerospace business along with the other two units, in order to exit the logistics solution and maintenance services business for military aircraft, where it does not provide complex ISR systems integration and modification.Our ViewL3 Technologies' decision to sell off its Vertex Aerospace unit along with other smaller units is a strategic step toward aligning and optimizing its portfolio. The divestiture is likely to allow the company focus its resources on higher value-added and more profitable businesses.Economically, the transaction should be beneficial for the company, as it expects to record a gain of approximately $400 million after tax, owing to the divestiture. We may expect L3 Technologies to invest the cash proceeds from this deal in its continued core operational growth, in line with its capital allocation strategies and plans.Companies mostly divest their business units either to shed of segments that are not part of their core operations, to strengthen their core portfolio and serve better, or to eliminate poor-performing units. In case of the aforementioned divestiture, both these agendas were appropriate. Such divestitures are nothing new in the defense space.For instance, Leidos Holdings (LDOS  -  Free Report) has recently announced its agreement to divest its commercial cyber security arm to Capgemini, as this unit was not performing very well in the disaggregated cybersecurity market.Price MovementShares of L3 Technologies have rallied 13.5% year to date, lagging the industry’s growth of 22.6%. The underperformance can be attributed to low contract orders for the company from international markets and weak performance in some of the product lines.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    L3 Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS  -  Free Report) and CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (CVU  -  Free Report)While Kratos Defense & Security Solutions sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), CPI Aerostructures carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

93,LLL,"The U.S. aerospace and defense space hogged into limelight post Defense Secretary James Mattis’ comments regarding military deployment in Afghanistan. At a congressional hearing on Oct 3, Mattis announced that he is set to review the rules of the United States’ military engagement in Afghanistan, hinting at a possible increase in the number of deployed troops.Meanwhile on Oct 9, while criticizing North Korea’s repeated missile tests Mattis asked the U.S. Army to prepare for action in response to Kim-Jong’s rapid hostility. He also termed North Korea’s move as a serious threat to global peace. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace space, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the green zone. Notably, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index surged 2.2%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index rose 1.3% during this period.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) secured notable contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD).

94,LLL,"L3 Technologies Inc (LLL  -  Free Report) announced that its business unit has been awarded a $27.7-million modification contract for T-1A aircraft from the U.S. Air Force. Per the terms of the deal, the company will provide contractor-operated maintained supply services, over and above, on-equipment maintenance along with data and field service representatives. Work related to the contract will be carried out at multiple locations and are expected to be concluded by Jan 31, 2018.T-1A aircraft is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer aircraft for advanced pilot training. It is used by the Air Force for flying strategic/tactical airlift or tanker aircraft.L3 Technologies’ Long-Term StrategyL3 Technologies is transforming its business portfolio to focus more on defense electronics, communications and ISR markets where it has leading positions. The company follows a disciplined divestment strategy to efficiently focus on core operations. The Aerospace Systems (AS) segment of the company delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides engineering, modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems.Additionally, the company is also gaining from inorganic growth. The company has made regular strategic expansions, such as Implant Sciences’ explosives trace detection (ETD) assets. This also includes the acquisition of OceanServer Technology, Inc, a developer and manufacturer of autonomous, lightweight Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in recent times which have further boosted its product portfolio. With the acquisition of Implant Sciences, L3 Technologies’ capabilities in the global aviation security and national security markets were highly enhanced.Defense ScenarioThe defense industry got a heavy boost when the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The remaining $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.This increased budget is expected to rake in more orders for various companies in the industry such as Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc. which are dealing with different verticals of U.S. Defense.Price MovementShares of L3 Technologies have rallied 25.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 22.3%.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

95,LLL,"Sensor systems maker FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) recently clinched a firm-fixed-price order worth $74.7 million to deliver TacFLIR surveillance cameras in support of the U.S. Army EO/IR-Force Protection (FP) program. The program offers enhanced perimeter security and force protection for U.S. troops stationed across the world.Per the order, the U.S. Army will purchase the systems through Army Contracting Command, Redstone. Under the same program, FLIR Systemshad secured an $8.8-million contract in third-quarter 2017, which required it to deliver other FLIR Ranger radars.  As part of this program, the company has delivered more than a thousand of these EO/IR sensors to the U.S. Army, including a variety of systems. The recent award substantiates its proven ability to rapidly deploy its technology for critical missions, as well as validates the effectiveness of its commercially developed, military qualified approach.The systems will be manufactured in Wilsonville, OR, with deliveries commencing in 2017 and scheduled to be completed in a year.FLIR Systems recently streamlined its operating structure to leverage its vertical integration as well as focus on core markets. The company has realigned six of its segments, namely OEM & Emerging Markets, Surveillance, Instruments, Security, Detection and Maritime into three units. The new segments will be called Government & Defense, Industrial and Commercial.Restructuring activities undertaken by the company since 2013 have helped the company reap synergies and drive profitable growth, combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions.Quarter to date, FLIR Systems’ shares have returned 5.4%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 2.6%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s solid execution and streamlined business have helped it drive improvements in backlog, margins, and net income, in recent times.We believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels indicate the company’s resiliency, which will enable it to sail through difficult economic times and drive growth. It should be noted that brokers are on the sidelines for the stock as its earnings estimates remained unchanged over the month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 also remained steady at $1.85 over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).

96,LLL,"On Sep 3, North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb — its sixth and largest nuclear device — that has been tested since 2006. Per the predictions, North Korea desires to be recognized as a nuclear state like Russia with the test of this nuclear bomb.Notably, the test sent jitters through global financial markets, as a result of which the broader market indices slipped on Sep 5. Also, it has considerably increased pressure on the Trump administration, with this nuclear test being the most severe foreign affairs emergency that the United States has witnessed in years.On a bright note, U.S. defense stocks took a surge following this nuclear test, which indicated at yet another altercation between North Korea and America.Why the Bomb Is a ThreatThe hydrogen bomb, which is claimed to be small and light, can be mounted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile. In fact, the test triggered a 6.3 magnitude tremor around the area of its test site.Also, North Korea’s Parliamentary Defense Committee estimated that the bomb had a yield of 100 kilotons. This indicates that it is seven times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima (13 kilotons) and five times more powerful than the one dropped on Nagasaki (20 kilotons).Earlier, North Korea had made claims of testing such weapons but failed to succeed. However, in a recent televised statement, the country declared that this time they succeeded and guaranteed that North Korea now possesses a credible nuclear warhead.Moreover, on Aug 29, North Korea had fired a missile that passed over Hokkaido — the second largest island of Japan — before landing in the sea. Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, stated the incident to be exceptional, serious and severe threat to the country itself. U.S. President, Donald Trump, also responded by saying 'all options on table’ when it comes to dealing with Pyongyang.Meanwhile, North Korea has been striving toward becoming a nuclear power over the last few years. Also, the relationship between the United States and North Korea has significantly become unpleasant in last few months. A frequent cross-border missile test exchanges have added to the woes for both the nations. On top of that, last month, Trump said that threats coming from North Korea ""will be met with fire and fury,"" further strengthening the inter-country tension.   Therefore, we note that if North Korea has in fact effectively tested a hydrogen bomb, then the threat to the United States and its allies raises considerably.How United States ReactedIn response to the news of the hydrogen bomb test, the U.S. Defense Secretary, James Mattis, gave a strict warning to North Korea. Mattis said that if North Korea involves in any act of violence against the United States or its allies then it would have to face a massive military response.However he also offered a word of reassurance to North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un. Mattis added that United States does not intend to totally eradicate the country although it has many options to do so.Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has hinted that it will search for additional steps to isolate North Korea’s economy subsequent to its latest actions, particularly in connection with testing of missiles and nuclear weapons.To this end, the United States may increase pressure on China to discontinue its oil imports to North Korea, a move which can cripple the country in economically.Defense Stocks in FocusThe prospects of the U.S. military action against North Korea have also increased following Mattis’ stern warning. In light of the recent events, the U.S. defense stocks are likely to witness considerable gains in the coming days. Here are few stocks in the defense space that are expected to grow.Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), the largest defense contractor in the world, possess some of the high-profile missile defense programs including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and PAC-3 Missiles.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its projected EPS growth for the next five years is 6.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings moved up 0.7% over the last 60 days.Moreover, the stock was up 1.7% in the last month, outperforming the broader industry’s loss of 0.4%.Raytheon Co.

99,LLL,"The recent altercation between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent the major defense stocks rallying. Notably, Trump cautioned North Korea that if it does not refrain from repeated missiles threats, the U.S. will respond with “fire and fury.”In retaliation, Kim threatened to fire missiles on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses military bases. While the rest of the broader market reacted negatively to the escalated geopolitical tensions, defense stocks picked up pace.But it is imperative to mention that this tension between the U.S. and North Korea has not been the only driving force behind the defense stocks’ rally. In fact, the space has been a big market winner for quite some time now, on the back of Trump’s presidential win and a few other factors.However, major indices for the Aerospace sector ended up in the red in the trailing five trading sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index lost 0.8%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index declined 0.9% during this period.

100,LLL,"Defense major L3 Technologies Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Communications Systems business segment recently clinched a contract for testing, inspecting and upgrading the Marines Corp AN/TSC-156C and the Army AN/TSC-156B/D terminals. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 10, 2022.Valued at $48.8 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Per the terms of the deal, work locations and funding will be determined with each order.AN/TSC-156C & AN/TSC-156B/D TerminalsBoth AN/TSC-156C & AN/TSC-156B/D are tactical satellite communications (satcom) terminal that operates in the super high frequency over commercial and military satellites. Through these terminals, the company aids in providing flexible, mobile, high capacity, extended-range communications connectivity using military and commercial satellite space segments.Our ViewL3 Technologies is a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. Its Communications Systems segment offers airborne, space and surface data link terminals, ground stations, and transportable tactical SATCOM systems. This might enable the company to pose stiff competition to its peers like FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report), Arotech Corp (ARTX  -  Free Report) and Mikros Systems Corp. .With increasing prevalence of cyber attacks these days, strong and secured SATCOM systems are the need of the hour. U.S. being the largest digitally advanced country, is also the worst affected in terms of cyber crimes. This has pushed its focus toward strengthening its SATCOM communications even more in recent times. In this context, President Trump’s Fiscal 2017 appropriation budget request included funding worth $7.2 billion for operations and maintenance to address urgent readiness shortfalls across the joint force, including improvements in cyber intelligence capabilities.We believe, if this proposal gets approved, it will boost the revenues of defense contractors like L3 Technologies, which provides advanced communications solutions.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

101,LLL,"With the rise in demand for commercial jetliners both in the domestic and the international market, The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Commercial Airplanes segment has been receiving contracts regularly for delivering 737, 787 and 747 jets. We believe the impact of the same to get duly reflected in the company’s first-quarter 2018 results, slated to release on Apr 25, before the market opens.Solid Deliveries Buoy OptimismOn Apr 11, Boeing announced upbeat first-quarter 2018 commercial delivery figures. The company delivered 84 airplanes, up 8.9% year over year. The rise in delivery came on the back of  higher demand for 737 jets. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 132 in the first quarter of 2018 from 113 a year ago.Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners totaled 12 and 34, compared with 21 and 32, respectively in the year-ago period. For the 747 and 767 jets, the company delivered two and four jets, respectively compared with 1 and 2 in the year-ago quarter.737 — A Major Growth DriverDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been on the rise due to a steady improvement in the passenger and freight traffic. Per Boeing's current market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. Single-aisle jets are expected to be the major demand driver, comprising 72% of the total projection.Interestingly, the company’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, courtesy of its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Interestingly, majority of the commercial orders Boeing has won in 2018 belonged to the 737-fleet. In particular, recent ramp up in the production of 737 Max has been fueling the demand for 737-fleet.Considering the fact that management at Boeing expects its current-year revenues to reflect higher planned production of the 737 model, we expect this fleet of jet to play the role of a key catalyst for Boeing’s first-quarter results.The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteWill Huge Orders Drive the Top Line?Keeping with its trend, Boeing received a number of multi-billion-dollar orders in the first quarter. However, it has been witnessed that majority of these orders came for either 737-Max or 787-Dreamliners.  In particular, lower delivery rates for its 777-model marred the order growth for 737. Indeed, a huge drop of 43% was witnessed in the first quarter deliveries of 777 model, which clearly show lack of demand for this particular jet. In fact, realizing its declining demand, Boeing implemented a planned production rate decrease from seven per month to five per month during third-quarter 2017, which has been further reduced to the rate of 3.5 per month for 2018.This significant decline in 777 deliveries may outweigh the 16.8% improvement in 737 deliveries and might get reflected in the form of lower revenues for Boeing’s commercial jets in the upcoming results. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Commercial Airplanes segment’s revenues is pegged at $13.1 billion for the first quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.4%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

106,LLL,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.We expect inflow of military contracts from the Pentagon and product launches to continue boosting the military shipbuilder’s revenues in the quarter to be reported. Solid cash flow is also expected to get reflected in the upcoming results.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.Dividend Hike: A BoonGeneral Dynamics’ strong cash generating capability provides the company with financial flexibility, which in turn allows it to hike dividend significantly and repurchase shares. This, in turn, makes the stock a valuable pick for investors. Notably, its cash and cash equivalents were $2,983 million at 2017-end compared with $2,334 million at 2016-end. Moreover, its cash flow from operating activities was $3,879 million in 2017 compared with $2,198 million in 2016.Last month, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 10.7%. Impressively, the latest hike marked the 21st consecutive annual dividend hike.The raised dividend indicates General Dynamics’ optimism on solid cash inflow, which we believe will get reflected in its yet-to-be reported results.New Products & Orders to Boost SalesOrder flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers, and General Dynamics is no exception. Notably, the company’s business division, Electric Boat, clinched a modification contract worth $696.2 million for supplying long lead time materials for the construction of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 Virginia-class submarines.Moreover, in February, the company unveiled its newest aircrafts — Gulfstream G500 and Gulfstream G600 — at the Singapore Airshow. Such innovations are expected to provide impetus to Gulfstream business’ revenues, which we believe will get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $7.5 billion, reflecting 1.4% year-over-year growth. General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation Quote Other Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, General Dynamics offered to buy CSRA — an information technology provider — for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt. However, CACI International proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover. Interestingly, General Dynamics revised its acquisition deal with CSRA on Mar 20, 2018. Per the agreement, General Dynamics agreed to acquire all of CSRA’S outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash, reflecting an increase of 50 cents from the previous proposal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.47 per share, reflecting 0.4% annual decline. This might have been caused by higher R&D expenses that management expects the company to incur across 2018.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.18%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks in the Aerospace and Defense space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat:Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27.

107,LLL,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by regular contract wins along with higher commercial jet deliveries.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of big orders for its commercial jets in the first quarter including a $12-billion contract from American Airlines for 47 Dreamliners, a $8.8-billion order from Jet Airways for 75 737-Max jets, a $6.2-billion order from Lion Air Group for 50 737 MAX 10 jets and a $2.8-billion contract from Hawaiian Airlines for 10 787-Dreamliners.Among the defense contracts won in the first quarter, the significant ones include a $1.2-billion deal to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets and a modification deal with cumulative face value of $305 million for Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA fighter jet. Boeing also clinched a contract worth $312-million modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits. The company won a delivery order worth $430 million to provide F/A-18 planned maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support.In addition, on Mar 30, 2018 Boeing announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Saudi Arabian Military Industries to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia.Boeing has also agreed to provide the technological know-how required to install weaponry on the aircraft included in the JV as well as localize the supply chain for spare parts.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.Q1 Deliveries to Boost Bottom LineBoeing’s first-quarter deliveries showed an 8.9% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments declined 40.5% than the year-ago figure. Higher demand for the 737 jets primarily drove the year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries. Boeing’s total deliveries were 209 units in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 211 the year-ago period figure.Notably, during its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volume will drive its bottom line in 2018. Although, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries reflected solid growth and with this business constituting for almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we may expect to see a notable uptick in first-quarter earnings.In line with this, the consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.56 per share, reflecting a solid year-over-year increase of 27.4%. The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company Quote Cash Flow: A Strong PositiveDuring 2017, Boeing paid $3.42 billion in dividends and repurchased 46.1 million shares for $9.2 billion. This reflects strong balance sheet and cash flows that the company boasts, which in turn provide it financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Boeing generated $13.34 billion of operating cash flow at the end of 2017, up 27.1% year over year. The company projects to generate operating cash flow worth $15 billion for 2018, reflecting annual improvement of 12.4%. Therefore, we may expect its upcoming results to reflect such solid cash flow features, as we have witnessed in prior years, buoyed by the scrumptious orders that Boeing won in the first quarter. What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Well, Boeing possesses the right combination currently, as the Zacks Rank #2 company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%.

109,LLL,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won an $862.2 million modification contract for providing full-rate production of fifteen Lot 42 F/A-18E and three F/A-18F aircraft to the U.S Navy. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Details of the DealMajority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, St. Louis, MI and the rest would be performed in various locations across the United States. Work related to the deal is expected to get complete in June 2020.Growing Demand of F/A-18Boeing’s Super Hornet aircraft is continuously evolving to outpace future threats. Its radar, mission computers and sensors continue to evolve in order to meet extensive mission profiles. Due to the ever rising worldwide demand of military aircraft, Boeing has also developed the Advanced Block III Super Hornet to complement existing and future air-wing capabilities, which include battle-space situational awareness, counter stealth targeting, increased acceleration and improved survivability.Such major developments have enabled Boeing in witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F-18 aircraft. This is evident from the contract that it secured from Kuwait in the first quarter for delivering 28 F-18 Super Hornets. We believe that this latest contract will also help in substantiating Boeing jet fighters’ strong position in the global market.What’s Favoring Boeing?As Boeing’s key forte lies in manufacturing combat-proven aircraft, it has inevitably secured large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of its proven expertise in aerospace programs. Subsequently, revenues of its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment witnessed a 13% rise year over year to $5.76 billion in first-quarter 2018.Further, last month Boeing entered into an agreement to acquire KLX Inc., a major independent provider of aviation parts and services in the aerospace industry. The acquisition, once completed, will certainly help Boeing to enhance its global parts distribution and supply chain services, accelerate Global Service’s growth strategies, and position the company in effectively serving customers in a $2.6- trillion, 10-year services market.Meanwhile, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget in February that provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. Further, it also included an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18Jets. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 94.5% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 43.3%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few similar-ranked stocks in the same sector are Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (WAIR  -  Free Report).

110,LLL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract per which the company will procure new training systems as well as hardware and software upgrades for F/A-18C/D/E/F and EA-18G jets. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by April 2023.Valued at $218.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL. The latest deal will modify the existing aircrew training systems for these military aircraft. Further, this contract will support software configuration set upgrades, engineering change proposals, Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan upgrades and spare parts for hardware deliverables.Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy) and 2018 operation and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized to partly finance the task, which will be carried out in Arlington, TX.A Brief Note on F/A-18 & EA-18G JetsBoeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.The company’s EA-18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack platform which operates from either an aircraft carrier or from land bases. The aircraft helps combat electronic attack and suppresses enemy air defenses, particularly at the start and at early stages of on-going hostilities. The major contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) manufactures the rear and center fuselage sections of this jet.What’s Favoring L3 Technologies?Due to rising political uncertainties and terrorism worldwide, especially the growing crisis in the Middle East, the defense industry is gaining traction. Countries, throughout the world, are increasing their expenditure on various defense equipment, with aircraft being one of their top priorities.The United States is the largest spender in defense space. Apart from manufacturing high-end military jets, providing state-of-the-art training to pilots along with other software and hardware upgrades to aircraft form an integral part of the nation’s defense aircraft management.L3 Technologies’ Aerostructures business unit provides avionics hardware and software systems, while its Electronic Systems business segment offers aircraft simulation and training systems. In fact, realizing the expanding market for aircraft simulation and training market, L3 Technologies acquired Doss Aviation last September.Doss Aviation is the sole provider of initial flight training for U.S. Air Force pilots and offers curriculum coursework and flight training to both fixed-wing and unmanned aircraft pilots. Thus, by purchasing Doss Aviation, L3 Technologies significantly expanded its footprint in the military aircraft simulation and training market worth multi-billion-dollar.In February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts, which includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircraft. With F/A-18 and EA-18 aircraft being in high demand, procurement contracts for these jets from Pentagon will boost L3 Technologies’ profit margin, as the company will offer these jets’ necessary technological upgrades.With the budget including facilities investment of $10.5 billion, along with training solutions, we expect L3 Technologies to win more such contracts like the latest one in the coming days.Price PerformanceL3 Technologies stock has returned 25% over a year, underperforming the 28.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the weak performance that the company has been witnessing in some of its product lines. The downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure remains a concern.  Zacks Rank & Key PickL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Huntington Ingalls recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the last four quarters.

111,LLL,"Over the last week, Wall Street saw first-quarter 2018 earnings releases from several defense biggies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics. L-3 Technologies (LLL  -  Free Report) kick-started this week by reporting better-than-expected result for the first quarter. Today, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR  -  Free Report) is set to release Q1 numbers.As of Apr 27, 267 S&P 500 members announced their quarterly numbers, whose earnings improved 25.1%, while revenues increased 107.5%. Notably, the beat ratio for the bottom line was 76.8%, while that for top line was 73.8%.Therefore, the results reflect a strong show so far, with Q1 earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Coming to the Zacks Aerospace sector, projections for the stocks in this space, hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its fourth-quarter performance. Evidently, the sector's earnings are likely to improve 37.3% on 7.5% higher revenues in the first quarter, whereas fourth-quarter earnings for this sector improved 31.8% on 7.3% revenue growth. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Stocks in the aerospace-defense space remained on a growth trajectory in the first quarter, courtesy of fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal presented by President Trump. Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution. A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.With almost 921 companies (142 S&P 500 members) are slated to report first-quarter results this week, let's take a look at how the following defense stocks are poised before their earnings release on May 3.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.85%.Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News segment, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last few years. However, in the last few reported quarters, this segment’s top line has rebounded.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Newport News unit’s first-quarter revenues stands at $1,012 million, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.2%. A steady inflow of orders from the Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls’ results. However, in the first quarter, the company did not win any notable contracts.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

Again, free cash flow is forecasted in the range of $150 million to $200 million.However, the company expects Aerospace Systems segment to decline in the third quarter compared with the first half of 2017.

115,LLL,"Last week, the Wall Street saw second-quarter earnings releases from a handful of the defense biggies like L-3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report), Raytheon Co. (RTN  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), to name a few. Notably, most of these corporations came up with an earnings beat this quarter.We have already crossed the halfway mark of second-quarter 2017 earnings, with 57.6% or 286 of the S&P 500 index members having released their earnings report as of Jul 28. Reported earnings were up 11.3% year over year on 6.1% higher revenues. Among them, 74.5% surpassed earnings estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.For the remaining 214 index members, combined with 286 members that have already reported, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5% higher revenues this season, compared to last year, with four of the 16 Zacks sectors witnessing growth in the negative territory. Notably, this could be the fourth straight quarter to record earnings growth after five quarters of back-to-back declines.With over 1000 companies scheduled to report results this week, including 130 S&P 500 members, we believe this season to be a busy one. Now, let us focus on the defense sector as it is expected to see quite a few of the major defense contractors coming up with their financial numbers.In the Aerospace and Defense space, 96.7% of the index’s market cap has reported quarterly results as of Jul 28, with 88.9% beating on earnings and 66.7% exceeding revenue expectations.

(LLL  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.17% in the last reported quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.61%.Usually contract wins from the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States drive revenues for defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Unfortunately, the company did not secure any notable contract during the first quarter of 2018. This is likely to weigh on the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter.L3 Technologies’ strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividends, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.

The company’s balance sheet is expected to display solid figures during the earnings call.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

The company projects operating profit and bottom-line growth to benefit from the same in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Transdigm has been witnessing negative trends in some end markets, of late, like weaker defense after-market orders as well as soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to dent its top-line growth.Of late, the company’s Defense business’ performance has been better than expectations, adding to its strength.

121,LLL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because L3 Technologies is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for LLL in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for LLL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.33% heading into earnings season.L3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise L3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | L3 Technologies Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market.

122,LLL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.17%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.61%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dearth of Order: A ConcernUsually contract wins from the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States drive revenues for defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Unfortunately, the company secured no notable contract during the first quarter of 2018. This in turn is likely to weigh on the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales indicate year-over-year decline in the two major segments of the company.Moreover, soft commercial satellite market conditions continue to hurt aviation security and electronic systems along with commercial SATCOM and communication systems. Cumulatively, these factors are expected to drag down the company’s overall top line number.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying a 12.7% year-over-year decline.Tax Reform: A Boon?The latest U.S. tax reform boosted L3 Technologies’s fourth-quarter earnings per share by 99 cents. Expecting to witness similar gains in 2018 as well, the company has increased its 2018 earnings guidance.  However, the company is expected to incur $15 million pension expenses during the year, which will dent its earnings growth.  We believe, this along with the significant dearth of orders might impact the company’s bottom line adversely.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate for earnings shows 3.4% year-over-year decline for the upcoming quarterly result. L3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  L3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | L3 Technologies Inc. Quote Solid Cash FiguresL3 Technologies’ strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividends, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Continuing with its trend of consistent dividend hike, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 6.7% in February 2018 to 80 cents. This hike marked the 14th consecutive dividend increase for the company. Keeping up with its trend we may expect the company’s upcoming results to reflect similar solid balance sheet figures.Vertex Divesture: What Lies Ahead?Contract price modifications at Vertex Aerospace unit raised concern about L3 Technologies’ Aerospace Systems segment’s growth.  In fact, the company has identified this segment to be its most challenging business and remains skeptical about this unit’s growth rate as well as profitability.  However, as the company remains on schedule to sell Vertex by the middle of 2018, the divesture is likely to not have any impact in L3 Technologies’ first quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that L3 Technologies is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of +2.51%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: L3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with positive Earnings ESP increases the probability of a positive earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) while going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks in the Aerospace and Defense space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat:Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27.

(COL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell.The aviation electronics maker posted in-line earnings in the last reported quarter. Impressively, Rockwell Collins surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.50%.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Rockwell Collins' quarterly results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Rockwell Collins is likely beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Rockwell Collins has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Rockwell Collins carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with positive Earnings ESP increases the probability of a positive earnings surprise.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Rockwell Collins, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Rockwell Collins, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rockwell Collins, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayRockwell Collins remains the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers. The company continues to expand its operations in overseas markets driven in part by expanding populations and emerging economies. During the fiscal first quarter, BOC Aviation selected Rockwell Collins’ advanced avionics, as a baseline configuration on up to 74 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Moreover, AIRMARK Aviation of Singapore selected Rockwell Collins’ ADS-B Out solution to upgrade four of its Boeing 737-300 aircraft, with an option to fit one more.We believe these orders will boost the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter sales of $2.14 billion reflects a solid annual surge of 59.5%.Moreover, the company’s B/E Aerospace buyout, has been adding value to its top line and bottom-line growth ever since the deal’s completion. In fiscal 2017, its U.S. sales improved 18% as a result of improved accretions from this takeover.In line with this, we expect this acquisition to continue boosting the company’s earnings in the second quarter as well. Evidently, the Zacks consensus estimate for earnings in the second quarter stands at $1.75 per share reflecting an annual growth of 30.6%.Last September, Rockwell Collins entered into an agreement to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation for $30 billion. The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.Notably, shareholders of Rockwell Collins will be given all-cash consideration of $140 per share, reflecting a premium of nearly 7.5% from the company’s closing price of $130.29 on Sep 1, 2017. Interestingly, shares of Rockwell Collins is presently trading near the acquisition price but has not yet attained it. Considering this, investors even now have a possibility of gaining from this stock. We may expect further development on this transaction once the company releases its quarterly result.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.

124,LLL,"FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 58 cents per share, delivering a positive surprise of 3.6%.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +2.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of 44 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsFLIR Systems continues to benefit from its well-diversified business portfolio in terms of geographies, products and markets. Also, the company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have helped it to combat headwinds like currency fluctuations and difficult market conditions. Moreover, the company’s robust execution and streamlined business have enabled it to drive solid improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, net income and earnings per share. We believe the company’s strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels will continue driving profitable growth.Also, the company’s core strength in providing reliable and effective imaging & threat-detection technologies is expected to bolster its performance in the quarter. Meanwhile, increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military to personal hand-held cameras and Smartphones, continue to fuel growth in this market. Moreover, FLIR Systems’ government and military business has been faring well over the past few quarters driven by its CDMQ model.Further, the company’s persistent focus on introduction of innovative products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and expand its customer base. Notably, since the launch of Lepton technology, FLIR Systems has witnessed solid compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. We believe that steady market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well. In the meantime, its recent acquisitions are acting as major profit churners. The previously completed buyouts are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review.Despite these tailwinds, FLIR Systems’ gross margins remain vulnerable to a host of factors, including product mix changes and manufacturing cost absorption. Also, high manufacturing cost absorption is likely to restrict the company’s growth. Moreover, poor economic conditions across its key operating regions might hamper capital investment and consumer spending, thereby weighing on its profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS continue to benefit from such actions.FLIR Systems is enjoying strong top-line growth, as robust momentum in its commercial products and positive performance of most of its segments drive growth.

128,LLL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, L3 Technologies delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.36%. It is worth noting that the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.46%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAmong the highlights of the second quarter, L-3 Technologies clinched multiple contracts for providing commercial aviation training, resourcing and simulation solutions in 2017. The deals were awarded by global commercial operators and airline partners. With a total value of more than $115 million, these contracts included delivery of airline pilot training programs, airline pilot resourcing, mid-level and classroom devices, and the sale of eight full flight simulators (FFS) to date this year.Moreover, on the international frontier, the company continues to expand its footprint in key markets, particularly the Middle East and Asia, by adding resources and personnel to address opportunities and better serve its customers. We expect its result in the to-be-reported quarter to duly reflect such initiatives.Overall for the second quarter, L3 Technologies expects sales to be roughly $2.7 billion, reflecting flat organic growth. Earnings per share is projected to lie in between $1.90-$2.00. Again, free cash outflow is anticipated in the range of 50 million–150 million. Moreover, management expects the company to witness higher margins of about 9%.On the flip side, L3 Technologies has been witnessing weak performance in some of its product lines. The noteworthy aspect of this is the downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure, which might be reflected in second-quarters’ results.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects 8.11% year-over-year growth, the consensus for revenues is pegged at $2.70 billion, implying a 1.47% year-over-year improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that L3 Technologies will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of -0.99%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.01, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: L3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.55 million.What is Driving L3 Technologies?L3 Technologies is a consistent performer and has reported positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.13%. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate (three to five years) is 6.78%.Thanks to its quality product offerings, the company continuously receives contracts from the U.S. defense establishments and foreign governments. Funded backlog at the end of third- quarter 2017 was $9 billion, reflecting sequential growth of 5.8%.Apart from generating substantial organic revenue growth, thanks to its varied product range, L3 Technologies gains from inorganic growth. The strategic acquisitions made by the company have widened its market and created more opportunities.In addition to its strong presence in the U.S. defense space, the company continues to enjoy a steady flow of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts.

The fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget, reflecting a 10% hike from the FY16 level, was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017.  Notably, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights.The increase in the defense budget will also result in new orders for the major defense contractors and will have a positive impact on their performance and prices. Apart from L3 Technologies, other defense operators like Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) also touched their respective 52-week highs yesterday.Price MovementL3 Technologies has returned 40.9% in the past year, which is in line with the industry’s gain but much better than the S&P 500’s return of 23.2%.The company’s performance is driven by its non-platform-centric focus and broad diversification of programs.Zacks RankL3 Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

130,LLL,"With the United States accusing Pakistan of playing a ""double game"" with respect to fighting terrorism, the U.S. Aerospace & Defense space has seen a thrilling start to 2018. Per Reuters, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s statement to withhold aid worth $255 million to Pakistan clearly shows that the White House might be looking to build pressure on the country.Defense stocks moved north following escalating tensions between the nations, with the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace index rising 0.6% on Jan 2. Major defense companies like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation have gained 0.7%, 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively.Defense Eclipses Tech As WellBefore picking defense stocks which are likely to excel in 2018, let’s take a quick look at how these stocks have performed in 2017. Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector have rallied 38.2% in 2017, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index's 19.8% gain.  A comparison with the Tech sector, which has fared well all through 2017, also places Aerospace & Defense stocks at an elevated spot. Notably, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector has returned 27.2% in 2017, lagging the Aerospace Sector.  Considering the solid rally of 2017, let’s discuss factors that will warrant an outperformance by aerospace and defense stocks in 2018 as well.Will the Rally Continue?There’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has been a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.Courtesy of these developments, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.In the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion. While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, on the other hand Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Additionally, emerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.The Winning StrategyIn order to save investors the time-taking process of identifying key winners that crushed the market and are likely to gain further, we have created a screen using the Zacks Stock Screener.Herein, we have zeroed in on three Aerospace stocks, which have been recording better-than-expected results and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10% or more.

187,LLL,"We issued an updated research report on defense major, L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report), on Jul 19, 2017. The company is a prime system contractor for aircraft modernization and maintenance; Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) collection platforms; simulation and training; and government systems support services.In addition to its strong presence in the U.S. defense space, the company continues to enjoy a steady flow of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts as well. In particular, L3 Technologies will be definitely benefited from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and FMS agreements between the U.S. Government and foreign governments. In this line, the company secured new orders in Indonesia, Korea, China, South Africa, France, Japan and Kuwait during the first quarter of 2017.The company follows a disciplined divestment strategy to efficiently focus on its core operations. Toward this end, during the first quarter, it divested its CTC Aviation Jet Services Limited (Aviation Jet Services) business for approximately $1.3 million. The business provided non-core aircraft management and operational services as part of commercial training solutions based in the U.K. The company also sold out its Display Product Line for $7 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4 million for the company’s first-quarter results.L3 Technologies boasts a strong balance sheet that allows it to continue with its trend of consistent dividend hike. In this line, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 7.1% in the first quarter.Furthermore, the company’s stock has gained 20.2% in the last one year, outperforming the 17.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been driven by the strong growth that the company witnesses in the commercial aviation market. In particular, the continued recapitalization of fleets by the mature markets of North America and Europe must have boosted the company’s expansion.On the flip side, L3 Technologies has been witnessing weak performance in some of its product lines. The most worrying aspect of this is the downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure.In fact, L3 Technologies faces stiff competition from other majors in the Aerospace sector like FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report), Arotech Corp. (ARTX  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report).Zacks RankL3 Technologies currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

189,LLL,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is well under way with 53 S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 19. So far, the earnings trend appears impressive with tax cuts driving the results.Quarterly earnings of the 53 S&P members have improved 11.7% while revenues increased 7.5%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 81.1% while that for top line was 75.5%, as of Jan 19.Coming to the Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry , none of the stocks have reported results so far. However, considering the inherent stability of this industry, projections for the  Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its third-quarter performance.Evidently, the sector's earnings are likely to improve 6.6% on 5.7% higher revenues in the fourth quarter.  Third-quarter earnings for this sector declined 6.8%. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest  Earnings Preview .Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, courtesy of the various defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are likely to gain traction in the coming days. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with more developing nations expanding their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry's growth.With almost 262 companies (81 S&P 500 members) slated to report fourth-quarter results this week, let's find out where the following defense stocks stand before their earnings release on Jan 25.Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.68% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 6.50%.We expect the Missile Systems business unit of the defense major to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the quarter. Missile systems contribute nearly 30% of the company’s total sales and continue to be a major growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Missile systems sales is pegged at $2,219 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.1%.Apart from its strong hold in missile defense, the company also enjoys a leading position in offering cybersecurity, particularly on the domestic front. Moreover, its overseas business sales is also expected to boost results.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimates if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 17.24%.The Aerospace Systems segment comprises almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to growth. However, the segment managed to clinch very few contracts in the fourth quarter like the $445-million Air Force contract to support LAIRCM program. This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues, which stands at $2,861 million, reflecting an annual decline of 0.4%.The lack of substantial deals could adversely impact the top-line of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $6.37 billion, reflecting a 0.4% year-over-year decline. Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteNorthrop Grumman does not have the right combination for an earnings beat this season.

190,LLL,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.03%. Its Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to register substantial sales growth in the quarter under review. However, order flow is likely to fuel the company’s bottom-line growth.Let's see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Is Vertex Divesture a Prudent Move? Contract price modifications at Vertex Aerospace unit raised concern about L3 Technologies’ Aerospace Systems segment’s growth.  In fact, the company has identified this segment to be its most challenging business and remains skeptical about this unit’s growth rate as well as profitability.To focus its resources on higher value-added and more profitable business, the company decided to divest the Vertex Aerospace business, at the onset of the fourth quarter. However, the divesture is likely to drive the Aerospace Systems segment’s revenues in the long run and not have any impact in the fourth quarter.Management further added that several other financial pursuits of this segment will impact its 2018 sales growth. Therefore, the Aerospace Systems segment will most likely suffer a decline in sales year over year.Evidently, the Zacks consensus estimate for the segment’s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at $539 million reflecting an annual decline of 49.9%.Orders Growth ­– A Key CatalystA smooth order flow tends to boost the bottom line of defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Considering its encouraging order performance, the company’s enhanced its 2017 earnings guidance. Notably the company increased its EPS midpoint by 10 cents to $8.85, reflecting 8% growth over 2016.Primarily lower taxes and high interest income, along with the favorable contract performance in sensors and electronics businesses led the company to increase its full-year earnings guidance.Notably the Zacks consensus estimate for 2017 earnings is $8.38 per share, representing 2.1% annual rise.L-3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  L-3 Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. Quote Unimpressive Top-line Estimates ­It is imperative to mention that the top-line estimates for L3 Technologies, for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, are unlikely to register an annual improvement. The company’s fourth-quarter sales expectation of $2.8-$2.9 billion also reflects 6% decline in organic growth. Probably this prediction led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings of $2.31 per share to reflect 2.9% annual decline.For 2017, the company lowered its estimated international sales to organic decline of 7% and that's primarily due to new business delays taking place in aerospace systems unit.Will Communication Systems Unit Play a Spoilsport?L3 Technologies is currently consolidating two traveling wave tubes businesses in communication systems segment, which is scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018. As a result, this segment is incurring solid traveling wave tube business consolidation expenses, which may hamper its performance in the fourth quarter.In line with this, our consensus estimate for the unit’s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at $544 million, reflecting 6.5% annual decline.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not indicate that L3 Technologies will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of -2.04%.

191,LLL,"L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.'s (LLL  -  Free Report) share price has been on a big rally since bottoming out just above $87 in mid July. Since then, this stock has advanced above $106, a very impressive short-term gain of more than 20%. Much of the company's recent share strength comes on the heels of its excellent second-quarter results, reported on July 24.

"
212,LLL,"Analysts are upbeat on L-3. Eight out of 13 covering analysts hiked their full-year 2008 earnings forecast to a level of $6.57 per share, versus last months $6.50 and the two months-ago level of $6.48. The most accurate estimate is a more bullish $6.61. 
"
213,LLL,"The companys return on equity of (ROE) of 13% is in line with the industry average.
"
214,LLL,"One of the sectors I expected to deliver good third-quarter earnings was Aerospace, and based on the reports published so far, the companies within the sector are surpassing expectations. Per share earnings growth for Aerospace companies within the S&P 1500 Composite (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) is running at 27.4%. (The median company within the S&P 1500 Composite is reporting median per share earnings growth of 10.2%.)
"
215,LLL,"There are two primary reasons for the performance. The first is worldwide economic growth. Third-quarter GDP rose 3.9% in the third quarter, according to initial estimates. Growth in Asia and Europe remains stronger than here in the states. As a result, aviation traffic is up, both for commercial airlines and for corporate jets. The second is sustained defense spending, including homeland security. This not only impacts military jets, but weapons, ammunition and surveillance systems - much of which is made by companies within the aerospace sector.
"
216,LLL,"Often, we talk about an industry facing a headwind or benefiting from a tailwind. Given the large number of companies benefiting from the prevailing trends, the aerospace tailwind might be better described as a gust, bordering on a front. Among companies that brokerage analysts have raised 2007 and 2008 profit forecasts on following positive third-quarter earnings surprises are Flir Systems (FLIR  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), Goodrich (GR), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), L-3 Communications (LLL  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Precision Castparts (PCP). FLIR is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock, the others are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks.
"
217,LLL,"The one notable name missing from this group is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report). The reason for the company's absence from the group is its new jet, the 787 (aka the Dreamliner). BA pushed back the schedule for delivering the new jet because of delays in obtaining parts in addition to flight control software and systems integrations issues. Although this delay will not impact 2007 profits, it does adversely impact 2008 profits by postponing the timing of when revenues from the new jet will be recognized. More than half of the covering brokerage analysts recently cut their 2008 forecasts, causing a 21-cent drop in the consensus estimate to $5.98 per share.
"
218,LLL,"Given the proximity of 2008, the Zacks Rank is factoring in estimate revisions for both this year and next year. In the specific case of BA, estimates are up for 2007 and down for 2008, both of which contribute to the stock's Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") rating.
"
219,LLL,"BA, GD, LMT and NOC are classified in the Aerospace/Defense industry group. GR and PCP are classified in Aerospace/Defense Equipment. FLIR and LLL are classified in Electronics-Military Systems.
"
220,LLL,"Among the industry groups I did not expect to deliver impressive third-quarter earnings was Transportation-Trucking and my pessimism was correct. Spot rates have been under pressure because of slower economic growth, the purchase of new trucks ahead of the new environmental regulations that were enacted earlier this year and a loss of market share to rail. At the same time, fuel costs have been on the rise. Bluntly put, trucking companies are driving into headwinds.
"
221,LLL,"The impact of these headwinds was evident in the operating ratios of Con-way (CNW), Heartland Express (HTLD  -  Free Report) and Old Dominion (ODFL  -  Free Report). Operating ratios, which calculate  operating expenses as percentage of revenues, worsened for all three companies. Old Dominion's CEO, Earl Congdon, described the pricing environment as being ""increasingly competitive"" and Con-way's CEO, Douglas Stotlar, observed, ""the market continues to be very price sensitive"". Put another way, tonnage increased for both CNW and HTLD, but costs rose at a faster pace than revenues.
"
222,LLL,"Brokerage analysts lowered their 2007 and 2008 profit projections on all three companies following their earnings reports. Following the estimate revisions, CNW and HTLD are Zacks #4 Rank (""sell) stocks and ODFL is a Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stock.
"
223,LLL,"Worldwide economic expansion is helping technology product distributor Ingram Micro (IM). The company earned 41 cents per share during the third quarter, a 20% increase in profits. Brokerage analysts had forecast earnings of 39 cents per share. Revenues rose 15% to $8.61 billion thanks to strong demand from the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. The weak dollar did play a role, but the sales still rose even after accounting for currency translation.
"
224,LLL,"CEO Gregory Spierkel expects fourth-quarter revenues to set a record. He expects demand for technology products to remain strong in Europe and Asia-Pacific, particularly among small- to medium-sized businesses. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their 2007 and 2008 forecasts following IM's third-quarter report. The consensus earnings estimates now call for profits to reach $1.73 this year and $1.95 next year, versus $1.71 and $1.91 per share, respectively, last week.
"
225,LLL,"IM is a Zacks #2 Rank stock and is classified in Retail/Wholesale Computer. This group contains one other Zacks #2 Rank stock, Bell Microproducts.

However, as pre-announcements and actual reports of earnings continued to roll in through the end of May, the 1st quarter of 2004 actually beat the year ago period, as well as the stellar 3rd and 4th quarters of 2003, with earnings in excess of 30%. There is also little sign of the positive underlying business trends diminishing.
"
256,LLL,"Adam Oliensis, editor of the Agile Trader, tracks the earnings from both a fundamental and technical perspective. He notes that forward 52 week earnings estimates for the S&P 500 recently hit an all time high of $67.99/share. The S&P 500 currently trades at 16.69x that multiple and 18.7x the all time high trailing record operating earnings number. According to the Fair Value Fed Model, Oliensis research reveals a target of 1444 on the S&P 500.
"
257,LLL,"Oliensis uses the Fed Fair Value Model to determine the Risk Premium the market discounts to current earnings. Oliensis derives it by determining the Fed Fair Value, then inverting the equation to determine what yield on the 10-Year Treasury note would justify the current level of the S&P 500. His calculations yield a 1.28% risk premium. Over the last 43 years, the average Risk Premium has been 0.04%. Relative to the last 10 years, that reading is higher than 81% of the previous readings. Oliensis takes this to point toward a 5% yield on the 10-year note, but doubts that earnings expectations will pull back. In fact, Oliensis sees upside to the current estimate as he says that on average, earnings beat the final estimate for the quarter by about 3%, which could reveal a second quarter of 30% earnings growth.

258,LLL,"Jim Collins, editor of OTC Insight, is confident that earnings growth will remain at least in the double digits through the first quarter of 2005. Collins thinks, in addition to the earnings numbers posted by corporate America, the hiring trends convince him that the strength will continue and that pre-announcements will demonstrate positive trends and indications. As such, Collins recommends taking advantage of dips in attractive stocks that should rally throughout the rest of the summer.Top Picks
"
259,LLL,"Collins has a number of top growth plays, including Aetrium (NASDAQ:  ). The company designs, manufactures and markets a variety of electromechanical equipment used in the handling and testing of semiconductor and passive electronic devices, such as integrated circuits, or ICs, and discrete electronic components. Its products automate processes and improve manufacturing yields. For the first quarter, the company doubled revenues and turned to positive net income. Aetrium reached new highs in May and has a relative strength score of 99.

Hub Group contracts with railroads to provide transportation over the long-haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies for pickup and delivery.

261,LLL,"John Reese, editor of The Validea Hot List, feels the market has reached a sweet spot where it is comfortable with interest rate and inflation expectations are overshadowed by the impressive earnings numbers. Reeses most recent Hot List addition is OffShore Logistics (NYSE: OLG ), a provider of helicopter transportation services to the worldwide offshore oil and gas industry, with major operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. The stock passes Reeses strategies based on Peter Lynch and Ben Graham. The stock trades at an average 3-year p/e ratio of 13.3 and at only 1.3 times book value, thus meeting the major value requirements of the Graham strategy. In addition, its balance sheet looks strong, with long-term debt less than net current assets and a current ratio of 3.55. Although Graham was far from a growth investor, he did like to make sure that a company was showing positive long-term earnings growth. Offshore Logistics' total earnings growth over the past ten years of 118.5% easily meets the 30% minimum outlined by Graham. Valideas Lynch strategy also looks for stocks trading at attractive valuations, but Lynch defines value by looking at the company's p/e ratio in relation to its earnings growth rate. To pass the methodology, a stock must have a PEG ratio below 1.0. With a trailing 12-month p/e of around 11 and an average 5-year earnings growth rate of around 30%, the company easily meets the PEG requirement.

262,LLL,"L-3 Communications (NYSE: (LLL  -  Free Report) ) L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (L-3 Holdings) is a merchant supplier of secure communications and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, training, simulation and support services, aviation products and aircraft modernization, as well as specialized products. The stock passes Reeses interpretation of the strategies of Peter Lynch, James O'Shaughnessy and Martin Zweig. The stock trades at about 22 times earnings, which is below its 32% average 5-year earnings growth rate. addition, the company's inventory-to-sales has been falling, indicating it is becoming more efficient. For growth stocks, James O'Shaughnessy argues that the most important factors are market cap, earnings growth persistence, the price-to-sales ratio (which should be below 1.5) and relative strength -- the company must rank in the top 50 of the companies that pass the previous three criteria based on relative strength. L-3 meets the minimum market cap of $150 million, has grown earnings in each of the past five years and trades at only 1.25 times sales. It also has a relative strength of 66, indicating it has outperformed 66% of all other stocks in the past year. L-3s long-term earnings growth of 32% has been supported by a strong 37% growth in revenue. Earnings are also showing signs of an acceleration. Its 34% year over year growth rate for the current quarter is above both its long-term growth rate of 32% and its growth rate of 23% for the previous three quarters.
