1,RF,"Weak revenue and loan growth at Comerica (CMA) helped trigger a broad sell-off superregional banks like PNC Financial (PNC), Regions Financial (RF) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) while contributing to weak action among financials overall.Comerica's average total business loans for the quarter crept up to $48.4 billion from a year ago, but slipped from the fourth quarter.The company attributed the quarter-to-quarter dip to a ""seasonal decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance and a decrease in Corporate Banking, partially offset by an increase in National Dealer Services.""""Our pipeline is strong, and we expect loan growth to return with typical seasonality in the second quarter,"" CEO Ralph W.

2,RF,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak. REITs, utilities and other ""defensive stocks"" were not immune to the sell-offs.(A version of this column was first published on Dec. 12, 2016.)RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying PowerWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

24,RF,"LAS VEGAS – While finished products get most of the attention at the annual CES consumer electronics show, ""ingredient technologies"" are the unsung heroes, setting the stage for exciting new devices and services in the years ahead.X Two of those ""ingredient technologies"" being touted at CES 2018 are 5G wireless and artificial intelligence, officials say.""5G and AI are heralds for the coming data age,"" said Steve Koenig, senior director of research for the Consumer Technology Association, owner and sponsor of CES, which opened Tuesday and runs through Friday. ""CES is going to set the pace for that.""5G boasts fiber-like data speeds, low latency and the ability to support unlimited data plans. It will fuel new services and technologies such as the Internet of Things, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles and smart cities.With today's 4G wireless networks, consumers can download a two-hour movie in 6 minutes. With 5G that will take 3.6 seconds, Koenig said, going at speeds of 10 gigabits per second vs. 100 megabits per second with 4G.Wireless operators such as AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ) and China Mobile (CHL) are beginning to deploy 5G networks. Wireless-communications chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) is using CES to boast about its 5G expertise. Qualcomm shares were up fractionally Thursday to 65.43.Qualcomm is well positioned to continue its dominance in wireless chips because of the increasing complexity of mobile radio frequency chips and its ability to support numerous RF bands in devices, Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon said at a media briefing Monday. 5G will see an order of magnitude increase in combinations of wireless frequency bands vs. the current 4G standard, he said.""5G is a great, exciting opportunity because it is going to be a reality sooner than everybody thought,"" Amon said.

25,RF,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak.

""Some investors may conclude this relates to better sales momentum for the X, but we are increasingly concerned that demand has been below initial expectations as users appear to have gravitated toward previous iPhone models.""RELATED:Apple iPhone X Supply Improves In Time For ChristmasBroadcom Stock Reverses As Enthusiasm Fades Over Beat-And-Raise Report

Nvidia now needs to show it can rebound from the 50-day line.The tech-sector rout overshadowed a fine day for retail, finance and other sectors, where there were dozens of breakouts.Department stores, auto parts chains, office supply stores and supermarkets were the four best-performing industry groups in today's market.

31,RF,"Apple's (AAPL) 11th-generation smartphones could provide a lift for several chip companies, Wall Street analysts said Wednesday.Broadcom (AVGO), Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are among the chipmakers expected to benefit from the launch this fall of Apple's iPhone X and iPhone 8 series smartphones, which were unveiled Tuesday. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets are scheduled for release on Sept. 22, while the iPhone X (pronounced ""ten"") is due out on Nov. 3.Broadcom is the biggest direct beneficiary of the new Apple handsets, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said in a report.""We view the launch of the new iPhones as most positive for Broadcom with (its) content expected to increase 40% and with the number of chips increasing to eight from five,"" Vinh said. ""We believe the three additional chips will be needed for 3D touch, wireless charging, and RF (radio frequency).""Other chipmakers likely to increase their content in the new iPhones include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).Skyworks is seen making double-digit content gains in the new iPhones, while Qorvo makes single-digit gains, Vinh said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now includes seven chip industry players, including Skyworks Solutions.Cypress Semi is likely to get a boost from Apple's use of fast-charging technology in its new iPhones.""We view the enablement of fast charging in the new iPhones as positive for Cypress, as we anticipate content of 30 to 40 cents in each of the new iPhones,"" Vinh said. ""We currently do not anticipate the iPhones will ship with the fast-charging cable and block in the box, as these will be add-on accessories.""While the new iPhones likely have wireless-charging chips supplied by Broadcom, rival Integrated Device Technology is seen as benefiting from the overall smartphone industry adoption of wireless charging.IDT already has secured design wins from Chinese smartphone makers, who are predicted to follow Apple in adding wireless charging to their devices, Vinh said.Needham analyst Quinn Bolton concurred that IDT will be an indirect beneficiary of Apple's adoption of wireless charging.""We view Apple's support of Qi wireless charging as a significant positive for the inductive wireless charging ecosystem and we believe inductive wireless charging will likely become a check-box feature in most new premium smartphone platforms,"" Bolton said. ""As IDT is the undisputed market share leader in inductive wireless power, we expect IDT to capture a meaningful percentage of this 'fast-follower' business.""Of the bunch, IDT was the biggest winner on the stock market today.IDT shares broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 27.19, and jumped more than 6% at one point.

""After a two-month consolidation in the stock, Broadcom is poised to move sharply higher as these catalysts play out.""Wall Street is underestimating Broadcom's wireless business in the second half of the year, Hettenbach said.Most notably, Broadcom's chip content in Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 is expected to be 40% higher than the current generation.""In addition to increasing content in Broadcom's core pieces of RF (radio frequency) and connectivity, we think the company is picking up new (iPhone) content in custom applications, including touch and wireless charging,"" he said.However, the share of Broadcom's revenue coming from Apple is approaching 20%, which presents a risk of becoming too reliant on one big customer, he said.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore kept his underweight rating on Maxim stock, but upped his price target to 40 from 37 ahead of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, due out late Thursday.Maxim stock finished the regular trading session down 0.3% to 46.94.""Maxim is the first broad-based analog (chip) company to report (this earnings season) and given the investment community is debating the strength and sustainability of the semi cycle, it will be watched closely,"" Moore said in a report.""Things we will be watching for on the earnings call include: Growth in autos following commentary last quarter of a slowing, discussion on lead times and inventory levels in the distribution channel, the magnitude of strength in the industrial end market, and trends in the company's smartphone business,"" Moore said.Needham analyst Quinn Bolton lowered his price target on MaxLinear stock to 32 from 34, but kept his buy rating.MaxLinear shares lost more than 7% at the close to finish at 26.72.""We are proactively reducing our second-half 2017 and 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates on MaxLinear as we believe the company's optical business is not likely to recover in Q3 2017 and we now forecast MaxLinear's optical revenue will decline by over 20% year over year in 2017,"" Bolton said in a report.

Oppenheimer increased its price target to 100 from 90 and kept its outperform rating. Pacific Crest Securities hiked its target to 103 from 98 and maintained its overweight rating.Analog Devices finished the trading day down 4.1% to 82.21 on the stock market today. The stock fell below its recent buy point of 84.34 from a cup base. ADI shares jumped to a 17-year high of 90.49 intraday on Wednesday.Analog Devices is attractive because of its presence in the automotive-chip market and synergies from its recent acquisition of Linear Technology, said Pacific Crest Michael McConnell said in a note to clients.But ADI faces challenges in its consumer-chip business, losing content in Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8.Camarillo, Calif.-based Semtech late Wednesday posted mixed results for its fiscal first quarter, but gave healthy guidance.Semtech earned 44 cents a share excluding items, up 47% year over year, on sales of $143.8 million, up 10%, in the quarter ended April 30.

37,RF,"Apple (AAPL) is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency chips for iPhones, making it less likely Broadcom (AVGO),  Qorvo (QRVO), or Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) could be displaced by the iPhone maker, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst.While Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh says Apple also is unlikely to develop its own audio chips — a plus for Cirrus Logic (CRUS) — he speculates that Synaptics (SYNA) could be at risk of losing business. San Jose-based Synaptics makes chips that control iPhone displays.Shares in Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, and Skyworks fell on Tuesday after a report that Apple will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. That report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors Apple that was phasing out its graphics chips in iPhones.""In light of concerns over Imagination Technologies graphics chips and Dialog Semiconductor power management chips being insourced at Apple, we believe the risk of Synaptics being displaced is medium to high, while we see risk of RF suppliers and Cirrus Logic being integrated as medium to low,"" Vinh said in a report. ""We believe the risk that RF semiconductors would be insourced is low, given high technical barriers to entry and protection of intellectual property.""Dialog stock fell 14% on Tuesday in Germany. Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe downgraded Dialog to ""sell"" saying that Apple is working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone.Expectations for a strong iPhone upgrade cycle in late 2017 had been rising, sending chip stocks up.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Nvidia and Inphi are the top-rated stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Apple as well as rival Samsung have been developing their own in-house microprocessors to perform the heavy-duty in smartphones.""We think Samsung looks to integrate semiconductors to save costs, but Apple is different as it only looks to integrate components if it believes it can get performance benefits to differentiate its products,"" added the Pacific Crest analyst.Shares in Apple were up 17 cents to 141.80 at the close on the stock market today. Broadcom stock lost 3.8% to 209.20, Cirrus Logic stock fell 2.3% to 61.91 and Skyworks stock slipped 2.6% to 97.59.

""Broadcom has a dominant position in multiple markets that are benefiting from secular trends, and the company's pricing discipline is adding to incremental growth.""He set a 12-month price target of 265 on Broadcom stock. Shares dipped 0.5% to close at 218.96 on the stock market today. Broadcom shares hit an all-time high of 227.75 on March 13.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes 10 chip industry stocks, including Cavium, Nvidia and Qorvo.Macquarie likes Cavium because of its position in cloud computing, data center, security and wireless infrastructure markets. It set a price target of 85 on the company. Cavium stock was up a fraction, and closed at 71.66 Friday.Pajjuri rates Nvidia and Qorvo neutral because of valuation.""Nvidia is the best secular growth story in large-cap semis given its leadership position in high-growth markets including gaming, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and autonomous cars,"" Pajjuri said. ""Margin execution and cash returns have also been solid. While the company's longer-term prospects are promising, near-term upside to estimates appears limited, particularly in gaming and automotive markets.""He has a price target on Nvidia of 110. Nvidia dipped 0.4% to close at 108.93.Pajjuri also sees limited upside for Qorvo stock at its current level. He has a price target on Qorvo of 70. It was down 0.8% to 68.56 at the close Friday.""Qorvo is a leading supplier of radio frequency (RF) components, a sub-segment benefiting from secular content expansion in smartphones,"" he said. ""The upcoming iPhone 7S/X cycle could drive some upside given the company's 35-40% exposure to Apple (AAPL).

39,RF,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell slightly in Sunday evening trading. Dow futures edged down 0.1% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.2%.The major averages all rose slightly in the past week, with the Nasdaq composite briefly setting an all-time high on Friday.But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow industrials components, retreated last week, along with Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and a slew of other banks. Several bank stocks, notably Goldman and Morgan Stanley, are testing their 50-day moving averages.The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal faster interest rate hikes after Wednesday's expected quarter-point increase buoyed most stocks. But banks sold off as Treasury yields fell, especially at the high end. Lower yields and a flatter curve between short- and long-term maturities hurts banks' borrow short, lend long profit model.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks often are sensitive to interest rates swings, but not all: Here's a big-cap financial stock that in buy range now.JPMorgan, which gapped up at the beginning of March as investors priced in the March 15 Fed hike, fell about 1% in Friday stock market trading, essentially at its lowest levels of the month, but still not too close to its rising 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs sank 1.7% to 243.92 on Friday, closing just above its 50-day line. So did the other big pure-play investment bank Morgan Stanley, which retreated 2.8% Friday.Bank of America sank 1.4% on Friday, but is comfortably above its 50-day line. BofA tested its 50-day in early February, then had a solid advance through March 1.Citigroup, which was one of the few big banks to trade below its 50-day line earlier this year, fell 1.3% to 60.37 on Friday. Citigroup crossed a 61.73 buy point several times this month, but never closed above that level.PNC Financial (PNC) is approaching its 50-day line, Regions Financial (RF) briefly undercut that level on Friday, while BB&T Corp. (BBT), Keycorp (KEY) and Suntrust Financial (STI) all closed the week below that support area.Keep in mind that in most of these cases, the stock are not far multi-year highs.In Asian Monday intraday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose to its best levels since 2015. Stocks also edged higher in China, while falling in Australia and South Korea. Japan's Nikkei was closed for Monday.RELATED:These Are The 5 Biggest S&P 500 Stocks In Buy Range NowThe Big Picture: 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Points

40,RF,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

But it ranks No. 3 out of 38 companies in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Qorvo stock rose 1.6% to 68.95 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer has soured on Intel since it announced a $15.3 billion deal to buy autonomous car tech firm Mobileye (MBLY).Intel on Monday agreed to pay $63.54 a share in cash for Mobileye, which is a 34% premium to Mobileye's closing price on Friday.Pitzer lowered his price target on Intel stock to 35 from 45. Intel fell 0.2% to 35.10 on Wednesday.""While we are one of few that actually like the Mobileye transaction, we continue to struggle with an investment time horizon inside of Intel, which is not compatible with most our clients and the opportunity cost of owning Intel over other (semiconductor stocks),"" he said in a report.RELATED:Nvidia Working On Mass Market Self-Driving Car System With BoschAs Chip Gear Makers Hit New Highs, Analyst Sees A PullbackAnalog Devices, Marvell, ON Semi Get Price-Target Hikes

Broadcom ended the day up 1%, at 217.29.Late Wednesday, Broadcom, a key supplier to Apple (AAPL), reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 29 and guided to sales above forecasts for the current quarter.Broadcom posted adjusted earnings of $3.63 a share, up 51% year over year, on sales of $4.15 billion, up 133%. Analysts were expecting Broadcom to report adjusted earnings of $3.48 a share on sales of $4.08 billion. It was the company's fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales and earnings growth. Much of Broadcom's year-over-year growth is related to its merger last year with Avago.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock is ranked No. 17 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It is one of seven chip-industry stocks on the list. Others include Nvidia and Microchip Technology.For the current quarter, Broadcom expects sales of $4.09 billion. It did not give an earnings target. Wall Street has been modeling Broadcom to post adjusted earnings of $3.22 a share, up 27%, on sales of $3.9 billion, up 10%, in its fiscal second quarter.Broadcom is a leading designer of digital and analog semiconductors. It serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial.At least 10 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on Broadcom stock after the company's first-quarter report.""We view Broadcom as the (chip) group's best self-help story with multiple levers for earnings-per-share and free-cash-flow upside driving industry-leading capital return and margin profile in addition to its organically growing top line,"" Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a report. ""As arguably the group's best consolidator, we believe Broadcom has ample dry powder for M&A and to further boost capital returns.""Schafer rates Broadcom stock as outperform with a 12- to 18-month price target of 240.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his ""top pick"" rating on Broadcom and raised his price target to 240 from 230.He sees Broadcom ""benefiting from a confluence of multiple tailwinds over the next few quarters."" They include a content uptick in Samsung smartphones, sustained growth in wired infrastructure, and continued operating expense control and gross profit margin expansion.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland maintained his positive rating on Broadcom and upped his price target to 250 from 220.""Exemplified by another beat and raise, we continue to view Broadcom as the must own large cap in semis as they prove some companies deserve to be 'over-loved,' "" he said in a report.Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh stuck with his overweight rating on Broadcom and raised his price target to 255 from 215.""Upside was once again driven by extremely robust enterprise storage demand, while content gains in the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 resulted in better guidance,"" Vinh said in a report. ""Broadcom posted impressive results, but we believe the best is still yet to come in second-half fiscal 2017, as we anticipate meaningful content gains in the upcoming iPhone 8 from RF, Wi-Fi and wireless charging, while Intel's (INTC) Purley should help drive growth in the switching and routing business.""RELATED:Ambarella, Micron, Marvell Upgraded; Intel, Cirrus Logic Downgraded

45,RF,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) leads Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, industry tracker iFixit found Thursday in a teardown of Samsung's newest phablet.Qualcomm boasts six chips inside the latest of ""Samsung's line of phones-that-don't-fit-in-your-pocket,"" iFixit wrote in a teardown report. The Galaxy Note 7 touts an Apple iPhone 6S-quashing battery. But its power falls short of the Galaxy S7 Edge.Among Qualcomm's offerings -- a processor, an audio codec, two radio-frequency chips and two power management chips. Fellow RF Qorvo chipmaker brings three chips to the mix: a high-band RF fusion module, a front-end module and a receiver.IBD'S TAKE: Dot-com boom darling Qualcomm sports a fast-growing dividend. Check out IBD's Dividend Leaders.Broadcom has at least one confirmed chip, but its Wi-Fi system-on-a-chip is also likely contained within Samsung's Wi-Fi module, iFixit found. Samsung itself supplies two other chips for flash memory and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).Integrated Device Technology supplied a wireless power receiver, an iteration of the component it supplies for the Apple Watch.The chipset is nearly identical to those of the S7 and S7 Edge, iFixit found. The Note 7 scored a four out of a best-possible 10 in repairability. Many of the components can be replaced independently, but the chassis is vulnerable to cracking.Noted iFixit, ""Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the display is probably impossible.""In afternoon tradingIntegrated Device Technology stock closed up 3.25% on the stock market today, and Qorvo rose 1.2%.

46,RF,"Taiwan's Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) has emerged as a strong leader in the fabless semiconductor design industry group.So, with a market cap of $1.9 billion, does the stock still have room to grow?Intuitively, it's easy to say yes. The largest stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor fabless group, Qualcomm (QCOM), the darling tech of 1999 that topped just before the mighty 2000 Nasdaq tech crash, carries a value of more than $90 billion. That's in the big-cap leagues. Silicon Motion arguably would have to more than double in price just to be considered for midcap status.However, the savvy investor knows that no stock has the right to grow in size, especially in an age of sober exuberance as we may be witnessing in the U.S. stock market today. Every company must earn it.On the earnings front, Silicon Motion earns it. On an annual basis, profit has risen from 44 cents a share in 2010 to $2.11 in 2015. The company's EPS estimates look swell, up 55% to $3.26 a share in 2016, and up 17% to $3.83 in 2017.You can't have great earnings without great sales, and Silicon Motion earns it again. Revenue plummeted 20% in 2013, reflecting the highly cyclical nature of semiconductor companies. But they revved 28% higher in 2014, and 25% higher in 2015 to $361 million.Silicon Motion specializes in two niches: flash memory-based controllers for solid-state storage devices, and specialty radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits for internet-enabled mobile devices. Given the growth of online video and mobile internet, Silicon Motion is definitely in a sweet spot.A company cannot grow in size without a few more factors. Ask yourself: Is a company attracting stronger demand from the institutional crowd? Certainly so for Silicon Motion. The stock's average volume is institutional quality at 571,000 shares on average a day, rising from 400,000 at the start of 2015. Plus, the fund sponsorship has recently eclipsed the 200-fund mark.Should you go out and buy shares, then metaphorically go to sleep for two to three years? No. A lot can happen over that time. Use chart analysis to determine the right entry point.For now, Silicon Motion is extended from a proper buy point. On March 11, the stock broke out and began its relatively smooth glide past a 34.10 entry within a three-month cup with handle in fast trading. That base was nestled within a much larger, deeper base that was first-stage. Why was it first-stage? The low of the deep base, 20.01, undercut the low of the prior cup that formed from September 2014 to January 2015.Over the next four months, it catapulted 64% in price to as high as 56.21. Now it's taking a pit stop. Watch for a new base to potentially form. Remember, it just takes a minimum five weeks to form a flat base and six to mold a cup.On Wednesday, Silicon Motion shares rose 0.3% in very quiet turnover to 54.31.IBD'S TAKE: Never heard of the flat base?

49,RF,"Stocks fell at Tuesday's open and remained lower through the day as comments made in London and New York took a toll on the day's trade.The Nasdaq dropped 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% apiece.  Small caps took harder hits than the overall market, leaving the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.U.S. traders took some cues from London, where stocks dropped hard after Prime Minister Theresa May announced Britain would seek to renegotiate its trade agreements outside the European Union's single-market trade protocol.  The statement of fortified independence sent the pound to its biggest gain since 2008, while London's FTSE 100 equity index shed 1.5%. The CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.5%, while Frankfurt's DAX kept to a 0.1% decline.In afternoon trade, 141 of IBD's 197 industry groups moved lower. Superregional banks fell furthest, trading lower after President-elect Donald Trump signaled opposition to a key piece of the GOP's tax strategy.Comerica (CMA) was hardest hit in the group, down 7%. The Dallas-based bank reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst targets. The stock had been holding steady just below a Jan. 5 high, but dropped to test support at its 10-week moving average. Regions Financial (RF) and SVB Financial Group (SIVB) fell more than 5% each.IBD 50 stock Arista Networks (ANET) led the computer networking group to the day's second-worst loss among industries.  Shares fell 12% in huge trade after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency said it would reinstate an import ban on Arista switches pending further review. The tumble broke support at the stock's 10-week moving average in heavy trade and erased effectively all of its gain since clearing a flat base in November. Both moves are sell signals.Some of the day's strongest moves came from gold miners, as a pullback in the dollar helped boost gold prices more than 1%. A long list of miners — including Anglogold Ashanti (AU), Sibanye Gold (SBGL) and IamGold (IAG) — gained more than 2%.Noble Energy (NBL) topped the S&P 500, rallying 7% after agreeing to buy Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) in a $2.7 billion deal. The deal gives Noble leases to 120,000 net acres in a key region of West Texas' prolific Permian Basin shale play, as well as a number of pipelines serving that region.  Noble is holding support in the fifth week of a flat consolidation. Clayton Williams shares spiked 40%, putting the stock just below its May 2014 high.After the close, investors have an eye on earnings reports due out from Netflix (NFLX) and chip equipment maker ASML  Holding (ASML).Also after the close, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams is scheduled to speak at 6 p.m. ET.RELATED:Goldman, Citi, Retail Brokerages; Investing Action PlanBank Stock Losses Intensify After Trump Rips GOP Tax Plan

53,RF,"Big-cap techs powered the market higher during late afternoon trading Friday and the Nasdaq led the way, rising nearly 0.7% and notching all-time highs, as its largest member by market cap looked poised for a fresh breakout from a new base.Apple (AAPL) has no doubt become a mature income play (it has a 2% annualized yield), but the mega-cap consumer stock is still showing signs of growth left in the tank.As noted in a Stock Market Today column Thursday, the company is poised to reignite an acceptable rebound in revenues, which could put Apple back on track for renewed profit growth.Apple has seen profits wither vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters, down 18%, 15% and 23%. Fiscal Q1 profit is seen down just 2%, though, to $3.22 a share. The stock, up 1.1% to 117.91, is trying to move past a 118.12 buy point in a 12-week cup-with-handle base following news of a pay cut for CEO Tim Cook. Shares have so far gotten as high as 118.16.The buy point is found by adding 10 cents to the handle's intraday high of 118.02. The handle began forming its six-day handle on Dec. 28.Watch to see how Apple's volume finishes by day's end. While it's higher than Thursday's session, you'd prefer to see volume grow sharply above its 50-day average (currently 32.3 million shares a day) if and when the breakout occurs. In some rare cases, volume doesn't come in big until days or weeks after the actual piercing of the correct entry price.The tech-rich Nasdaq 100, which houses the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose  as much as 1.1%, better than gains of nearly 0.5% by the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500.Investment bank, super regional bank, medical software, railroad, oil drilling, travel booking, desktop software, internet content and security software firms paced the market's upside as these industry groups all throttled 1% higher or more. Gold miners fell hard, down more than 5% as a group. Coal, steel and water utility stocks also slumped.Small cap names lagged, with the Russell 2000 losing modest gains and falling 0.2. Volume is running lower on the NYSE with less than 30 minutes left in Friday's session and higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Thursday.While the U.S. payrolls increase of 156,000 jobs in December missed a consensus view of 178,000, investors shrugged off the miss and decided to embrace the better than expected jump in wages, up 0.4% vs. an expected 0.3% increase.While some observers noted that the report likely gave members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting FOMC committee a feeling of justification in raising interest rates last month, others wondered whether it would lead to a change in thinking on how much more labor participation is possible and how it could impact future economic growth and overall inflation.""The payroll report asks more questions than it answers. Specifically, have we reached full employment; is this as good as it gets?"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD.Banking stocks are helping lead the rally; Goldman Sachs (GS), part of IBD Leaderboard, jumped 1.7% to 245.32. Leaderboard, which features charts that are annotated in real time to help readers discover signs of strength and weakness and proper buy and sell signals, currently shows 11 names on its Leaders list.Super regional lenders Regions Financial (RF) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) were up 0.6% and 1%, respectively. Both have been trading in tight price ranges, a bullish sign following excellent breakouts (10.18 entry for Regions, 21.21 for Fifth Third) that preceded big run-ups from October through December of last year.The Federal Reserve has signaled that it may raise the fed funds rate three more times in 2017, reflecting confidence in the overall U.S. economy.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker had climbed nearly 8% following its latest breakout, a Sept. 14 move past a 110.33 entry in a 12-week cup with handle that formed amidst its bottoming process. A bottoming base pattern emerges when a stock makes a dramatic decline of 30%, 40% or more, then breaks a long-term downtrend line.Apple got as high as 118.69 before fading on concerns of Apple Watch and iPhone 7 model unit sales. However, as seen in the daily chart, the stock showed a terrific bounce off the 200-day moving average, a good shakeout that helped set the course for the creation of the right side of a new base.For fiscal 2017, which ends in September this year, the Street expects Apple's earnings to grow 8% to $8.99 a share, then accelerate to a 12% increase to $10.08 a share in FY 2019.Apple has 5.33 billion shares outstanding and a float of 5.28 billion. Elsewhere in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA), gaining much attention at the CES 2017 show in Las Vegas, rallied 2.7% to 103.51 as it attempts to put the brakes on a new correction.At the end of December, the leading designer of chips for graphics, data center, VR and artificial intelligence research staged a climax run, hinting that it was in need of a break.At its recent low of 99.38, Nvidia has fallen 17% below its all-time peak of 119.93.

55,RF,"It seems Broadcom (AVGO) just can't resist making merger deals -- whether joining forces with another company or shedding some of its own operations.The supplier to Apple (AAPL) iPhones seemed set after making its mammoth $37 billion deal to merge with Avago earlier this year. In March, a mere month after the transaction closed, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan spurned any talk of future transactions. Tan told analysts a merger or acquisition was the ""furthest thing"" from his mind.That was then. Tan's tune changed a couple months later when he told analysts on the June 2 second-quarter conference call that Broadcom will pull excess cash for mergers, as gross debt is close to double its adjusted earnings. Broadcom, the No. 2 fabless chipmaker, is still trying to buffer itself from volatile smartphone sales and angle for the more stable wired segment.Analysts say the merger strategy is working. Morgan Stanley's Craig Hettenbach notes the company now has greater diversification, with a hand in wireless, wired, enterprise storage and industrial segments.""The ebb and flow between Broadcom's end markets has allowed the company to meet revenue expectations in recent quarters despite the overriding demand weakness that has had a negative impact on most peers,"" Hettenbach wrote in a June 3 research report.Broadcom is far from new to the merger block. In fact, the company has changed hands several times itself since it was founded in 1961 as a semiconductor division under Hewlett-Packard. It left when Agilent Technologies (A) split from the company in 1999.Six years later, KKR and Silver Lake paid $2.6 billion to acquire the division of Agilent that later became Avago. Before going public in 2009, Avago sold one of its divisions to PMC-Sierra. PMC, in turn, was acquired early this year by Microsemi (MSCC).Eight years of rampant merger deals followed. In 2013, Avago acquired optical chip supplier CyOptics for $400 million and storage/networking firm LSI for $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Avago peeled off several layers of its own by selling divisions to Intel (INTC) and Seagate Technology (STX). Then it turned the tables and bought Emulex in 2015 for $606 million.Earlier this year, Broadcom divested its Internet of Things and wireless infrastructure units to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and MaxLinear (MXL) in deals worth a combined $630 million. Broadcom is likely to use those proceeds to pay down debt before seeking another deal.But the Big Kahuna was Avago's merger with the former Broadcom. That acquisition wrapped in February and was one of a number of chip-sector deals worth a cumulative $115 billion. (Intel bought Altera for $17 billion, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) took on Freescale Semiconductors for $12 billion.)Combined, the new company kept Broadcom's name but used Avago's ticker, AVGO. The move helped it to diversify, and analysts thus changed their tune on the stock. In 2017, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expects Broadcom to make a play for larger assets like Maxim Integrated (MXIM), NXP or Xilinx (XLNX).At least 16 analysts rated Broadcom stock a buy in the week following its Q2 earnings release, the first quarter in which the two companies were consolidated. Meanwhile, shareholders busted Broadcom stock out of a cup formation on June 3. Shares rocketed 7.7% before dipping almost immediately into a second cup. Broadcom stock topped a 166 entry point on July 27, but it has since pulled back.Broadcom shares ended Friday trading at a new all-time high of 170.12, up 1.9%, but lost some ground Monday. Shares finished Monday's trades down 1% to 168.35.Wireless sales accounted for a mere 22% of total revenue -- dipping below 30% for the first time in seven quarters. Broadcom's smartphone-facing unit accounted for 37% of sales in 2015. In 2014 and 2013, wireless revenue was 42% and 49% of total sales.Despite slowing importance to Broadcom's overall scheme, Tan hinted that radio-frequency content for smartphones has increased and would likely continue to rise by 20% annually for the next two to three years. That means even as smartphone units slow, Broadcom could see its take per phone grow.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom tops IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 20 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 74 two months ago. Get Broadcom's IBD Stock Checkup here.UBS analyst Stephen Chin estimates that Broadcom could see its dollar content per unit boost to $8-$10 in the long term. Growth will come from additional content at existing tier-one smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung and as more infrastructure comes online to support 4G and LTE devices worldwide.""This could drive the need for additional FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filters,"" Chin wrote in a July 15 research report. FBAR filters are a common component used in advanced smartphones. The filters account for about 12% of Broadcom's sales, Chin estimated.Broadcom's three-year agreement with Apple for chips ""suggests it will remain the FBAR market leader,"" Chin said. In a July 8 note to clients, RBC's Daryanani estimated that Broadcom's Apple-tied sales could grow more than 15% over the next three years.Diversification is key for RF suppliers like Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), which are jockeying for position as mobile sales stagnate. Vendors shipped 343.3 million smartphones in the second quarter, flat vs. last year, industry tracker IDC wrote in a July 28 note. Sequentially, smartphone shipments were up 3.1% from the first quarter.Still, mobile giants like Apple are changing their game to focus on services, IDC analyst Ryan Reith says. As smartphone makers shift strategies, so too do chipmakers.For Broadcom that means greater emphasis on its wired segment, which made up 58% of sales in the second quarter, accelerating from 22% of sales in the first quarter. Its previous three-year quarterly average in that unit was 22% of sales. Broadcom has beat Wall Street's total sales expectations for the past seven quarters.Broadcom's wired unit is largely enterprise-facing. The segment includes Broadcom's Tomahawk chips for cloud-scale networking and its Jericho platform for routing. Jericho will drive additional upside to top-line expectations for the third quarter, UBS' Chin said.""We estimate Jericho has started ramping recently and there is virtually no alternative chip supplier in the market,"" he wrote. ""The main competition is from networking OEM internal ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) designs.""

56,RF,"Major stock indexes capped the week with solid gains Friday, helped by news of robust job growth in July.Merck (MRK) was the best percentage gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, rising 10%, followed by financials like JPMorgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which showed gains of better than 2%.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to a record close. The S&P 500 also marked an all-time closing high, up 0.9% and the Dow picked up 1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Thursday's levels. Volume on the NYSE was slightly lower.Merck was a beneficiary of bad news from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). The latter crashed 16% after its blockbuster drug Opdivo, already approved to treat some forms of cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint. Merck's competing drug Keytruda succeeded in a similar trial recently.IBD's super regional banks group was one of the day's top performers, rising more than 3%. Big gainers included SVB Financial (SIVB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF). Utilities lagged across the board.Meanwhile, the economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of robust job growth.Despite the strong data, fed funds futures traders still aren't optimistic about a rate hike in September. According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, the odds for a September hike are currently around 18% but rise to 40% at the December meeting.Gold slumped and treasury yields jumped on the jobs data. Gold for December delivery settled at $1,344.40 an ounce, down $23 or 1.7%.

It gapped up over a 1,367.09 buy point, rising 4%.Leaderboard member Monster Beverage (MNST) added 2.5%. Earnings per share reported late Thursday missed expectations, but sales growth accelerated nicely from the prior quarter, rising 19% to $827.5 million.Monster was in buy range from a 154.06 buy point ahead of the results, but the stock is slightly extended now.IBD'S TAKE: Two stocks in Monster's industry group, Beverages-Non-Alcoholic, have higher Composite Ratings than Monster.

57,RF,"Qorvo (QRVO) reacted faster than most to slow sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S and took market share from rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in the upcoming iPhone 7, analysts said, but gross profit margins last quarter and this quarter speak of challenges ahead, and Qorvo stock fell sharply Wednesday despite its earnings beat last Tuesday.Qorvo stock tumbled 10.3% to 55.12 in the stock market today, tumbling below its 50-day average. The stock briefly fell back in a buy zone from a cup-with-handle breakout on June 1 at a 52.05 buy point. Since then, however, shares rose as high as 64.80 on July 27, a 52-week high, up 24.5% from the buy point and well past the 20% gains at which investors are advised to lock in at least some profits.Late Tuesday, Qorvo reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share minus items for its fiscal Q1 ended July 2, and its guidance for the current quarter also beat Wall Street views, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo ranks No. 4 in its big industry group, with a Composite Rating of 91 that puts it among the top 9% of all stocks in key metrics like sales growth. Earnings growth, however, is its one red flag, as you can learn at IBD Stock Checkup.But the company's Q1 gross margin minus items of 48.2% missed views for 50.1%, and its margin guidance for the current quarter also fell short.Qorvo sales did better than expected in China, analysts said, but the weak profit margin was ""due to poor yields on quadplexers being shipped into Chinese smartphones,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a research note late Tuesday. ""Qorvo cited lower SAW filter yields as the primary culprit,"" but is taking remedies to fix the problem.Quadplexers and SAW (surface acoustic wave) filters are used to eliminate radio frequency interference in mobile communications. Qorvo is a leading provider of RF chips for smartphones and other devices.Vinh also wrote that ""Qorvo reaffirmed expectations for content growth in the iPhone 7,"" and that it had ""faced the iPhone 6S inventory correction earlier than its peers,"" but he maintained a sector weight rating on Qorvo stock.Qorvo's solid guidance ""confirms our belief that Qorvo has taken market share from Skyworks in the iPhone 7,"" wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang in a research note Wednesday.""We believe it is a positive sign that Qorvo has taken market share in the iPhone 7, but on the other hand, Qorvo might face more volatility over the next two quarters due to our cautiousness on overall iPhone sales,"" Zhang said. ""We are mid-term positive on Qorvo as we expect their BAW (bulk acoustic wave) and SAW filter products to ramp, but in the near run, the increasing smartphone supply chain headwinds from China's inventory correction bring equal risk to all smartphone components.""Apple stock rose 1.25% to 105.79.

58,RF,"Late Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is expected to report fiscal Q1 sales and earnings that toppled into the red vs. last year, but shares dawdled Monday for a fourth straight day, extended at least 20% from a buy point, a zone at which investors might want to lock in at least some profits.Qorvo stock is 21% extended from a 52.05 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation achieved June 1. Shares rose 24% in 2016 year to date through Friday, and they closed up 0.4% at 63.47 on the stock market today.The company created from the January 2015 merger of TriQuint Semiconductor and RF Micro Devices is slated to report fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday. Analysts expect Qorvo to report $650.6 million in sales and $1.05 earnings per share ex items, each metric down 4% from the year-earlier period.Qorvo has guided to $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS ex items.Sales declined for the first time in eight quarters in fiscal Q4, ended in March. And EPS fell for the second consecutive period. Analysts expect both metrics to re-accelerate and grow in fiscal Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it performs in the top 11% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. IBD's 38-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is ranked No. 70 out of 197 groups tracked, climbing from No. 163 over two months.Last month, a Mizuho analyst predicted Intel (INTC) would source a third of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, displacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM) in some units. That would benefit Qorvo but hurt Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), said the Mizuho report.Qorvo has a ""legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips.

59,RF,"Stocks quickly surrendered early gains Thursday, then retreated to deepening losses in the final session before the transition of power in the U.S. presidency.The Dow Jones industrial average ended the session down 0.4%, slipping into negative territory for the year. The S&P 500 also shed 0.4%, while the Nasdaq notched a 0.3% decline.Bond yields ran higher, the dollar was mixed and oil prices edged up, with West Texas intermediate largely staying put between $51 and $52 per barrel.After the close, IBM (IBM) beat sales and profit expectations and its guidance was above views, too. But the stock fell ,more than 2% in extended trading. The stock is in buy range from the 161.96 buy point of cup with handle.American Express (AXP) was down slightly after the close following the company's earnings release. Results were mixed although management gave a bullish outlook.Among the day's more breathtaking moves, railroad CSX (CSX) gapped up and surged to a 23% gain in massive trade. Outgoing Canadian Pacific (CP) CEO Hunter Harrison will reportedly step down five months earlier than planned and team up with activist investor Paul Hilal to try to put Harrison in a top management post at CSX, according to a Wednesday report from the Wall Street Journal. After Thursday's gap up, the stock is extended from a rebound off its 10-week moving average, but the strong action is a bullish sign.Fiber-optic gear maker Oclaro (OCLR) was also a big winner, soaring 17% after reporting preliminary revenue and operating income above prior guidance. The move punched shares back above their 10-week moving average, placing them well up the right side of a base begun in November.Tesla Motors (TSLA) climbed 2% in quick trade, scaling up the right side of a base with a 269.44 potential buy point. Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the electric car maker to overweight with a 305 price target.In a holiday-shortened week buffeted by pre-inauguration volatility and news bytes out of Congressional hearings of incoming administration Cabinet picks, tobacco, automakers and shipping fleets have thus far posted the strongest moves among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.A heavy-volume, 10% fall by Atlanta-based Aaron's (AAN) dragged consumer electronics retailers to the week's worst performance among industries. Raymond James reduced its rating on Aaron's to market perform from strong buy.The No. 1-ranked industry group, super regional banks, is also among the week's hardest hit, with Northern Trust (NTRS) down more than 7%, and SVB Financial (SIVB), Regions Financial (RF) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) down more than 4% apiece.On Friday, the economic calendar is pretty bare with just the Baker-Hughes rig count coming out at 1 p.m. ET. General Electric (GE) is the biggest company reporting earnings. Analysts expect an 11.5% drop in EPS. Oil services provider Schlumberger (SLB) also reports.RELATED:Housing Starts, Philly Fed Index Jump; Jobless Claims Dive

60,RF,"Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is expected to post its third quarter in a row of declining sales and earnings when it reports fiscal first-quarter results after the market close Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Woburn, Mass.-based Skyworks to earn $1.58 per share excluding items, down 1.3% year over year, on sales of $903 million, down 2.6%, in the December quarter.Skyworks is expected to return to growth in the current quarter, its fiscal Q2. Wall Street is modeling Skyworks to earn $1.39 a share ex items, up 11%, on sales of $818 million, up 5.5%, in the March quarter.Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer on Monday reiterated his outperform rating and 100 price target on Skyworks stock.IBD'S TAKE: Skyworks Solutions stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 73, meaning it has outperformed 73% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 19 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Skyworks stock fell 1.8% to 76.89 on the stock market today, and it's traded in a narrow range the past three months.Schafer expects Skyworks to beat consensus for Q1 and guide to in-line or better results for Q2.""Seasonally, we don't expect a repeat of 2016 which saw heavy iPhone 6S inventory overbuild weigh on results,"" he said in a research report. ""Following March guidance, we expect investors to begin to position themselves for the iPhone 8 release in September, where we see Skyworks extending its record of content gains.""Apple (AAPL) is Skyworks' top customer, accounting for about 40% of revenue, Schafer said.""We believe Skyworks' growth trajectory remains on track to benefit from increasing RF (radio frequency) complexity, with relatively easy year-over-year comparisons heading into calendar 2017,"" he said.Skyworks makes analog semiconductors for wireless networking. Its chips are used in communications, automotive, industrial, medical, military and other applications.

"
63,RF,"Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem owe much of their torrid growth to the 3G and 4G wireless networks that whisked games, apps, photos and video to the computerlike smartphones.Now the 5G, or fifth generation, wireless revolution is near, promising data speeds 50 to 100 times faster than 4G LTE networks. Sure it'll improve smartphones, but that's not the point. Analysts say 5G's biggest impact will be to drive the proliferation of the Internet of Things — billions of connected devices.The business case for 5G is all about IoT, an evolution, or maybe revolution, that will take the internet era into new territories. Companies including chipmakers, network equipment makers and telecom service providers are investing heavily in the technology, with the first products to roll out in 2017.""With 5G, there are going to be many more device categories,"" Matt Grob, Qualcomm chief technology officer, told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: 5G holds big promise for the future, but how are key players performing now? One company worth watching is Arista Networks, a 2014 IPO that is battling Cisco Systems, the longtime networking gear leader. Arista is on the IBD 50 ranking of the top-performing stocks,  a good place to look for stocks possibly worth buying.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture. Farmers will, for example, know exactly when to harvest for best yields based on air temperature and soil moisture.Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) to name a few — expect new revenue streams from the IoT and game-changing apps outside of smartphones.Qualcomm aims to ship its first 5G modem chips for phones in the second half of 2017, with follow-on chips targeting the IoT.Qualcomm, like others, expects 5G to evolve on multiple tracks: IoT, smartphones and fixed residential. While Apple, Samsung and others will ship 5G smartphones only after standards are rubber-stamped, which observers say will be a work in progress until 2020 or later, carriers are closer with ""fixed"" 5G, a wireless broadband service provided from a fixed point to homes in limited areas. If  fixed 5G to homes works well in trials, Verizon says it will pursue a commercial rollout city-by-city in 2018 and 2019. It hasn't identified the cities yet.With 4G networks, it costs wireless firms about $1 to deliver a gigabyte of data. 5G networks promise much better economics. It also will provide virtually uninterrupted communications for new apps.""5G is going to bring lower costs per bit, lower latency and highly reliable services,"" Grob said. ""So it's going to be great for autonomous vehicles, medical devices and for infrastructure and smart cities. There are more companies taking part in the standards development for 5G than ever.""Medical applications include remote monitoring of devices like EKGs or blood pressure monitors. Smart city technologies include traffic signals that adjust to vehicle flows and sensor-based water systems that test for contaminants in real time.The Internet of Things isn't waiting on 5G. AT&T (T) already has some 8 million web-connected cars linked to its 4G network. U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) says it had 41 million IoT connections as of Sept. 30. Cisco says its gear links 4.9 billion devices now and will connect 12.2 billion by 2020, and few will be 5G.But the more speed, the better.Some companies might get a good boost early in the 5G revolution, such as makers of network testing gear like Keysight Technology (KEYS). Independent testing is a big part of the standards-setting process.Early on, analysts say Xilinx (XLNX) programmable chips will be useful for prototyping 5G products, while the higher radio frequency bands associated with 5G may create long-term opportunities for RF chip leaders Broadcom (AVGO) , Qorvo (QRVO) and Murata.As small cells are deployed in urban areas, cell tower firm Crown Castle (CCI) and startup Tarana Wireless aim to capture share. Tarana's biggest investor is AT&T. Some analysts view Zayo Holdings (ZAYO) as a takeover candidate, because small cell systems require fiber-optic links in metro areas for long-haul transport.Next-generation data centers — to keep all these things humming on the internet — will be another battleground, as Cisco takes on Arista Networks (ANET), startup Affirmed Networks and others.Meanwhile, startup SigFox, the LoRa alliance — with members including Cisco and IBM (IBM) — and others aim to provide all IoT devices with low-power connections via Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum.5G backers aim to create flexible networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices.While 4G networks provide cars with infotainment, 5G services are expected to provide real-time environmental data so, for example, driverless cars can avoid collisions.To service various types of devices, wireless networks will need to utilize both very high radio frequencies not yet commercialized and lower-band airwaves. Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.In urban areas, hundreds of ""small cell"" antennas hung on utility poles or buildings will work together, analysts say.Wireless networks and telecom data centers will be upgraded to provide both high and low data rate services, again to service various types of sensors and devices. AT&T and Verizon are among the leaders in moving to software-defined-network technology. SDN will help usher in 5G. With it, wireless firms can improve network bandwidth allocation and provide cloud-based, on-demand services.Part of the 5G revolution involves connecting a network of data centers to the IoT. That's a focus for Intel, Cisco, China's Huawei and many other companies.""5G will be a whole transformation of the network to virtualization, providing more flexibility and agility,"" said Jean Luc Valente, vice president of product management for Cisco's cloud and virtualization group. ""With 5G, with connected cars, some data is going to be collected, maybe at a traffic light intersection. Those data nuggets will be (analyzed), maybe not in the back-end data center, maybe much closer in a micro-cloud."" The upshot, among many benefits, is that self-driving cars won't collide.Cisco aims to provide cloud-based IoT services as it shifts away from hardware sales. The company partnered in February with Intel and Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC) to start selling a swath of 5G hardware and services. They are involved in 5G trials by Verizon and others.As 5G sparks partnerships, it's also generating M&As with 5G or IoT angles.Qualcomm expects its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to pay dividends in autonomous cars. Japan-based SoftBank acquired wireless chip designer ARM Holdings for $31 billion with an eye toward I0T.AT&T says it will move to 5G faster if regulators approve its acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), part of its strategy to whisk more video to mobile devices.Cisco bought Jasper in March for $1.4 billion, gaining a cloud-based IoT platform. Verizon in February announced an agreement to acquire XO Communications, which owns high-frequency spectrum for 5G services, for $1.8 billion.Internet leaders, too, are jockeying for leading roles in 5G. Facebook (FB) is working with equipment vendors and carriers on standards. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is developing open software for the IoT.For Intel, 5G and IoT offer an opportunity to turn its money-losing mobile business around, says Citigroup. For Qualcomm, the shift to 5G should provide higher profit margins as the 4G generation matures.South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in prestandard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. KT plans to showcase 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics, though just how isn't known.Aside from the Internet of Things and 5G mobility, Verizon is eyeing fixed 5G wireless broadband services to homes, potentially taking on cable TV companies. It's not clear yet if 5G fixed broadband could provide high-speed internet in neighborhoods or blanket bigger areas, analysts say. The Verizon trials will help determine that.Verizon has been investing across the board — in SDN, small cell technology and fixed wireless, says Adam Koeppe, vice president of technology planning at Verizon.""We're putting in the building blocks for what comes next. IoT is one of them,"" he said. ""The goal of the IoT device evolution is to have very low-cost modules, with long battery life. Think of sensors, smart meters — things that get embedded in day-to-day infrastructure and products that communicate on low bandwidth, on a sliver of spectrum, gobbling up very little of network resources.""""Where 5G fits into the equation is scale,"" Koeppe added. ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies — traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself — that's where 5G comes into play.""Yet 5G-related revenue is still on the distant horizon for most companies, analysts say. The marketing hype has picked up long before 5G networks and services will be deployed.IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now and will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason. Revenue is small in part because monthly revenue from IoT devices might come to just $1 or $2, not the $60 or more from smartphone users.RELATED:Qualcomm Upgraded On NXP Acquisition, Adds 'Tons Of Scale'Verizon Among Those With Lots At Stake With Next FCC ChairmanCisco Rival Arista Soars On Import Green Light

68,RF,"Chipmaker Cree is focusing more intently on its LED (light-emitting diode) strategy, announcing the $850 million sale of its power and RF (radio-frequency) division to Infineon Technologies -- news that sent Cree stock flying.On the stock market today, Cree lifted 10.6% to 27.74, hitting a 14-week high. Cree is now up for the year after being down 6% as of Wednesday vs. a 2% rise for IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group.The group ranks just No. 96 out of 197 groups tracked, but it's climbed from No. 169 in the past eight weeks. Leaders in the group include Apple (AAPL) suppliers Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC) which have Composite Ratings of 86 and 81, meaning they perform in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales and earnings growth, among other key metrics.IBD'S TAKE: Cree has a very low CR of 18, meaning it performs in the bottom 20% of all stocks in key metrics. But group leader Intel has made strong moves in recent days on speculation that it might take a chunk of Apple's iPhone 7 business.For Cree, moving further into LED-lighting taps into its 2015 strategy. At that time, Cree had planned to launch an initial public offering for Wolfspeed, its power and RF division. But now, Infineon plans to buy it by year's end in an all-cash offer.""Selling Wolfspeed to Infineon speeds our transition to a more-focused LED lighting company while providing significant resources to accelerate our growth,"" CEO Chuck Swoboda said in a statement.Divesting Wolfspeed will generate $585 million in net proceeds after taxes and other costs, Cree said.Under the terms of the deal, Infineon will acquire Cree's silicon carbide substrate business for power and its RF and gemstone applications. Both Cree's board of directors and Infineon's supervisory board have approved the transaction.The unit brought in $173 million in pro forma revenue for the 12 months ended March 27, Cree said. But it was Cree's smallest unit, accounting for only 7% of total sales vs. its bread-and-butter lighting unit (57%) and its LED unit (36%).Cree also preannounced its June-ended fiscal Q4 results, with $388 million in sales topping the consensus of 16 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $382.85. That would be up by single digits on a year-over-year basis vs. earlier expectations for flat sales and vs. declines in fiscal Q1 and Q3.LED lit the way for Cree's fiscal Q4 with $160 million in sales beating expectations. Lighting pulled in $197 million and was in line with projections. Wolfspeed met views at $31 million. Cree is slated to release its full fiscal Q4 results after the close Aug. 16.

71,RF,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 news is seen as positive for Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Intel (INTC), but negative for Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Wall Street analysts.The iPhone 7 supports 25 radio-frequency bands vs. 23 bands in the iPhone 6S series.""Overall the increased RF content should remain a tailwind for RF suppliers as other handset (manufacturers) emulate the iPhone road map,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report. The increased bands in the iPhone 7 will be especially positive for Broadcom, he said.The increased bands should benefit all RF suppliers, but Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO) will benefit more than Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said.IBD'S TAKE: Among Apple chip suppliers seen benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch, only Broadcom is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic will profit from Apple's decision to remove the analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 and include digital earbuds and an adapter with the new handset, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report.Cirrus Logic also will benefit from Apple adding a second speaker to the iPhone 7 to give it stereo sound, he said.""We anticipate an incremental $2.50 in content associated with the Lightning earpods, Lightning adapter and second stereo speaker,"" Vinh said. ""Despite the significant content increase, we believe much of this has already been built into guidance and stock expectations.""For that reason, he is sector weight, or neutral, on Cirrus Logic stock.It is unclear whether Cirrus Logic has content in Apple's new wireless earbuds called AirPods, Vinh noted. AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159 a pair.His ""favorite Apple-exposed suppliers"" are Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Skyworks.Suppliers getting content boosts from the iPhone 7 likely include ADI and Broadcom, RBC Capital Markets said in a report.ADI could get about 30% more content in the iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S series after winning a processor for the camera module, RBC said. Analog Devices gets about 13% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom also could see a 30% boost in content in the iPhone 7, RBC said. Broadcom gets about 15% to 18% of its revenue from Apple.The iPhone 7 is a negative for Qualcomm, because it could lose 20% to 25% of its baseband chip share in the new smartphone to Intel, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Qualcomm is supplying CDMA versions of the iPhone 7 and Intel is supplying non-CDMA versions, which is based on the wireless technologies carriers use.Apple's iPhone 7 is seen as positive for memory suppliers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) because the new handsets feature twice as much Nand flash data storage as last year's models.The iPhone 7 series has data storage from 32 gigabytes to 256 GB vs. the prior 16 GB to 128 GB.""Doubling Nand storage could further tighten Nand supply and set a trend toward 256-GB handset densities,"" Mizuho's Rakesh said. ""The increased Nand storage should drive further pricing and margin stability in an already tight Nand supply chain, which is a clear positive for MU and WDC.""Apple shares finished 2.6% lower on stock market today at 105.52, as its announcement carried few surprises. Broadcom dipped 0.3%, Qualcomm rose 0.4%, Intel was essentially flat, Cirrus Logic eased 0.15%, while Micron gained 1.7%.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Launch Not 'Insanely Great,' But 'Good Enough'

72,RF,"The major indexes lost some more gains Friday afternoon after an August payrolls report showed decent gains on the jobs front, but not enough to spur a fast move to raise the cost of money.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, backing a bit from its early gain of almost 0.7%. So far this week, the Nasdaq is up about 0.5%. The NYSE Composite gapped up at the open and advanced 0.7% on the back of solid gains by oil, mining, security software, gaming software, long-term Medicare facility and hospital stocks.Oil and silver futures shot higher. Government bonds sold off as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to 1.61%, up 4 basis points.Analysts gave a nearly unanimous response that the 151,000 increase in August payrolls was not enough to spur the Federal Reserve to go ahead with its first new increase in short-term interest rates when the U.S. central bank meets later this month. In December, the Fed raised the fed funds rate for overnight loans to a 0.25%-0.5% range.""This number definitely doesn't force a rate increase in September and is at the lower end of expectations -- a weak overall report,"" Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at Florida-based EverBank, said. ""If the data continues to match the recent pattern of disappointment we could see the chances of ANY rate increase in 2016 fade away.""The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%. On the Dow, big price movers included Chevron (CVX) (up 1%, still lagging below its 50-day moving average), Boeing (BA) (up 1%, testing resistance at the 200-day line), and Home Depot (HD) (up 0.7%, just shy of a 137.92 base-on-base entry).Volume on both exchanges was running mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time on Thursday. The stock market will be closed Monday for Labor Day.Apple (AAPL) helped all the major indexes with its heft and market cap of $577 billion. The iPhone maker, set to announce new products next week, gapped up at the open and rose as much as 1.2% to 108. It is now up 0.3% to 107.04, yet the stock continues to slowly position itself for a potential breakout, at 110.33. That's 10 cents above the top of downward-sloping handle in a consolidation.Indeed, Apple is no longer a big growth stock. The savvy CAN SLIM investor will keep both eyes open for brand-new names that have the kind of awesome growth in profits, sales, and outstanding return on equity and profit margins that Apple once had. Stocks that went public within the past three to eight years are often great candidates.One may be Impinj (PI), a brand-new name on the Nasdaq. The semiconductor play surged 13%, to 31.17 in heavy trading Friday, adding to Thursday's 21% rally.After peaking at 24.93 on Aug. 18, Impinj cooled off for 10 trading sessions -- enough time to form a narrow IPO base. The stock burst past the 25.03 pivot point on Thursday in the heaviest trade since its July 21 debut at 14 a share. It's now sharply extended from proper buy range.Impinj produces RF (radio frequency) ID tags that get placed in medicine bottles and other consumer products that allow manufacturers to make better supply-chain decisions. Late Wednesday, the Seattle-based firm reported earnings of 5 cents a share, smashing Wall Street's consensus view yet down 44%, but that may have been due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Third-quarter earnings are expected to jump 500% to 6 cents a share. Revenue rose 37% to $25.9 million.The stock has just 19 million shares outstanding and a float of 9 million, so keep in mind that it tends to swing more wildly than the average stock. Plus, it hasn't yet reported quarterly earnings of more than 10 cents a share, so year-over-year gains may be in part exaggerated by the small figures.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Amplify Snack Brands (BETR), another young gun and fast-growing food firm, rallied 1% to 16.98, moving a bit further past a new 16.76 V-shaped cup base entry. The Austin, Texas-based company went public on Aug. 5 at 18 a share, so watch for potential upside resistance at the price level.Lululemon (LULU) plunged 8.5% to nearly round-trip its gains after breaking out past a 68.03 flat-base buy point in July. The yogawear firm posted fiscal Q2 earnings of 38 cents a share, up 12% and the best bottom-line growth in 11 quarters, but it only matched Wall Street's consensus view. Revenue jumped 14%, the 10th quarter in a row of modest double-digit increases, but slightly below views. Lululemon's guidance was cautious.But some names in the apparel and clothing retail field still joined Friday's rally. They included Anthropologie chain operator Urban Outfitters (URBN) (up 0.6%, holding a recent powerful upward price gap) and Nordstrom (JWN) (up nearly 2%, trying to hold its rebound back above the key 200-day line).IBD's TAKE: Impinj is part of a top-performing sector.

73,RF,"Xilinx (XLNX), Cavium (CAVM) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) fit the bill for Broadcom's (AVGO) anticipated future M&A plans, but a ""merger of equals"" with fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is also possible, MKM analyst Ian Ing said Monday.Any such merger would follow Broadcom's early February combination with the former Avago Technologies for $37 billion. In June, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom will soon begin pulling excess cash for M&A.Meanwhile, Broadcom stock is range-bound as it mulls its M&A opportunities, Ing wrote in a research report. Ing kept his buy rating and 188 price target on Broadcom stock Monday ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings report, due out late Thursday.""Investors now focus on how quickly they can do another accretive acquisition,"" he said. ""Our concerns center around the lack of remaining attractive deals available, given the framework of asset-light and OEM customer focus.""Broadcom could go after Qualcomm, he said, though Qualcomm's $92 billion market cap dwarfs Broadcom's $70.5 billion cap, and ""powerful smartphone customers may not embrace a single supplier across both 'digital baseband' and RF (radio frequency) content.""The duo supply chips for Apple iPhones. Apple's newest flagship handset, the iPhone 7, is expected to be unveiled Sept. 7.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is expected to survive Apple's rumored 15%-20% component order cut for iPhone 7 supplies, according to Pacific Crest analysts.Ing cut his fiscal Q3 wireless view to 26% sequential growth, implying $997.9 million, or 26% of his total $3.79 billion revenue forecast. For the October quarter, he sees $1.25 billion in wireless sales, about 30% of total sales, as the iPhone 7 ramps.He expects wired sales to benefit from new product cycles in Tomahawk switching and Jericho routing.Analysts model $3.76 billion and $4.05 billion in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4 sales, respectively, for Broadcom. On a year-over-year basis, Broadcom's sales would grow 115% and 119%, respectively.On the stock market today, Broadcom stock rose 0.1% to 177.40.

74,RF,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is better-positioned to grow than low-band radio-frequency (RF) rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as infrastructure upgrades spur data usage and demand for increasingly advanced chips, Citigroup analyst Atif Malik said Thursday.Malik upgraded Qorvo stock to neutral from a sell rating on the likelihood of continued content gains in Apple's iPhone 7 following increased dollar content in Samsung's Galaxy S7 and Apple's iPhone SE. And Qorvo's high-end BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filters will be key to breaking into the carrier aggregation market.But Skyworks was downgraded, as it lacks premium filters necessary to hit the carrier aggregation market, and has seen increased competition amid dual sourcing in the low-band market.""We could become constructive on the stock is Skyworks can accelerate its diversification strategy,"" Malik wrote in a research report. ""Mobile (is) still 80% of the overall sales.""Malik cut his fiscal 2017 earnings per share view on Skyworks to 3% below broad expectations which would be $6. The consensus model of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for $6.18. His fiscal 2017 Qorvo model is roughly in line with Wall Street for $4.90.Skyworks stock dipped 0.6% on the stock market today, trailing shares of top rivals Qorvo and Broadcom (AVGO), up less than 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Apple added 0.7%.On average, RF chipmaker stocks are up 20% since early May on Apple's iPhone 7 ramp-up and better-than-expected Q2 mobile demand in China, Malik wrote. He expects continued iPhone 6S inventory burn ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, expected in September.But Skyworks stock is underperforming Malik's estimate as well as IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group and key competitors Broadcom and Qorvo. Since early May, Skyworks stock is up 2% vs. 24.5% and 12% increases in Qorvo and Broadcom stocks. Broadly, fabless chipmakers are up 12%.

75,RF,"The stock market padded Tuesday's strong gains with a healthy advance by midday Wednesday. Large caps moved ahead of small caps.Meanwhile, Atlanta-based regional banking leader SunTrust Banks (STI) continued to act well after breaking out of a nearly six-month cup-with-handle pattern with a 43.13 buy point. The stock gained 2% to 44.01, up 2% past the proper entry.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 0.9% each after advancing 2% and 1.4%, respectively, on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was also up 0.9%. Utilities continued to sink after having a white-hot first quarter. The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.7%. The small-cap S&P 600 added 0.6%. Volume was tracking lower on the Nasdaq from the previous session, but it was higher on the NYSE.The super regional bank and money center bank industry subgroups held a spot among the top 15 advancers among IBD's 197 industry groups in the stock market today, each rising more than 2% so far. The growing prospect of another rate hike at either the June or July Federal Reserve meetings has apparently attracted more institutional buying in lenders. Higher short-term interest rates will enable banks to charge more for loans, improving profit margins.SunTrust suffered mightily in the wake of the subprime debt crash, as the bank suffered net losses in both 2009 and 2010, but earnings have since gotten back on track. Wall Street sees EPS rising in the low- to mid-single digits both this year and next. Pretax margin has risen sharply over the past five years, from 0.2% in 2010 to 31.5% last year. It has total assets of $194 billion as of March this year. Non-performing loans represented just 0.7% of total loans outstanding. A quarter-to-quarter increase of $303 million in such loans was due mainly to Wall Street downgrades of energy-related debt.SunTrust gets an 82 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Just two other companies in its Banks-Super Regional subgroup get a higher EPS Rating: Great Western Bancorp (GWB) (92) and Regions Financial (RF) of Birmingham, Ala. (86).The 5% buy zone in SunTrust extends up to 45.29.Which commercial and real estate-focused bank joined IBD Leaderboard as a premium growth play that just also broke out? See it here.Elsewhere in the market Wednesday, various oil-related stocks advanced, as West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures headed toward the $50-a-barrel level.Drilling, field services and oil machinery subgroups paced the upside with gains of 2.7% to 3.3%. The field services is ranked highest among the three at 100th among 197 IBD groups and subgroups, as seen in IBD's daily rankings. In the group, 800-pound industry gorilla Halliburton (HAL) (EPS 8, Relative Strength Rating 84) gained more than 2.5% in light trade to 42.53 and was looking to clear a 42.92 handle buy point in a very deep, cup-style bottoming base.Oil States (OIS), Superior Energy Services (SPN), Archrock Partners (APLP), RPC Inc.

76,RF,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan hinted Thursday at Apple's (AAPL) ""imminent"" recovery, thanks to its iPhone 7 ramp, MKM analyst Ing Ing said Friday after Tan guided to 20% sequential wireless growth in the July quarter and increased content in the 7 vs. the iPhone 6S.Sales of Apple's iPhone 6S have largely disappointed. In April, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. The July quarter will be ""a very different picture,"" Tan told analysts Thursday during the company's Q2 earnings conference call.A ""large North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- is ramping up its next flagship smartphone with a ""substantial"" increase in Broadcom content, Tan said on the call. That will likely increase again in October, he said.IBD Take: Broadcom ranks No. 7 in its big group. Find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.""A strong Apple smartphone cycle appears imminent,"" Ing wrote in a research report Friday as he boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 188 from 162. Ing reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock.Ing was one of at least 16 analysts Friday to boost their price targets on Broadcom stock following the company's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Thursday. Broadcom stock gapped up to a record high of 166 early on the stock market today, and shares were up nearly 5%, to 162.56 at the close.Radio-frequency competitors Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks also lifted early Friday, though Qorvo was down a fraction in morning trading. Broadcom's fiscal Q3 guidance topped the consensus, and it posted a hefty 15-cent Q2 earnings beat on better-than-expected post-Avago merger synergies.Late Thursday, Broadcom reported $792 million in wireless sales, up 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing guidance for $820 million. Wired infrastructure sales soared 440% to $2.06 billion. Enterprise storage and industrial sales came in at $525 million and $182 million, up 12% and down 17%, respectively. Broadcom's Tomahawk switches drove blowout wired revenue, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss said Friday.Stoss maintained his buy rating and 200 price target on Broadcom stock, and he sees Broadcom growing its iPhone 7 content by 30% vs. the iPhone 6S, potentially offsetting the possibility of another dip in iPhone unit shipments.Investors are missing the runway on RF chipmakers, Stoss wrote in a research report.""We expect at least several more years of additional content gains due to more bands, carrier aggregation and additional RF filters,"" he wrote. ""We believe the expected launch of 5G in 2020 will only add to the content gains and RF flexibility.""He also expects Broadcom's appetite for M&A might be growing. Broadcom paid off $565 million of debt in Q2 and expects to pay $1 billion in Q3 with cash from divestitures, such as the sale of its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY).Analysts have posited Broadcom could make a play for small chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX). Fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) has also been thrown into the hypothetical Xilinx bidder mix. In 2015, chip sector M&A topped $115 billion.""We believe Broadcom will be in a position to make an additional acquisition or two by the end of this calendar year,"" Stoss wrote. ""Broadcom has demonstrated the ability to extract substantial value and reap the benefits of scale through accretive acquisitions.""
"
77,RF,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock rocketed late Thursday after its first post-merger earnings report, topping Wall Street's earnings view by 15 cents and edging revenue views despite Apple's (AAPL) first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.In after-hours trading, Broadcom stock was up more than 6% following its fiscal Q2 earnings release. Shares rose a fraction in Thursday's regular session, to 154.91, and are up 6% for the year.For its Q2 ended May 1, Broadcom reported $3.56 billion in sales minus items and $2.53 earnings per share ex items, up 117% and 19%, respectively, vs. last year, and leading the consensus estimate of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.55 billion and $2.38.Current-quarter guidance for $3.75 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $75 million, would be up 114% on a year-over-year basis, topping analysts' model for $3.71 billion. The non-GAAP guidance includes $10 million in licensing revenue.The quarter was Broadcom's first reporting combined Broadcom and Avago metrics, while the year-earlier figures were for Avago only. The former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, a deal that closed on Feb. 1, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago's ticker. Now, analysts say Broadcom could deleverage and seek more M&A.Broadcom competes against fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) to provide radio-frequency chips for smartphones, including the iPhone.A UBS analyst was bullish earlier Thursday on RF names vs. analog names like Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), both also Apple suppliers who've seen investors pull back because of the companies' consumer exposure.
"
78,RF,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pledge to make 1 million electric cars by 2020 could be a boon for chipmakers clobbered by the first decline in sales of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, a major hit product that fueled growth for many Apple suppliers since 2007.Now, hunger for the next growth vector has many chipmakers eyeing the automotive and Internet of Things markets, even as smartphones will remain a key profit center for some semiconductor companies.""I view the IoT market as a massive opportunity, and the autonomous vehicle is a part of that,"" Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. ""Over time, this market will experience widespread adoption. Simply, the promise of greater productivity will drive demand over the long run.""The deck is always reshuffled every few years and always to the most innovative technology. We think the IoT is the next battleground.""Kreher expects the IoT industry overall, including automotive, to grow 10% to 15% annually in the next three years.Sensor makers like Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN); analog chipmakers like MaxLinear (MXL) and Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM); and graphics-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are among those seen as especially primed in these fields.But not everyone is as hot on the Internet of Things. Robert Maire, president of tech research and consulting firm Semiconductor Advisers, calls today's cars ""PCs on wheels"" and ""smartphones on steroids,"" but he says other IoT fields typically use cheaper chips than the higher-end chips powering smartphones.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) CEO David Aldrich said in April that the IoT opportunity is ""measured in the tens of billions of units,"" but Maire says that doesn't mean huge revenue growth.""It won't be the Internet of Things (replacing smartphones), because Internet of Things is based on typically trailing-edge semiconductor technology,"" Maire told IBD. ""About $5 worth of semiconductors go into an Internet-connected thermostat that sells for $75-$100.""The Qualcomm (QCOM) chip content alone in Apple's iPhone 6 has been estimated at $20 to $22 per unit by teardown specialist iFixit.But companies such as Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are looking beyond the smartphone era to a future dominated by smarter cities, smarter devices and smarter cars -- and are eagerly watching efforts by tech heavyweights Tesla, Apple and Google (GOOGL) to make it happen.Still, estimating the size of the IoT chip market is like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. The numbers are high but cover a lot of ground.Last year, research firm McKinsey pegged revenue for the total IoT market at $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the highest end, that means IoT could account for more than 10% of the total world economy.In April, Business Insider estimated there will be 24 billion IoT-connected devices by 2020. More than $6 trillion will be invested in IoT solutions over the next five years, the online news site's Business Intelligence research unit estimates.Many of Apple's chip suppliers want a bite of IoT, but not all. Broadcom (AVGO) in April sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) for $550 million. The unit generated just $189 million in revenue in the past 12 months, 3% of Broadcom's total sales.Broadcom declined to comment on the IoT unit's sale or on slowing smartphone sales. In its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Broadcom reported that its wireless business (which includes smartphone sales) pulled in $578 million in sales, about a third of total revenue. MKM analyst Ian Ing estimates 10% of Broadcom's mobile sales stem from smartphone-saturated China.Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks, Broadcom's rival makers of the radio-frequency chips that go inside smartphones, are buying into the IoT market -- Qorvo doing so literally with its April acquisition of IoT supplier GreenPeak. GreenPeak makes ultra-low-power, short-range wireless chips for smart homes.The acquisition should help Qorvo diversify. Qorvo didn't return requests for comment about slowing smartphone sales. For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo's mobile product sales accounted for $465 million, or about 76%, of total revenue.As for Skyworks, its integrated mobile systems and power amplifiers segments accounted for 73% of its total sales last quarter. Apple's iPhone 6S uses two Skyworks power amplifier modules, teardowns show.But Skyworks' broad markets division, which includes IoT-related sales, grew 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and made up 25% of sales, Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call in April. He estimated the IoT opportunity growing at an 83% compound annual growth rate through 2020.Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy supplier Integrated Device Technology acknowledges the smartphone slowdown but says its future is in wireless charging. IDT's chips are used inside portable devices to enable wireless charging, which will become ever more important as Apple reportedly prepares to eliminate wired charging entirely from the iPhone 8 in 2017.IDT is about 17% exposed to the mobile market, CTO Sailesh Chittipeddi told IBD.Smartphones have reached a saturation point. But not every piece of accompanying technology has peaked, Chittipeddi said. RF suppliers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks also say that while unit shipments might stagnate, dollar content will grow. In January, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said RF content has grown 20%-plus every year regardless the number of units shipped.Qualcomm -- doubly exposed through its chip sales and licensing business -- is also bullish on continued growth of its smartphone business. The breadth of technology on a smartphone will only continue to grow, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during the company's February analyst day.""The smartphone ecosystem is going to continue to grow, as wireless charging penetration of that market continues to increase,"" Chittipeddi told IBD. ""People still sell over 1.2 billion smartphones per year and not every one of them today has wireless charging.""And there are other demands for wireless charging. In March, IDT hosted a Hackster challenge, instructing participants to come up with new uses for wireless charging. Er Bharath Ram came up with an on-the-go coffee maker, beating out oddities like a tiny remote-controlled tank, a ""magic toothbrush"" and shoes for Alzheimer's sufferers.""Furniture, automotive applications, headsets, warmers, drones ... will provide growth,"" Chittipeddi said, though he concedes not as much growth as a new, high-volume smartphone.Last year, IDT expanded into sensors with the $310 million acquisition of ZMDI, Chittipeddi said. IDT plans to leverage that sensor business within the burgeoning automotive and infotainment market competing against NXP Semiconductors.About the same time IDT wrapped its ZMDI acquisition, NXP finished up its nearly $13 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductors. NXP now boasts a $28.5 billion market cap to IDT's $2.7 billion. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of his company's sales stem from the automotive segment.Clemmer says NXP spotted the smartphone's deceleration well ahead of time. Although, like Chittipeddi, he still sees growth for specialized smartphone tech. NXP chips are used to encrypt mobile payments for systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet or Google Wallet.""Maybe 15% to 20% of smartphones have mobile wallets (and) we think that can go up to 60%,"" he said. ""We see a tripling of our volume because of the increased share that has the mobile wallet technology.""Buying Freescale helped de-emphasize mobile. In Q1, NXP's $471 million in secure connected devices (mobile) accounted for 21% of sales. But Clemmer says that exposure, on average, is about 15%. It also allowed the combined company to become the top automotive chip player, he says.NXP is also working with Tesla, Google, Apple and  Ford (F) as they work to develop self-driving cars, Clemmer says, another key push for NXP.That automotive opportunity will be huge, says Nvidia's director of automotive, Danny Shapiro. In April, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled a trio of autonomous cars code-named BB8, C3PO and R2D2 -- a riff on the popular ""Star Wars"" franchise.Like NXP, Nvidia has developed an autonomous-driving platform for carmakers. Unlike NXP, Nvidia only briefly dabbled in smartphones for which graphics only need to be ""good enough,"" Shapiro told IBD. Nvidia, he says, is angling for the bleeding edge of tech.So, no smartphone chips from Nvidia. ""There's no value there for us,"" Shapiro said. But ""I believe the car will be the most powerful computer you will ever own. ... We've moved beyond the graphics in your vehicles to being able to process the data. And for that, you need a supercomputer.""

79,RF,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) likely gained another 20% in iPhone 7 content on top of continued increases in Samsung Galaxy smartphones, giving investors ""multiple ways to win,"" Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Thursday.Broadcom is slated to report Q2 earnings on June 2 after the market close. Pitzer expects in-line Q2 sales, but he sees a ""significant EPS cushion"" on cost-cutting and synergies related to Broadcom's merger with the former Avago. In February, Avago completed its $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom, with the merged company taking the Broadcom name, in a deal the companies said gives the combined entity an enterprise value of $77 billion.For Q2, the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Broadcom to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share minus items, up 116% and 12%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.On Wednesday, fellow Apple supplier Analog Devices (ADI) reported year-over-year sales declines for fiscal Q2 and guided to another 5% sales dip for its July quarter. Pitzer expects Broadcom's July-quarter sales view to likewise disappoint.But, like Analog Devices, Broadcom expects to grow its iPhone 7 content. Three months ago, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom's radio-frequency (RF) content in smartphones has increased by 20% every year, and that this year will be no exception.Tan's view came before Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales, occurring in the March quarter.Pitzer sees Broadcom guiding to $3.39 billion in fiscal Q3 sales, below the consensus view for $3.72 billion. But he boosted his EPS-minus-items view to $2.64 from $2.51, matching the consensus model. For 2016 and 2017, he expects $11.16 and $12.86 EPS ex items, respectively.Wireless sales -- including sales to Apple -- have declined to 25% of total revenue from 50%. Less volatile data center sales now account for half of Broadcom's revenue, he wrote.""Broadcom's portfolio of businesses is significantly dampening the impact of any single headwind,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Broadcom can weather 'isolated storms' while maintaining the integrity of EPS upside.""Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and a 180 price target on Broadcom stock. Broadcom shares fell a fraction, to 142.74, on the stock market today. RF rivals Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) fell 1.2% and a fraction, respectively.The trio fell amid fresh reports examining the effect slowing smartphone sales will have on chipmakers.
"
80,RF,"Qorvo (QRVO) sidestepped Apple's (AAPL) iPhone drag late Wednesday with a Wall Street-crushing fiscal Q4 earnings report, and with guidance that -- unlike rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) -- topped consensus expectations.In after-hours trading, Qorvo stock rocketed 7% after closing down 1.2% in Wednesday's regular session, and leading shares of radio-frequency rivals Skyworks and Broadcom (AVGO), whose stocks both rose a fraction.For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo reported $608.1 million in sales and $1.04 earnings per share minus items, down a respective 4% and 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, but topping analysts' model for $599.2 million and 92 cents.Three months ago, Qorvo guided to $600 million and 90-95 cents.Qorvo ended fiscal 2016 with $2.61 billion in sales, up 53%, and $4.38 EPS ex items, down 8%. Sales edged the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.6 billion, but EPS topped by 12 cents.Current-quarter guidance for $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS minus items would be down 6% and 12% year over year, but that's ahead of analyst expectations for $628.6 million and 96 cents.Last week, Skyworks reported fiscal Q2 metrics that topped views, but shares crashed 6.9% on Q3 sales guidance that missed by about $50 million. Analysts called for a similar report from Qorvo, which is more heavily exposed to Apple's iPhone product cycle. Apple iPhone sales have slowed -- for the first time -- ahead of the iPhone 7 release expected in September.But all three RF suppliers will ramp up on the iPhone 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari says.
"
81,RF,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone drag will seize another victim Wednesday, a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested Tuesday, ahead of Qorvo's (QRVO) quarterly earnings report, with Wall Street forecasting the chipmaker's first year-over-year sales decline in eight quarters.But the Apple trough will likely resolve in the second half of the year, when the iPhone 7 ramps, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a research report. He expects radio-frequency chip rivals Qorvo, Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) to see growth from the release of the iPhone 7, expected in September.""While unit headwinds and inventory burn at Apple could weigh on results, we believe we are at the trough of the cycle and expect RF fundamental to improve,"" Hari wrote. ""The RF content growth story is still fully intact.""First, though, heavily-Apple-exposed Qorvo has to survive the March quarter, for which Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in smartphone sales.For Qorvo's fiscal Q4, the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $599.2 million in sales and 92 cents earnings per share minus items, down a respective 6% and 17% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Qorvo reports after the close Wednesday.Three months ago, Qorvo guided to $600 million in sales and 90-95 cents EPS ex items. Qorvo's sales and EPS have decelerated for the past three and four quarters, respectively. Last quarter, EPS fell for the first time since September 2012.For the fiscal year, Qorvo is expected to report 52% sales growth, to $2.6 billion. But analyst consensus calls for a 10% decline in EPS ex items, to $4.26.In the stock market today, Qorvo stock rose a fraction to 45.04, while Broadcom fell 2% and Skyworks fell a fraction.Last week, Skyworks' fiscal Q2 metrics topped analysts' consensus, but Q3 guidance missed. Then, Skyworks stock dropped 6.9%. Hari says Qorvo stock could experience a similar dip. But Qorvo shares are already down 12% over the past 12 months, and ""weakness may not be as pronounced,"" he wrote.Hari cut his price target on Qorvo stock to 44 from 47 but kept his neutral rating. He trimmed his Broadcom stock price target to 171 from 175, but he still rates it and Skyworks both a buy.Among the three, Qorvo is the most Apple-exposed, Hari wrote.""We expect investors to focus on its (fiscal Q1) guide (impact of Apple fallout) and execution (share gains at Samsung),"" he wrote.
"
82,RF,"Apple’s (AAPL) ""iPhone drag"" tugged Skyworks Solutions’ (SWKS) fiscal Q3 guidance by $50 million late Thursday, prompting shares of radio-frequency chip rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) to topple Friday.Skyworks stock led a broad Apple chip sphere fall, falling 6.9% to 66.82 on the stock market today. Shares of competitors Broadcom and Qorvo were down a respective 1.5% and 1.75%.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) stocks followed, down 0.7%, 3.1% and 5.65%, respectively.Apple itself lost 1.15%, trading near its lowest levels since mid-2014.For its fiscal Q2, which ended April 1, Skyworks reported $775.1 million in sales and $1.25 earnings per share minus items, in line and topping the consensus of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $775.6 million and $1.24.But EPS slipped to single-digit growth for the first time in 13 quarters, rising 9% year over year. Sales rose 2%, in the single-digit range for the first time in 14 quarters. Both metrics have decelerated for five consecutive quarters.Current-quarter guidance for $750 million in sales and $1.21 EPS ex items would be down 7% and 10%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales have never declined in the past five years. EPS has declined twice, but this quarter's decline would be the biggest.And both metrics lagged the consensus for $800.5 million and $1.32.Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh blamed the ""iPhone drag"" for Skyworks' weak guidance. On Tuesday, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years.Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday that the company planned to cut channel inventories in the June quarter ""in light of the macroeconomic environment."" Late Tuesday, supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) offered Q3 guidance that also missed Wall Street views.But Skyworks expects a strong September quarter, with 20% and 40% content gains at Samsung and Huawei. On average, Chinese smartphones are growing content by 20% year over year, Rakesh wrote in a research report.Rakesh cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 99 from 105 but reiterated a buy rating.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri estimates that 40 million to 50 million iPhones will be sold in the June quarter, leading to better upside in Skyworks' fiscal Q4. But he adds that Qorvo might be a stronger RF competitor now.Both analysts suggest that Skyworks look to diversify amid the slowing Chinese and iPhone markets. Arcuri reduced his price target on Skyworks stock to 76 from 78 and kept his market perform rating.
"
83,RF,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ought to acquire Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) to diversify from the slowing smartphone and radio-frequency market, Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell suggested Thursday.Maxim has long been takeover bait with sharks Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) reportedly eyeing the $10.5 billion-market-cap chipmaker in October. But sources told Bloomberg that Maxim might not sell without a high premium.Skyworks could provide that premium, McConnell wrote in a research report. Maxim stock rose a fraction Thursday, to 36.78. Skyworks was flat. An offer of $44 per share would be a 20% premium to Maxim stock, McConnell points out.Acquiring Maxim would help Skyworks diversify beyond its 80% exposure to the struggling mobile market, McConnell wrote. Maxim has ties to the data center and automotive markets.Though Maxim makes the most sense -- McConnell rates both a buy -- Skyworks could also diversify by acquiring Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) or Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), McConnell wrote.RF, Skyworks' bread and butter, is slated for a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the next several years vs. historical 18% growth, McConnell wrote. Skyworks competes in the RF ring with Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple suppliers.The number of bands -- a spectrum of RF -- rocketed between 2005 and 2015, Brent Dietz, Qorvo director of corporate communications, told IBD. In 2005, there were two bands. By 2015, there were 43.McConnell sees little opportunity for continued band acceleration. And Dietz offered a similar growth view for the RF market -- a $10 billion market opportunity with a 10%-15% growth rate.But Dietz notes that the RF content in smartphones has gapped up this century. Less complex 2G phones had about 80 cents worth of RF content. Today, most smartphones have about $16 worth of RF.To that point, Broadcom's mobile RF content grows in excess of 20% every year, CEO Hock Tan said during the company's Q1 earnings conference call. He expects 2016 to be no different.This year, Qorvo and Skyworks offered similar views of growing dollar content in marquee smartphones. Recent teardowns show that Samsung completely replaced three Skyworks chips in its Galaxy S7 and that Qorvo twice replaced Broadcom.
"
84,RF,"Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in Apple’s (AAPL) newly launched iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found Thursday.Apple's iPhone SE is ""the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,"" the smartphone giant says. It was unveiled March 21 and began shipping today, the same day Tesla Motors (TSLA) began taking orders for its less expensive Model 3.Researchers with Chipworks and iFixit classified the iPhone SE, the first to not have a number in its name, as the iPhone 6S squeezed into the iPhone 5S body.""There are very few new parts, but that hardly means there is no innovation,"" Chipworks wrote. But Apple engaged in ""serious economical re-use"" of many radio-frequency (RF) chips, excepting the Skyworks and Texas Instruments additions.New to the iPhone SE, Skyworks gained a power amplifier module and Texas Instruments earned a power management chip. Privately-held Toshiba and Epcos made new appearances with a flash-memory chip and an antenna switch module.A new power management chip could also be an Apple-Dialog Semiconductor mash-up, Chipworks wrote.Qualcomm and Qorvo each have four chips in the phone, leading Skyworks, which contributed three iPhone SE chips. Broadcom (AVGO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) each supplied two chips. Texas Instruments, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) all brought one apiece to the table.The A9 processor was supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), in this particular phone. But Apple dual-sourced the A9 in the iPhone 6S, splitting share between Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung.Samsung reportedly has since said that it would yield the A10 processor to Taiwan Semiconductor. The A10 processor is scheduled to make its debut in the iPhone 7, likely to be launched in September.
"
85,RF,"Federal regulators and Verizon Communications (VZ) have zeroed in on airwaves that could make the U.S. the global leader in rolling out 5G wireless services.One market opportunity for 5G may be as a challenger to the cable TV industry’s broadband dominance. Think Verizon Wireless, not Verizon's FiOS-branded landline service, vs. the likes of Comcast (CMCSA) or Charter Communications (CHTR).First, though, airwaves need to be freed up for 5G. That's where high-frequency radio spectrum, also called millimeter wave, comes in. In particular, U.S. regulators are focused on the 28 gigahertz frequency band, analysts say. Most wireless phone services today use radio frequency below 3 GHz.If 28 GHz or millimeter wave rings a bell, that’s because several fixed wireless startups (WinStar, Teligent, Nextlink, Terabeam) tried and failed in commercializing products relying on high-frequency airwaves during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Business models were suspect, and their LMDS (local multipoint distribution services) were susceptible to interference from rain and other environmental conditions.When the tech bubble burst in 2000-01, the LMDS startups perished. Technology advances, however, could make the high-frequency airwaves prime candidates for 5G.""In the 1990s, with LMDS, mobile data wasn't mature, and neither was the Internet, and neither was the electronics industry -- it couldn't make low cost, mmWave devices,"" said Ted Rappaport, founding director of NYU Wireless, New York University's research center on millimeter-wave technologies.""Wi-Fi was really brand new then, and broadband backhaul was not even built out. LMDS was originally conceived to be like fiber, to serve as backhaul (long-distance), or point-to-multipoint, and was not for mobile services. Fast forward to today, backhaul is in place to accommodate demand, and electronics at mmWave frequencies are being mass-produced in cars. Demand for data is increasing more than 50% a year, and the only way to continue to supply capacity to users is to move up to (millimeter wave).""The Federal Communications Commission in October opened a study looking at 28, 37, 39, and 60 GHz as the primary bands for 5G. While the FCC says 28 GHz airwaves show promise, some countries have been focused on higher frequencies rather than 28 GHz.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, speaking at a U.S. Senate committee hearing on March 2, said: “While international coordination is preferable, I believe we should move forward with exploration of the 28 GHz band.”Wheeler said that the U.S. will lead the world in 5G and allocate spectrum ""faster than any nation on the planet.""Verizon, meanwhile, on Feb. 22 agreed to buy privately held XO Communications’ fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion. In a side deal, Verizon will also lease XO’s wireless spectrum in the 28 GHz to 31 GHz bands, with an option to buy for $200 million by the end of 2018.XO’s spectrum covers some of the largest U.S. metro areas, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as Tampa, Fla. and Austin, Texas.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo commented on the XO deal at a Morgan Stanley conference on March 1.“Right now we have licenses issued to us from the FCC for trial purposes at 28 GHz. The XO deal gave us additional 28 GHz,” Shammo said. “The rental agreement enables us to include that (XO spectrum) in some of our R&D development with 28 GHz. So that just continues the path that we're on in launching 5G as soon as the FCC clears spectrum.”He noted that Japan and South Korea plan to test 5G services using 28 GHz and 39 GHz airwaves.Some analysts doubt 28 GHz airwaves will be on a fast track.“We are skeptical, not only on the timing of the availability of 28 GHz, but also its ultimate viability in a mobile wireless network,” Walter Piecyk, analyst at BTIG Research, said in a report.Boosting signal strength at higher frequencies is a challenge for wireless firms. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and also through walls, improving in-building services.One approach to increase propagation in millimeter wave bands, analysts say, is using more ""small-cell"" radio antennas, which increase network capacity.Wireless firms generally use large cell towers to connect mobile phone calls and whisk video and email to mobile phone users. They also install radio antennas on building rooftops, church steeples, or billboards. Suitcase-sized antennas used in small-cell technology are often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles.Verizon has been testing small-cell technology in Boston.Verizon says it will begin rolling out 5G commercially in 2017, though its plans are still vague. While many wireless service providers touted 5G plans and tests at the Mobile World Congress in February, makers of telecom network equipment are being cautious.“General consensus (at MWC) seemed to indicate that the 2020-time-frame will mark full-scale 5G deployments,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a report.Verizon has said it doesn't expect 5G networks to replace existing 4G ones.While 5G is expected to provide much faster data speeds, wireless firms also expect applications that require always-on, low-data-rate connections. The apps involve data-gathering from industrial sensors, home appliances and other devices often referred to as part of the Internet of Things.Both Verizon and AT&T (T) have recently touted 5G speeds up to 1-gigabit-per-second. That's roughly 50 times faster than the average speeds of 4G wireless networks in good conditions.AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson recently said 5G speeds could match fiber-optic broadband connections to homes.At the Morgan Stanley conference, Verizon's Shammo also said 5G could be a ""substitute product for broadband."" Regulators would like to create new competition for cable TV companies. But, Verizon says, it's still early days.""With trials, we'll figure out exactly what we can deliver, what the base cases are,"" said Shammo. ""5G has the capability to be a substitute for broadband into the home with a fixed wireless solution. The question is can you deploy that technology and actually make money at a price that the consumer would pay?""Sanyogita Shamsunder, Verizon’s director of network infrastructure planning, says high frequencies can support 5G.“Radio frequency components today are able to support much wider bandwidth (think wide lanes on the highway) when compared to even 10 years ago. What it means is we are able to pump more bits at the same time,” said Shamsunder, in an email.“Due to improvements in antenna and RF technology,” she added, “we are able to support 100s of small tiny antennas on a small die the size of a quarter.”

86,RF,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock gapped up to a 2016 high at the open Friday, after the Apple (AAPL) chip supplier late Thursday topped Wall Street's fiscal Q1 earnings-per-share expectations by 11 cents and issued Q2 guidance that edged analyst forecasts.Broadcom CEO Hock Tan hinted that Broadcom is already ramping for the likely September release of Apple's iPhone 7. He acknowledged that wireless demand declined 15% sequentially in Q1 on typical seasonality haunting ""our North American customer"" (i.e. Apple).Tan isn't alone. Last month, fellow Apple supplier Qorvo (QRVO) guided to weak Q4 sales, tugging Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) into a hole. But Tan expects Q2 to be the year's ""trough.""Broadcom stock was up 7% in early trading on the stock market today, above 146, on the fiscal Q1 beat, which followed the finalized acquisition of Broadcom by the former Avago Technologies on Feb. 1. The Q1 results relate solely to the former Avago, according to the company release, as the quarter ended Jan. 31, just before the deal was finalized.For fiscal Q1, Broadcom reported non-GAAP figures of $2.41 earnings per share on $1.78 billion in sales, up 15% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures topped the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.30 and $1.75 billion.During Q1, wired and enterprise storage sales grew 2% and 6%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Industrial sales fell 10% sequentially, trailing the 15% decline in wireless sales, Tan told analysts on the conference call.""Last year, we had unusually high demand in Q1 from a North American customer which offset normal seasonality,"" he said. ""This year, however -- as we all know -- seasonality returned and there was a product life cycle demand decline from that specific customer.""This week IDC issued a smartphone forecast that sees iPhone shipments declining 0.1% this year as smartphones running Alphabet's (GOOGL) Android operating system rise 7.6%.Tan said on Broadcom's conference call that he expects weak smartphone demand to reverse in the second half of 2016.Enterprise storage comprises 38% of the former Avago's total Q1 revenue -- the largest segment and leading wireless sales which contributed 32% to the total pot. But, the wired segment is growing and during the April quarter will bring in 55% of sales, Tan said.The midpoint of current-quarter guidance for $3.55 billion in sales on a non-GAAP basis, plus or minus $75 million, nearly touched the consensus model for $3.57 billion. Current-quarter sales views reflect the combined Avago-Broadcom company.During Q2, wireless and enterprise storage sales will shrink as chunks of total sales to 23% and 17%, respectively, Tan said. Still, all eyes are on Broadcom's ""North American customer"" which increased the chipmaker's RF content in its upcoming flagship smartphone, he said.""We are already pre-building significant quantities of our RF chips"" for the second-half of 2016 ramp, he said. ""We increase our RF content by 20% year after year in this high-end smartphone market.""But Tan expects greater strength in the wired segment where Broadcom expects to add new products. The segment will also benefit from increased enterprise demand.In May 2015, the former Avago announced a $37 billion bid for fellow Apple supplier Broadcom, kicking off a record-busting year of consolidation in the semiconductor industry amid macro weakness, slowing growth and ramping costs.Post-merger, the company retained Broadcom's name and Avago's ticker symbol ""AVGO."" Broadcom is one of two chipmakers on the IBD 50 list of top-rated growth stocks. The other is Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA).
"
87,RF,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan satisfied querying minds Thursday, claiming that further M&A following the $37 billion merger with fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies is ""furthest from our minds at this point.""Top-line growth will slow to 5% in the long term as Broadcom digests Avago, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote today in a research report. But the merged company's diversification -- which puts wired sales on top -- will help offset a wireless trough in Q2, he said.Ing retained his buy rating and boosted his price target to 162 from 160 on Broadcom stock, which was up 7%, around 147, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, touching a 2016 high.For its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 1 -- before the completed Feb. 1 merger -- Broadcom late Thursday reported non-GAAP figures of $2.41 earnings per share on $1.78 billion in sales, up 15% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus estimates of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were $2.30 and $1.75 billion.Current-quarter sales ex items guidance for $3.55 billion at the midpoint was slightly off the consensus model for $3.75 billion. Unlike Q1 figures, Q2 sales reflect the combined Avago-Broadcom company, Tan said on the company's earnings conference call.Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh credited Broadcom's 11-cent Q1 EPS beat to $30 million to $40 million in acquisition-related synergies. In total, Broadcom expects $750 million in synergies over 18 months. FBR analyst Christopher Rolland sees Broadcom exceeding that $750 million target.As Broadcom looks to shed smaller business units, the chipmaker expects to reduce quarterly operating expenses by $80 million. For the April quarter, Broadcom guided to $832 million in op-ex, below the consensus for $944 million, Ing wrote.Wired sales are expected to comprise 55% of Q2 revenue, leading wireless, enterprise storage and industrial sales at 23%, 17% and 5% of sales, respectively. The expectations flip Q1 results, where enterprise storage sales led with 38% of total revenue. Wireless, wired and industrial contributed 32%, 22% and 8%, respectively.During Q1, strong enterprise storage sales helped offset a 15% sequential decline in the wireless segment, Tan said. Wireless sales fell on wavering Apple iPhone demand, despite Samsung's Galaxy 7S ramp-up, but Tan expects to increase Broadcom's iPhone 7 content by 20%-plus after Q2.""Despite weaker-than-expected Q1 iPhone builds that have weighed on the entire Apple supply chain, Broadcom not only maintained its full-year RF (radio frequency) growth forecast, but raised it,"" Rolland wrote.Rolland maintained his outperform rating and 185 price target on Broadcom stock. Vinh rates Broadcom stock as overweight and has a 170 price target.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) were up a respective 6%, 5%, 3% and 2% in afternoon trading Friday, after Broadcom's Q1 earnings.

Apple for its part, rose 2% on Wednesday.For its December quarter, NXP is expected to report $1.29 billion in sales and $1.07 earnings per share ex items, down 16% and 21%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus view of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was relatively in line with NXP's three-months-ago guidance for a sales decline of ""low to mid-teens,"" sequentially.For the year, analysts model $5.78 billion in sales and $5.43 EPS minus items, up 2% and 14%, respectively, vs. 2014.Hari rates NXP stock a neutral as it continues realizing synergies from its recently completed acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.The merger reduced NXP's Apple exposure by essentially half, Hari noted. He expects NXP to mount up on its automotive content, expected to grow by 9% CAGR over the next three years. Advanced driver assistance systems, infotainment and autonomous vehicles will drive that growth.Late Thursday, Qorvo is expected to report $620.3 million in sales and 94 cents EPS ex items for its fiscal Q3. On a year-over-year basis, sales would dip 16% and EPS would be down 37%.Qorvo, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Dialog Semiconductor drove smartphone pressure with their negative pre-announcements late last year. Qorvo reduced its fiscal Q3 sales guide to $620 million from earlier views for $720 million to $730 million.The company didn't reduce its EPS ex items guide for $1.25 to $1.30.Hari downgraded Qorvo stock to neutral from a buy rating on its ""disadvantage to Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ... given (Qorvo's) ongoing integration and Skyworks' ability to leverage its portfolio of adjacent analog products to provide more complete solutions to handset (smartphone-makers).""Qorvo was created in January 2015 with the merger of RFMD and TriQuint, and competes against radio-frequency (RF) chip suppliers Skyworks and Avago Technologies (AVGO).RF content in smartphones is expected to grow 9% and 14% in 2016 and 2017, Hari estimated. That's against an 0.4% decline in smartphone unit growth in 2016 vs. 1.4% growth in 2015, he wrote.Although Qorvo's portfolio is more complete post-merger, Hari questioned the timeline on synergies. The company guided to $150 million in synergies in 2017 with $75 million realized in 2015.

117,RF,"Home robot maker iRobot (IRBT) revealed Wednesday that it is developing a robotic lawn mower, but cautioned that it's not close to being released.IRobot CEO Colin Angle confirmed media reports about the lawn mowing robot on a conference call with analysts Wednesday. IRobot's plans were first exposed in documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The Bedford, Mass.-based company received an FCC waiver to test radio-frequency beacons that would be used to help navigate the robot lawn mower.Scientists at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory have objected to iRobot's proposal to use radio waves to guide lawn mowers. They say the devices could interfere with the sensitive radio telescopes they use to scan the heavens, Bloomberg reported.IRobot's current plan is to use a series of radio transmitters mounted on 2-foot lawn spikes to define the boundary of an owner's lawn, BetaBoston reported.""As far as the public disclosure of our interest in using wideband RF beacons for a lawn mowing-related product, yes, that's going on,"" Angle said. ""That's not an imminent product, but it is a normal part of a product development cycle.""IRobot is working to ensure that its outdoor navigation technology is FCC compliant, Angle said.IRobot wouldn't be the first. Companies currently making autonomous lawn mowers include Husqvarna, Robomow, Honda Motor (HMC) and Deere (DE).Best known for its Roomba robot vacuum cleaner, iRobot also makes robots for mopping floors, cleaning pools and clearing gutters. On top of all that, it makes reconnaissance and bomb-disposal robots for military and police.Q1 Earnings BeatLate Tuesday, iRobot reported Q1 earnings that beat estimates. It earned 16 cents a share, down 11% year over year, on sales of $118 million, up 3%.

Qualcomm stock closed up 3.5% at 47.73.Stoss cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 100 from 125 after shares fell to a 14-month low Wednesday on Apple supplier Multi-Fineline Electronix's (MFLX) soft Q4 sales guidance.Multi-Fineline stock crashed 22% on Wednesday, hitting an 11-month low, after the company guided to $169 million in Q4 sales vs. its previous views for $170 million to $200 million. The company blamed soft smartphone sales for the floundering view. Shares rebounded 15.6% Thursday.Poor Apple iPhone sales will undoubtedly smudge Skyworks' top line, says Stoss, but he sees the company benefiting from a 15%-20% boost in RF content per unit over the next year and two-year visibility on all flagship phones.""Moreover, we believe the new features rumored to come in the iPhone 7 this fall could re-accelerate iPhone unit growth quickly, turning Apple headwinds into Apple tailwinds,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Samsung is preparing to ramp its Galaxy S7, which should benefit Qualcomm, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report Thursday.

In September, Qualcomm reported an 18% year-over-year sales dip as a result of companies' reluctance to enter new government-approved contracts.The new contracts ""should enable Qualcomm to receive currently due and retroactive royalty and licensing payments,"" Kelleher wrote.Still, Qualcomm stock has pulled back 5% since New Year's Day after falling 33% in 2015, lagging the 8% gain of its 43-company IBD Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.But Kelleher is more positive on Qualcomm stock than is Craig-Hallum's Stoss. The market tends to overlook Qualcomm's positives and on Wednesday largely shrugged at the TDK alliance, Kelleher wrote.""In December, we wrote that, given all the M&A in semiconductors, we would not be surprised to see Qualcomm make a major acquisition,"" he wrote. ""Formation of the RF360 Holdings JV spares Qualcomm the expense of a major asset buy while positioning the company to meaningfully increase its content per device.""Kelleher maintained his buy rating on Qualcomm stock but cut his price target to 70 from 80.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

153,RF,"Chipmakers have seen better days, but Integrated Device Technology stands out among chip stocks. With the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down about 4% so far this year, many chip firms are trading well off of their highs. Integrated Device (IDTI), however, has gained 40% year to date.According to Chief Executive Greg Waters, the San Jose, Calif.-based company has seen ""unprecedented"" new product releases since just this spring, and they're carrying higher margins than the products they've replaced.""We have products for data centers; we have products for communications infrastructure; and we have select consumer focuses such as wireless charging,"" Waters told Investor's Business Daily. ""All three have had major product releases and advances over the last six months.""Integrated Device's data center products are its largest category, and it's seeing the highest dollar growth there. But the greatest sector growth is coming from wireless charging.The company is benefiting from a boom in the adoption of its wireless charging technology, most notably by Samsung, with the Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Note5 smartphones among its products with the capability.Making A BetWaters said that as of two years ago, Integrated Device wasn't even on the approved vendor list with Samsung Mobile. But the smartphone maker ""made a real bet"" to make wireless charging mainstream, according to Waters.""They took the plunge and put it in their high-volume smartphones, and it's been very successful for them,"" he said.Integrated Device's wireless-charging product line brought in $15 million last quarter, whereas the business was nonexistent two years ago. In partnership with one of its distributors, Digi-Key, Integrated Device has sponsored a competition to create wireless-charging applications beyond smartphones, using its developer kit.Already, the company is providing built-in charging stations on PC monitors for Samsung, as well as chargers built into furniture made by Ikea. Looking forward, Integrated Device says the devices could be used for such applications as law enforcement body cams.""(It) has the same type of broad footprint appeal as Bluetooth,"" Waters says of wireless charging.Integrated Device shares are trading at 13-year highs, with the stock rallying about 80% from its Aug. 24 low, reached as the general market sold off.The company is faring better than many of its peers supplying chips to Apple (AAPL). One Apple supplier, ARM Holdings (ARMH), is trading 10% off of its high, while another, Avago Technologies (AVGO), is 16% off its high.Integrated Device hit a slump of nearly 10 quarters of earnings and sales declines in 2012-2013 — with earnings down as much as 74% at one point — but the company started to turn around as it focused its strategy around select categories: analog and mixed-signal, timing and interconnect, and (RF) and power.Double-Digit GrowthIn its 2016 second-quarter report, released Oct. 26, Integrated Device earned an adjusted 35 cents a share, up 75% from last year and topping analyst estimates for 32 cents. Revenue jumped 24% to $169.5 million, beating views for $168.9 million.In part because of that strong financial performance, Integrated Device boasts a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It's a member of the IBD 50, which ranks leading stocks based on such key measures as growth in earnings, sales, margins, return on equity and relative price performance.Its third-quarter revenue guidance of $169 million to $177 million came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts for $165 million. Morgan Stanley analyst Blayne Curtis noted in an Oct. 27 report that the top line is seeing a boost from a rebound in its communications business segment, likely due to strong orders from Huawei, a Chinese telecom gear and smartphone maker.Integrated Device is in the process of making a strategic acquisition that opens up a new growth market for itself, announcing during its latest quarterly report that it's buying out privately held Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden, known as ZMDI, for $310 million.ZMDI makes analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products for the automotive, industrial, medical, (IT) and consumer markets, and has its U.S. operations in Milpitas, Calif., near Integrated Device.In addition to giving Integrated Device ""immediate leverage for new designs in wireless charging, power management, and timing and signal conditioning,"" the company also sees a ""significant"" new growth opportunity with the acquisition of ZMDI's automotive and industrial business. The acquisition is expected to close before the end of the year.""It immediately opens up a channel with their existing automotive business,"" Waters said.That could help it compete with automotive-related chipmakers NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) and Nvidia (NVDA).On top of the acquisition, Integrated Device also announced a $300 million increase in its buyback program, bringing its total authorization to over $520 million.Strong Cash FlowWaters says this is achievable because of the company's strong cash flow position.""We're a small-cap company, but we have cash flow performance rivaling the large caps,"" Waters said, adding that ""only a small handful"" of large caps have a free cash flow as good as (IDT)'s, which as a percentage of revenue is 27% for the trailing four quarters.But Integrated Device's success isn't without risks.""Wireless charging is still a nascent feature on smartphones,"" said Dougherty & Co. analyst Charles Anderson in an Oct. 27 research note. Anderson added: ""We still don't know if consumers see this as a must-have feature, as it hasn't been incorporated on any 'hit' phones, other than maybe the Nexus 4.""Apple, one of the biggest smartphone makers in the world, has not largely adopted wireless charging technology aside from its magnetic Apple Watch charger. In an iFixit teardown of the charging device, the group speculated that the technology Apple used was in-house.When asked about Apple's plans in the wireless charging space, Waters had no comment.Looking ahead, Integrated Device expects to continue to grow through its new classes of products, boosted by the ZMDI acquisition.Waters said another acquisition is ""unlikely"" for the foreseeable future. It would need to ""be a better use of cash than buying back our own shares.""

154,RF,"Avago Technologies stock jumped late Wednesday after the Apple supplier reported fiscal Q4 earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, with full-year fiscal 2015 EPS jumping 83% from fiscal 2014.Wireless sales growth helped push fiscal 2015 revenue to a record, Avago (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan said during the company's earnings conference call with analysts.Shares were up 7.5% in after-hours trading, after the supplier of chips to Apple (AAPL) and other mobile device makers released its earnings. Shares of fellow Apple chip suppliers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were both up more than 1% after hours.Broadcom (BRCM) stock was up 4.5%. In May, Avago agreed to buy Broadcom for $37 billion, but Avago hasn't said when it expects that deal, the largest chip merger ever, to close.For its Q4, which ended Oct. 31, Avago reported $1.853 billion in non-GAAP sales and $2.51 earnings per share ex items, up 15% and 26%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Non-GAAP sales narrowly beat the $1.85 billion consensus estimate of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, but EPS ex items easily topped analyst views of $2.38.For the fiscal year, Avago smashed records with $6.9 billion in non-GAAP sales, up 60% from fiscal 2014. EPS ex items jumped to $8.98, topping the $8.84 analyst estimate.Wireless sales accounted for 37% of Avago's Q4 sales and rose 10% sequentially during the seasonally strong quarter as ""our North American customer"" ramped its flagship smartphone, Tan told analysts. He was almost certainly speaking of Apple, but not by name.Enterprise storage sales accounted for 35% of Q4 sales, rising 9% from Q3, Tan said.Wireless Weakness To Hit Q1For fiscal Q1, ending Jan. 31, Avago guided to $1.768 billion in sales, plus or minus $25 million — the midpoint slightly short of Wall Street forecasts for $1.82 billion. That would be up 8% year over year at the midpoint but would mark the company's smallest gain since the July 2013 quarter.""Unlike last year, we do see a seasonal decline in Q1 demand and expect our wireless revenue to decline in the low teens,"" Tan said. ""Last year, Q1 (wireless) demand held out, offsetting seasonal declines. We don't see that phenomenon this year.""Avago's industrial sales, which fell 10% sequentially in Q4, will be down again sequentially in Q1 by low single digits, Tan said. Enterprise storage and wired infrastructure are expected to be up slightly, sequentially.Teardowns show Avago radio-frequency (RF) chips in Apple iPhones. Again without identifying his customer by name, Tan said that Avago ""had to walk away from supplying additional RF content"" in a new smartphone model ""because of constrained manufacturing. That will not happen again.""Many analysts predict a decline in Q1 unit sales for the iPhone, and other Apple suppliers have noted as much during their September-quarter conference calls.Tan, though, predicts a 20% increase in Avago RF content in the next smartphone from the unnamed North American customer — i.e., Apple. Analysts questioned that growth prediction.""Not many people can do it,"" Tan said. But ""content keeps going in that range, and we're always able to capture that. That is a broad trend in the smartphone market, and we do not see that changing in the next three years.""Avago stock fell a fraction in Wednesday's regular session but is up 31% for the year.

But for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C), it's just another storm cloud.Bank of America and other major banks have been counting on higher interest rates to widen the spread between their short-term borrowing costs and their long-term lending rates.

""In fact, we believe Skyworks increased its dollar content in Samsung's Galaxy S6 vs. the S5 and is well positioned to keep and potentially increase its content share in the next generation (Apple) iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models.""Matthew Ramsay, another Canaccord analyst, wrote that Cavium is in good shape in the wireless infrastructure, security and data center markets.""Long term, we anticipate continued strong sales growth for core wireless infrastructure, security, data center and server products driven by increased capital spending trends focused in areas Cavium differentiates: high-bandwidth packet processing, deep packet inspection, application-specific hardware acceleration and security,"" he wrote. ""We anticipate sustainable 20%-plus top-line growth with operating expense growth less than half of top-line growth long-term, yielding considerable leverage.""

231,RF,"The Big Cap 20 is showing itself to be a good representation of today's market leadership, as technology, health care and consumer stocks dominate the list.A glance of the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables shows chips, medical, apparel, retail and other technology sectors make up most of the top 10 sectors. That's a fitting reflection of what you find in the Big Cap 20. Most of the 20 stocks can be categorized in one of those areas.In technology, a couple of chipmakers rank among the leading big caps, along with some business-service tech companies.Analog Devices (ADI) is one of the more interesting charts. The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base on Feb. 17 and has risen 3% from that entry.The chipmaker earned 63 cents a share excluding items for the January-ended quarter, beating expectations. Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%. Sales rose 18% to $2.08 billion.Mylan forecast 2015 revenues of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion.In consumer stocks, the big cap leaders run the gamut of auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Starbucks (SBUX) and discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST).Ross Stores shined Friday as its earnings report sent shares gapping up to a 7% gain and a record high.For the first two months of 2015, the Big Cap 20 has acquitted itself quite satisfactorily. It rose 6.9%, far better than the 2.2% gain for the S&P 500, which is a broad gauge of big-capitalization stocks.Qorvo (QRVO) may be an unfamiliar name on a list filled with familiar brands.

273,RF,"Following Cree's (CREE) announcement Thursday that it is voluntarily recalling its tube-shaped T8 fluorescent lamps, one analyst questions whether consumers will shy away from purchasing the LED lights.The North Carolina-based lighting manufacturer said the problem with the T8 LEDs stems from electrical resistance between a spring contact and the printed circuit board. The resistance can lead to electrical arcing, which can cause the light to overheat and melt, posing fire and burn hazards.The T8 LEDs are sold through distributors to commercial lighting customers, and exclusively at Home Depot (HD) for residential usage. Owners of those bulbs should disconnect them and contact Cree for a free replacement or a refund.Cree said its LED light is designed to replace fluorescent bulbs in common commercial and office fixtures. The company estimates the recall affects roughly 700,000 lights in the U.S. and 11,500 in Canada.It might well be just a one-time recall, but its impact could be more far-reaching, Summit Research Partners analyst Srini Sundararajan said in a research report Friday.""This might make consumers who need to be convinced to use LED-based lamps a little bit gun shy in making the change from traditional lamps,"" Sundararajan said. ""However, with good crisis management on the part of the company, any long-term impact can be minimized.""The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission website has posted a recall notice on the LED T8 fluorescent tubes.Cree provides contact information about the recall on its website .Cree stock was down 1% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 30.""We believe that these may have retailed for $22, which means that the impact of the recall and refund is likely to be around $15 million, only if strictly evaluated in terms of monetary impact,"" said Sundararajan, who reiterated his price target of 25 and hold rating on Cree stock.Cree announced last month that it will spin off its Power and Radio-Frequency Products subsidiary in an initial public offering. Cree said it submitted a draft registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO but didn't disclose how much it plans to raise from the IPO or how many shares it will sell or the price.Cree said that IPO would allow the company to focus on its LED and lighting businesses. The Power and RF division is Cree's smallest business unit. According to the SEC filing, Frank Plastina, a Cree board member, will be the interim executive vice president of the division, effective Monday, and will serve as CEO of the company after the IPO.RELATED:Acuity Brands Brightens With Commercial LED Light Use.

348,RF,"June gloom settled firmly over the market Friday as stocks opened to scant losses despite better-than-expected May jobs data.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average deflated 0.1% apiece. Volume rose 27% on the Nasdaq and 4% on the NYSE, vs. action at the same time Thursday.While there was much anticipation ahead of Friday's May payrolls report, Greece's debt deadline and the biannual meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the stock market today showed little reaction to developments any of the three fronts. Payrolls topped expectations, and the unemployment rate increased as job-seekers flooded back into the labor pool. Greece delayed its payment to the International Monetary Fund, rolling its four comparatively smaller payments into a $1.5 billion lump sum now due at the end of the month, significantly increasing the odds of a default. OPEC kept its overall production target unchanged and offered no suggestion that members producing above their quota levels — an issue that could send prices lower over the next few months — would be penalized.Oil and financial issues were the only stocks showing gains on the Dow. JPMorgan (JPM) topped the index with a 1.5% gain. Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) rose a bit more than 1%, the largest advance among Nasdaq 100 stocks.Financials also topped the S&P 500. Alabama-based Regions Financial (RF) jumped nearly 4%. Charles Schwab (SCHW) trimmed its initial gap-up gain to near 3%.China's JA Solar Holdings (JASO) soared 13% out of the starting gate. The company reported that a bid by Chairman and Chief Executive Baofang Jin to buy all outstanding company shares valued the company near $490 million. The announcement came just as European regulators imposed tariffs on China-based solar component plays, including Canadian Solar (CSIQ), ET Solar and ReneSola (SOL), a penalty for violating a 2013 pact allowing them to trade in the European Union at reduced tariffs.Among IBD 50 stocks, the Israel-based CyberArk Software (CYBR) jumped nearly 3% in early action. The gain puts the network security software developer a bit less than 9% from a 69.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) led the list's downside, dropping more than 3% in very strong trade.

349,RF,"Third-stage entries have a spotty record, but big-cap chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) keeps trying to make it work. Breakouts from a first- or second-stage consolidation are more likely to work than those from later patterns. However, sometimes the third-stage base beats the odds. After TriQuint's merger with RF Micro Devices on Jan. 2, the new company named itself Qorvo. The stock…
"
350,RF,"Qorvo CEO Bob Bruggeworth is leading a new management team working to integrate two chipmakers' products and cultures, leverage their combined strengths and define long-term technology and product road maps.He'll draw on 31 years of experience to accomplish the challenge.The name Qorvo (QRVO) might not ring a bell. RF Micro Devices, also called RFMD, agreed in February 2014 to acquire TriQuint Semiconductor for about $1.6 billion.The deal, billed as a merger of equals, culminated a five-year courtship. The pair officially merged as of Jan. 1 under the new name.Qorvo battles Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Avago Technologies (AVGO) among the top radio-frequency chip suppliers.Bruggeworth first delved into semiconductors while building transistors in college.""Most of my classes were taught by professors who worked at an RCA fab,"" Bruggeworth said.He started his career in 1983 at Santa Ana, Calif.-based Accelerated Memory Production, or AMP, where he began working on sockets for integrated circuits.""Before I left AMP to join RF Micro Devices in 1999, I was responsible for AMP's global computer and consumer electronics business based in Hong Kong,"" he said. He moved to RF Micro for ""the opportunity to move from wired to wireless technologies.""In June 2002, Bruggeworth was named president of RF Micro Devices. Seven months later, he added the CEO title.Bruggeworth recently spoke with IBD about Qorvo, which is set to release Q4 earnings after the close Wednesday.IBD: What's the merger's goal?Bruggeworth: We see the merger creating a new leader in RF (radio-frequency chip) solutions. Qorvo is highly diversified, with greater than $2 billion in annualized revenue and expertise in mobile devices, complex infrastructure and global defense applications. These are robust markets with strong long-term prospects, and we have a goal of outpacing our markets' underlying growth rates of approximately 10% to 15%. We've assembled a world-class team with a legacy of innovation and a sharp focus on superior financial results, and we believe we can achieve our target operating model of 50% gross margin and 30% operating margin within two years while posting above-market growth.IBD: Why the name Qorvo?Bruggeworth: Since this was a merger of equals, we wanted to create a new name for the company. Qorvo (pronounced ""kor-vo"") isn't a name that existed before, so we have an opportunity to create a new brand from a clean sheet of paper.The name combines the words ""core"" and ""voyage."" Qorvo delivers the core technologies so that our customers can launch their next-generation designs faster. The second part of the name, ""vo"" for ""voyage,"" evokes moving through air or space.IBD: How do the two companies' technologies and products complement one another?Bruggeworth: RFMD and TriQuint served many of the same markets and had developed some very complementary technologies. We have core strengths in system design, semiconductor processing, advanced packaging, high-volume manufacturing and strategic foundry services, and we are capable of serving both high-volume commercial and defense customers.That said, there was surprisingly little overlap in our product portfolios. So as Qorvo, we can combine our many strengths — in areas like premium filters, switches, antenna tuners, power amplifiers and power management — to offer our customers RF solutions that are much more highly integrated and much more valuable.IBD: Will the companies have one headquarters at RF Micro's home base in Greensboro, N.C.?Bruggeworth: Qorvo will have dual headquarters in Greensboro and (TriQuint's home base) Hillsboro, Ore. We're a global company with dozens of locations and thousands of customers around the world. Our leadership team is distributed across Greensboro and Hillsboro, as well as in other locations globally, and we use technologies like TelePresence videoconferencing to help bridge time and distance, and create a sense of being in one location.IBD: What is your goal in cost savings?Bruggeworth: We are committed to $150 million in cost synergies within two years of the merger; $75 million in annualized synergies exiting the first year after closing; and an additional $75 million exiting the second year.IBD: What are market trends and your revenue drivers looking like?Bruggeworth: The underlying trends in the markets we serve — mobile, infrastructure and defense — are positive, particularly in the applications we make possible. The demand for mobile data is growing, and Qorvo is very well positioned with the core technologies necessary to help our customers accelerate their products to market.Whether you're talking about mobile devices, radar/avionics systems or communication infrastructure like base stations, point-to-point radio links or optical and cable networks, Qorvo is helping to connect people, networks and things, both wirelessly and over wired networks.IBD: As smartphones become more complex, is more RF content needed? Premium filters, switches and modules?Bruggeworth: Yes. Half of the world's handsets shipping today are 2G and average significantly less than $1 of RF content. With the increasing global demand for mobile data and the migration to 4G, that's increasing to significant dollars of RF content per device over a multiyear period.Consumers in all geographies want their mobile devices to deliver longer battery life, broader coverage, increased throughput, greater functionality and overall improved performance.To achieve this, smartphone manufacturers are adding new LTE bands to their devices, and the cellular industry is supporting new technologies, like envelope tracking, carrier aggregation and, later, transmit MIMO (multiple input multiple output, an antenna technology for wireless communications in which multiple antennas are used at both the source \ and the destination \) to enrich the user experience.For Qorvo, that's driving incremental demand for our RF content, primarily premium filters, switches and tuners, as well as our power amplifiers.

Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK). Alaska is one of three airline stocks on the Bolting RS Lines screen, along with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

Other customers include action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO).Q4 earnings per share excluding items were $1.12, up 75%, for the eighth consecutive quarter of rising year-over-year EPS gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $682 million in revenue and EPS of $1.08.The Woburn, Mass.-based company said that it expects revenue to climb 52% in the December quarter to $770 million, with EPS ex items to rise 76% to $1.18.Analysts had been expecting EPS of $1.08 on sales of $718 million.For the fiscal year, Skyworks' revenue rose 28% to $2.3 billion and EPS ex items rose 47% to $3.24.$3 Billion Run-Rate""We are now scaling to more than a $3 billion revenue run-rate with annualized non-GAAP earnings per share approaching $5,"" company CFO Donald Palette said in a statement.Skyworks' better-than-expected outlook comes as a result of its ""strong leverage to the tier-1 handset OEMs and emerging market 4G rollout, end-market diversification, operational excellence, high-performance analog design wins, solid cash generation and relative valuation,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely told IBD.In Q4, Skyworks showed its diversity by providing chips for a wide range of clients and uses. It provided chips for General Motors (GM) collision-avoidance systems and for GPS applications to support avionics for Rockwell Collins (COL). Its chips were in thermostat and lighting platforms made by General Electric (GE) and video cameras from recent hot IPO GoPro.Skyworks is among several radio-frequency chipmakers that analysts say are well-positioned as suppliers for Apple iPhones and iPads. Others include two firms that are merging, RF Micro Devices (RFMD) and TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT).""We are enabling the global adoption of connectivity in all its forms and across all applications and end markets,"" Skyworks CEO David Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.""This powerful and secular megatrend is in the early innings and is spanning diverse markets like mobile, the connected home, media, security, computing, enterprise and networking across a number of communications protocols. These include 4G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee and others,"" Aldrich said.Growing DemandSkyworks is benefiting from the growing need for complex analog chips that can handle higher data-rate connectivity standards in smartphones from Apple, Samsung and others. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley says that Skyworks increased its dollar content share by more than 10% in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus compared with the iPhone 5s/5c models. He added that the company remains ""a key leading RF supplier to Apple.""Skyworks is also tapping into the Internet of Things trend, where household appliances, cars and other items are wirelessly connected to the Internet. Skyworks said that it expanded its chip designs for wearables in Q4, including three new smartwatch programs, though it didn't identify the smartwatch makers.The company's chips enable control systems inside cars that allow drivers to activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting and security systems remotely. The global connected car market Transparency Market Research is expected to reach $131.9 billion by 2019, growing at a compound annual growth rate near 35%, as was reported in October.Skyworks is seeing new opportunities for its connectivity chips due to the rise in popularity of streaming music and video, mobile payment systems and cloud-based applications. Skyworks says that its chips will be used in wireless audio speakers from Bose and Sonos, for streaming music and for video networks.Skyworks stock rose 2.1% in Thursday's regular session to 62.14, a more than 14-year high for the fourth consecutive day.

480,RF,"ChipmakerSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) is poised to significantly expand its global presence as well as its profit margins over the next two years, according to an analyst report released late Monday.As Chinese telecom carriers transition from 2G phones to 3G smartphones and 4G LTE wireless broadband services for customers, Skyworks is likely to have a strong presence in what will be a big market.""We anticipate a growing global mix of LTE smartphones and Skyworks' share gains with leading Chinese OEMs should drive 15% plus sales growth into the smartphone market over the next two years,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley in a research report. ""The potential dollar content available for Skyworks increases from roughly 30 cents to 50 cents in a 2G phone to $2 to $3 in a lower-end 3G smartphone to $4 to $6 for a midtier LTE smartphone and to $10-plus for high-end global LTE smartphones,"" he said.Walkley increased his target price on Skyworks stock to 62 from 55, and reiterated a buy rating.Skyworks stock was flat, near 52, in midday trading in the stock market today, but shares are up more than 80% this year for a company that has been in the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks for weeks, as well as an IBD Leaderboard stock.""Given Skyworks' broad RFIC (radio frequency integrated circuit) portfolio and customer base, we believe Skyworks' diverse analog portfolio is enabling content share gains in its smartphone customer base,"" Walkley said. ""Further, we anticipate strong ongoing sales to Wi-Fi 802.11ac, wireless infrastructure, and the IoT (Internet of Things) markets should contribute to strong sales and improving margins.""The report was released after meetings with Don Palette, Skyworks' chief financial officer, at a Canaccord investor conference last week.The Woburn, Mass.-based company has a diverse portfolio of analog chips used in cars, broadband gear, cellular infrastructure, energy management, GPS devices, smartphones and tablets.Skyworks chips are used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung Galaxy F4 and F5, but recently its chip growth is being driven in part by fitness wearables, such as Philips ' (PHG) wearable technologies and wellness applications, and by home automation, JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna told IBD.""They're in a lot of new automobile applications,"" Gauna said. ""The automobile is so sensor-intensive now, with a lot of RF (radio frequency) and analog content that Skyworks can provide.""New product launches and an aggressive push into new markets have helped drive recent revenue growth. For its fiscal Q3 ended June 30, Skyworks posted year-over-year revenue growth of 35%, its biggest growth in more than three years.""While we understand investor concerns regarding slowing smartphone/handset unit sales growth, we believe investors do not fully appreciate Skyworks' diverse content opportunities, increasing mix of higher-margin integrated mobile solutions vs. stand-alone power amplifiers, and improving competitive position,"" Walkley said.Skyworks products, for instance, will help enable navigation-assist capabilities in some of next year's Volkswagen (VLKAY) models and will go into Ericsson's (ERIC) 4G LTE mobile broadband base stations. Skyworks chips are going into enhanced video-streaming applications for TV set-top boxes, Blu-ray/ DVD players and LED/4K television.Skyworks also sees promising opportunities in medical devices, gaming platforms and industrial markets.RELATED:Worldwide smartphone market grows in Q2.

The opportunity for Skyworks, he adds, depends on the number of iPhones Apple sells.He cites Apple's Sept. 22 announcement that it sold over 10 million new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, a record, just three days after the launch Sept. 19.""Apple is always a big catalyst for all smartphone component suppliers,"" Rakesh said.Stock Amps UpSkyworks' stock on Sept. 19 notched its highest closing price since 2000, ending at 57.68 after the Apple iPhone 6 teardown news. It closed up 3.4% Wednesday to 58.84. But Skyworks powered up well before the Apple iPhone 6 debut. It has gained 106% this year.In an interview with IBD, Skyworks CEO David Aldrich would not comment on whether Skyworks is a supplier for the iPhone 6, although the iFixit teardowns found the technology inside.""I am not at liberty to comment about specific companies,"" he said. ""But Skyworks has become very successful at increasing our content with all of our smartphone customers.""Skyworks develops and manufacturers high-performance analog semiconductor products. Its portfolio includes amplifiers, attenuators, battery chargers, circulators, DC/DC converters, demodulators, detectors, diodes, directional couplers and infrastructure RF (radio frequency) subsystems.Its semiconductors enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets and other devices.Leveraging core technologies, Skyworks supports automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, energy management, GPS, industrial, medical, military, wireless networking, smartphone and tablet applications.Skyworks has been on a roll on the financial front. It's seen double-digit sales and earnings growth in all but one of the past seven quarters. Its growth accelerated in the most recent quarter to the fastest pace since mid-2011. Earnings rose 54% to 83 cents a share. Sales climbed 35% to $587 million.Connectivity Is The KeyWhat's been fueling growth at Skyworks?""Fortunately for us, the growth is being driven from both a market and product standpoint,"" Aldrich told IBD. ""We've worked very hard over the past decade to diversify our business into a broader set of markets and to produce more products and solutions. At the core is connectivity in all its forms, whether that is through a smartphone or an automobile or the home, which is becoming increasingly connected in many ways.""He said on a July conference call for Q3 of fiscal 2014: ""Our business results are being fueled by a surge in global adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. We are riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces, all enabled by the availability of efficient, high-performance connectivity solutions.""Among these forces, he said, are ""the enabling of billions of unconnected users with first-time Internet access in the emerging economies; advancing new forms of content delivery, such as streaming music services, on-demand media and over-the-content distribution; and supporting cloud services and mobile ecommerce.""Skyworks' technology has its largest presence in smartphones, Aldrich told IBD.In the past couple of quarters, smartphones and tablets have been big growth drivers, he adds, whether it's increasing Skyworks' content in these products by providing more complete solutions or by gaining market share.""In general, smartphones are becoming more complicated and complex,"" he said. ""They need to operate over many frequencies having more functionality.""Skyworks provides a lot of the technology that goes into the more sophisticated smartphones such as solutions that support GPS and high-resolution cameras.Another growth driver: ""Skyworks has been very successful at capturing developing economic markets like China and penetrating new regions of the world that are deploying connectivity in a big way,"" said Aldrich.He points out that Skyworks is penetrating markets outside Europe and North America, with many Chinese buying smartphones for the first time.As for the future: ""Skyworks is entering a new and exciting growth phase driven by global wireless proliferation and the Internet of Things,"" said Aldrich in a statement announcing Q3 results. ""Quite simply, we are capitalizing on the macro trend to connect virtually everyone and everything, all the time. Our high-performance analog solutions and system-level integration capabilities coupled with our operational agility and scalability are enabling us to connect the previously unconnected.""Skyworks is a part of IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group, with a 99 out of a possible 99.Key customers include Cisco Systems (CSCO), General Electric (GE), Google (GOOGL), Honeywell (HON), Nokia (NOK) and Samsung Electronics.

As the volume of online purchases from Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY) and others ramps up, Kapstone provides packaging to ship those goods around the world.It carries a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters. Analysts project a 114% EPS rise this quarter.San Jose, Calif.-based Ubiquiti Networks makes radios, antennas and other gear for radio frequency, or RF, service providers. Ubiquiti grew rapidly last year selling its wireless network products to large companies and underserved rural Internet service providers (ISPs) around the globe.Ubiquiti says its goal is ""closing the digital divide by building network communication platforms for everyone and everywhere.""
