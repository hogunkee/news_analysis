0,SJM,"Shares of General Mills (GIS) sank Wednesday after the Cheerios and Yoplait maker delivered mixed results and lowered its growth outlook citing significant cost headwinds.General Mills' dive spread contagion through the packaged food sector, taking down shares of Kellogg (K), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Campbell Soup (CPB), J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM), ConAgra (CAG) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup hit the sector last month on their weak quarterly reports.Shares of General Mills plunged 8.85% to 45.51 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in nearly five years. General Mills is by far the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.They have tumbled since their Jan. 25 high of 60.69. Kellogg crashed 4%. Kraft Heinz lost 1.9%, hitting its worst levels since August 2015, while Campbell Soup sank 2.2%, reaching a 4-year low. Mondelez slid 0.8% and J.M. Smucker retreated 4.2%.Kellogg, J.M. Smucker, Campbell Soup and ConAgra all were among the S&P 500 index's worst-performers.The Minneapolis-based company reported adjusted quarterly profit grew 10% to 79 cents per share, meeting the Zacks Investment Research consensus estimate. Revenue ticked up 2% to $3.88 billion, just short of views for $3.89 billion. Organic net sales — stripping out the effect of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures — were up 1%.Cost pressures are impacting the full-year outlook, said General Mills Chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening. General Mills cut its adjusted earnings growth forecast to flat to up 1% from up 3% to 4% earlier.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Like the broader industry, we're seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities,"" Harmening added. ""Because of our improved volume performance, we're also incurring higher operational costs.""Net sales for the North America retail segment rose 1% to $2.52 billion, thanks in large part to Canada. Yogurt and cereal sales fell in the U.S.Sales in the convenience stores and food service segment rose 3% to $460 million, driven by growth in frozen meals, cereal, and snacks.Europe and Australia sales grew 11% to $470 million, benefiting from favorable currency moves. Organic net sales slipped 1%.Asia and Latin America sales increased 3% to $435 million, also helped by foreign currency exchange. Organic net sales matched year-ago levels.  Asia markets saw higher sales, offsetting lower net sales across Latin America.General Mills said Wednesday its previously announced $8 billion acquisition of natural pet food brand Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) is expected to close before the end of fiscal 2018. Natural, wholesome and premium fare is in demand in pet food, as in human food, according to General Mills.Packaged food is under strain as private-label house brands as well as organic and natural offerings displace mainstream products on grocery shelves at the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods.Walmart is General Mills' biggest customer, accounting for some 20% of sales.Packaged food companies have responded with cost cuts, including on marketing, to preserve profit margins, but that strategy is running out of steam. Kraft Heinz's latest results show the cost-cutting strategy is running out of steam.Blue Buffalo shares edged 0.3% lower Wednesday. Walmart rose 0.3%, Amazon dipped 0.3%. and Kroger added 0.2%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Forget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish; S&P 500, Dow Jones Futures Await Fed Rate HikeThe Big Picture: Stock Bounce Leaves Much To Be DesiredNo. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthThese 5 Top Stocks Stood Out MondayThese 3 China Nets Are Flashing This Bullish Signal; This 1 Has Earnings Due'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

Smucker's sales disappointed Wall Street on weakness in pet food and coffee. The package food sector is consolidating, and shares of some companies have soared recently amid increased M&A activity.Smucker's coffee revenue of $513.3 million in Q1 was down from $565 million a year earlier, in part on weak Dunkin' (DNKN) K-Cup pods sales and lower net prices. Sales of Kibbles 'n Bits, Meow Mix and other pet food  products collectively fell 6% to $519.5 million, in part on difficult comps vs. strong sales of new brands a year before.However, the company expects to achieve $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year as it consolidates after divestments and recent acquisitions, such as Meow Mix maker Big Heart Pet Brands, which it acquired in March 2015.Smucker maintained it outlook for full-year adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.75, the midpoint of which is a little below analysts' consensus for $7.70.

For Reckitt Benckiser, unloading the products continues an overhaul that began with an expansion into baby formula through the British company's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.The transaction price equates to 20 times the division's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, ""which feels to us like a very high price for a U.S.-oriented ambient food business,"" James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He expects the transaction to dilute RB's earnings per share by about 1%.The deal comes as speculation swirls about the next round of consolidation in the packaged-food business. In February, Kraft Heinz (KHC) was spurned in a blockbuster bid to take over Unilever (UL), the British-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soup. In the aftermath, Unilever was cited by analysts as a possible bidder for the Reckitt business.Nestle SA, the world's largest food company, is also shaking up its portfolio. Under activist pressure to improve results, it's considering selling its U.S. candy operations. Investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management this week set its sights on Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. giant that competes with Unilever in personal care.Led by Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt said it was looking to unload its food business in April, when the Slough, England-based company described the division as ""non-core."" With 411 million pounds ($536 million) in sales last year, French's Foods accounted for 4% of Reckitt's total revenue.French's and Frank's RedHot will become McCormick's second- and third-largest brands, respectively, CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a statement late Tuesday. McCormick's pro forma 2017 annual net sales are expected to be approximately $5 billion, with significant margin growth, according to the statement.In acquiring Reckitt's food business, McCormick faced a large group of potential rivals. Bloomberg reported in May that the sale was expected to draw interest from Post Holdings (POST) and Conagra Brands (CAG). Other possible bidders included JM Smucker (SJM), Campbell Soup (CPB), Pinnacle Foods (PF) and Ajinomoto, people familiar with the situation said at the time.In addition to selling yellow mustard and hot sauce, the division makes ketchup, onion flavorings and other products. Hot sauce will continue to see robust growth, with opportunities for expansion, McCormick said. The company said it plans to expand the global presence of Frank's RedHot and French's products, whose sales are now concentrated in the U.S.McCormick dates to 1889, when founder Willoughby McCormick began selling flavors and extracts door to door. The company went after another U.K. business in 2016, when it considered buying Premier Foods. But the suitor walked away from takeover talks in April of that year, saying that Premier was demanding too high a price. McCormick's Kurzius said at the time that Premier was just one of the company's M&A ideas.Credit Suisse Group AG is serving as the financial adviser to McCormick on the RB Foods transaction, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is legal counsel. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial adviser to Reckitt and the company also received advice from Robey Warshaw.The deal is expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of McCormick's fiscal 2017, pending regulatory approvals. McCormick plans to fund the deal with a combination of equity and debt, and said it has obtained committed bridge financing.

Smucker (SJM), Toll Brothers (TOL) and Best Buy (BBY) are on tap, new-home sales from the Commerce Department are due, and Line Corp. (LN) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) could flash important stock signals.Estimates: Analysts see the installer of fiber optic wiring reporting a 69% jump in fiscal Q4 earnings to 61 cents per share. Revenue is seen rising 21.2% to $1.25 billion.Prior Quarter: In Q3, EPS jumped 86.2% to $1.80, on a 35% increase in revenue to $664.65 million.Stock: The Leaderboard name triggered sell signal on Aug. 11, falling below its 50-day line after Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google announced its fiber optic building ""pause."" But shares have risen for the past four sessions, climbing 3.8% on Monday to 91.30, back above the 50-day.Why It Matters: Web video is driving the need for faster internet speeds now forcing telecom customers to boost investment in fiber optic wiring.

32,SJM,"Stock indexes gripped solid gains Tuesday afternoon, but the rebound came in sharply declining volume.The Nasdaq rose 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running roughly 20% below average on the NYSE and about 25% off Monday's pace on the Nasdaq.The gains in lower volume Tuesday raised concerns about the rebound. Sharp drops like those seen Friday and Monday are rarely the end of the story, and a lower-volume pop can often be a head fake before another round of selling.While winners led losers by a 9-to-1 ratio in the IBD 50, the situation was too new to suggest the market was turning back to growth stocks. Recent chart action still appears to favor conservative stocks.Take a look at the weekly chart of AT&T (T). The blue chip is moving up in defiance of recent worries in Europe. AT&T is working on its sixth up week in a row.AT&T is up 22% year to date and is about 6% extended from a 39.82 buy point. For dividend investors, the annualized yield is 4.6%.J.M.

35,SJM,"When it comes to mature markets, it doesn’t get much more mature than breakfast cereal, which was first introduced in the U.S. during the Civil War.That kind of mileage makes it difficult for leading cereal makers such as Post Holdings (POST) -- which traces its history to 1895 -- to find growth through the kinds of disruptive, gee-whiz advances you’ll find in other sectors of the economy. There’s only so many flavors you can pull out of cereal grains after more than a century of trying, and only so many ways to package and market them.So Post has looked for growth via acquisitions into different product lines. Since being spun off by Ralcorp in February 2012, the company has made nine buyouts. You can expect Post to keep scouting deals in coming months.“We believe we are quite well positioned with the considerable amount of cash on hand approaching $900 million,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Zadoks said on the company's recent fiscal-first-quarter conference call with analysts. “We’ve got considerable secured debt capacity (and) a very rich pipeline of opportunities. I think we are going to have plenty of opportunities on the M&A front.”Acquisitions have helped Post grow its top line nearly 400% over the last four years — from $959 million in annual revenue in 2012 to $4.6 billion last year.Some have helped Post expand its traditional lineup of cereal brands. But the company also has moved into other product areas like pasta, protein bars, dried fruits, nuts, eggs, sports nutrition supplements and peanut butter. Among the company’s acquired brands: PowerBar, Attune Foods, Dakota Growers Pasta, American Blanching and Mom Brands.Post’s latest buyout came in October, when it spent $90 million to acquire Willamette Egg Farms, a producer, processor and wholesale distributor of eggs and egg products in the Northwest. The Willamette business is expected to add $80 million a year in net sales to Post and around $15 million a year in earnings before various adjustments, or EBITDA.Several different businesses fall under the Post corporate umbrella. The Post Foods business includes ready-to-eat cereal brands such as Grape Nuts, Post Raisin Bran and Pebbles. Mom Brands is geared more toward hot and value-priced cereals.Brands in the Michael Foods Group include Simply Potatoes hash browns, Dakota Growers pasta and All Whites liquid egg whites. The Active Nutrition segment features the PowerBar, Premier Nutrition and Dymatize Nutrition brands. Post also has a Private Brands group that includes Golden Boy peanut butter and nuts, as well as Attune Foods, which is heavy on organic and non-GMO granolas, cereals and snacks.Michael Foods is the biggest segment by sales, accounting for just less than half of the total. Post Foods contributes about one-third of sales, with the rest fairly evenly split between Active Nutrition and Private Brands. All of the segments saw declines in comparable sales during the first quarter.Post had a mixed performance during the quarter, which ended in December. The company logged adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share. That reversed a loss of $1.15 per share from the previous year and came in well above consensus estimates for 25 cents.But sales, which grew 16% to $1.25 billion, came in slightly below views. The gain was driven by Mom Brands, which Post acquired last year for about $1 billion. On a comparable basis that excludes the contribution of acquired brands, Post’s net sales declined 4.2% from the prior year.Still, the company’s share price hit a record high of 72.64 on March 3. The stock has also been helped by volatility in the broader market, which tends to push investors to the relative safety of the food business. In addition to Post, other food stocks that have set new highs in recent weeks include Tyson Foods (TSN), Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).“Underlying sales were negatively affected by the volume declines in the egg business, as well as the company’s transition in its Dymatize business to an outsourced production model following the closure of its manufacturing facility in the quarter,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe noted in a first-quarter earnings report.On the upside, Post’s EBITDA for the quarter came in at $236 million, ahead of estimates. Post also raised its fiscal 2016 EBITDA guidance to a range of $810 million to $840 million from prior guidance of $780 million to $820 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Post to log full-year earnings of $1.61 a share, up from 62 cents in fiscal 2015. Earnings are seen rising another 30% to $2.09 in fiscal 2017.“The company noted that this new guidance range incorporates incremental investments (approximately $25 million) related to incremental marketing spending and achieving synergies from the Mom Brands acquisition,” Growe said.During the first-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Robert Vitale mentioned a couple of macro trends that work in his company’s favor. One is low energy prices tied to cheap oil, which helps keep manufacturing costs down.Another is the company’s low exposure to volatile international markets. Post gets less than 10% of its sales from outside the U.S., and most of that comes from Canada.“While this domestic profile is a challenge in delivering volume growth, it also provides a safe haven from recent currency headwinds,” Vitale said.

38,SJM,"Eighty-year old companies that specialize in meat production aren’t usually looked upon as growth stocks, but Tyson Foods (TSN) aims to position itself as one anyway.The world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork plans to do so by putting more focus on branded products rather than commodities such as fresh poultry.Its ultimate goal? To become the ""leading branded protein company in the world,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report.""Tyson continues to position itself as a growth company with advantaged brands within advantaged categories,"" Palmer said.Those categories include high-margin, ""value-added"" products such as marinated and breaded poultry; prepared foods, including what it calls its “Core 9” packaged brands like Jimmy Dean sausage and Hillshire Farms lunch meat; and antibiotic and gluten-free chicken.During the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Tyson officials said 85% of the company’s chicken business consists of poultry that is more than just raw meat.""This further differentiates (Tyson) from its more commodity-oriented peers,"" Palmer noted.Tyson Chief Executive Donald Smith echoed that point on a fiscal first-quarter conference call with analysts.""I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy vs. grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure,"" Smith said. The ""buy vs. grow"" strategy refers to Tyson’s decision to purchase some of its chickens from other facilities and reduce the number of chickens it grows itself.Tyson officials have made no secret of their desire to change the way investors view the company. As JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman pointed out in a recent note, the first two words of Tyson’s presentation at the consumer group event were ""different company.""""Tyson remains firmly (and understandably) committed to convincing investors that it is a different company than it used to be,"" Goldman noted. ""The primary reason for the difference continues to be Tyson’s emphasis -- both in reality and perception -- on branded food rather than commodity protein.""One difference between branded food and commodity meat items is that the former carries higher prices and margins, Goldman says. Tyson’s Core 9 brands carry ""an 11% average premium over the category average.""Tyson also spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth during the consumer group event. That stood in contrast to other food companies, such as General Mills (GIS) and Nabisco parent Mondelez International (MDLZ), which mainly focused on cost-cutting.""These companies spent much, maybe most, of their time today talking about costs, whereas the opposite was true for Tyson,"" Goldman noted. ""It helps to have a category (meat/protein) growing at a better-than-average pace, as well as a category that responds well to mix- and margin-accretive innovation today.""There appears to be plenty of demand for Tyson’s meat products. Palmer cited Tyson research showing that 54% of U.S. consumers want to increase the amount of protein in their diets.Worldwide, long-term demand for protein is expected to increase more than 60% from current levels due to population growth and the emergence of a global middle class that can afford to buy more meat products.Favorable industry trends, combined with investor optimism over the food sector in general, have helped push Tyson’s stock price up more than 40% since Nov. 20. Its shares set a record high of 64.63 on Feb. 23 — the sixth straight session they reached a new high.Other large-cap food companies that have set new highs this month include Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).One reason for the recent stock gains is the defensive nature of the food business. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food. Companies in this industry aren’t as vulnerable to wide swings in performance and value and also tend to pay regular dividends. Some food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs.Meanwhile, Tyson has gotten a lift from falling food costs. Excessive supplies of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans have lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork. Lower costs were one reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month to a range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share from prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.65.The company also recently reiterated its goal of 10%-or-better annual earnings-per-share growth in coming years, and suggested that its long-term margin goals might be conservative.“We would not be surprised if before the fiscal year ended, Tyson raised its long-term chicken margin to maybe 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% currently,” Goldman noted.Tyson posted earnings of $1.15 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. That was up 49% from the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 89 cents. It was the biggest quarterly EPS gain in nearly two years.On the downside, revenue declined 15% to $9.15 billion -- the first dip since the September 2012 quarter -- partly because of the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. The top-line result fell short of consensus for $10 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tyson’s full-year earnings to climb 27% this fiscal year and another 7% in fiscal 2017.

40,SJM,"No, it ain’t fish eggs. Instead, ROE means return on equity -- or more accurately, return on shareholders' equity.The gauge divides a company’s full-year net income by its shareholders' equity, then multiplies by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD takes the average equity over the past two years. The result expresses how much profit it can generate for every dollar of net assets. IBD research into past big market winners shows a ratio of 17% or more as positive. Single-digit ratios could be cause for concern.ROE is a rough gauge for how efficiently management is putting capital to use and how its profitability is keeping pace with its growth as a publicly traded company.  As a company's equity grows, so does the challenge to maintain a high ROE. Earnings per share is another measure that weighs in on this question of ownership vs. profitability. But ROE does not take the number of shares into account.Where do you find it? Get a stock quote by using the search box at the top right corner of Investors.com. Under Stock/Company Data, you will find Annual ROE in the Company Fundamentals column. In addition, the minicharts presented with IBD’s Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and IBD 50 include ROE.Some companies often borrow debt to invest in new products and services to drive more profit. As a result, companies with high ROE sometimes also have somewhat elevated levels of debt.So as you perform your stock research, look at peer companies and compare their debt and ROE levels. If a target stock has a higher than group average ROE, and its debt is moderately higher, the two could be related.To be sure, a high ROE doesn’t compensate for unhealthy levels of debt. A long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 100% or more is considered high, even in certain industries known for heavy capital spending.If a stock has a low ROE (single digits and/or well below its group average) and very high debt, it could be a cause for concern.There is also a relationship between profit margins and return on equity. In some cases, you might allow for a below-peer ROE, if the company is churning out top-notch annual pretax margins. In general, annual pretax margin of 17% or higher is a sign of fundamental strength. You also want to see if a company's pretax margin is among the best in its industry.The average return on equity among current IBD 50 stocks is 28.4%. At the high end of the scale among companies that have thus far reported 2015 results, Campbell Soup (CPB) shows an unusually strong return on equity of 52.3%.That is well above peers like J.M. Smucker (SJM), with ROE of 7.2%, and even much larger players such as Kellogg (K), General Mills (GIS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC).Campbell’s pretax margins, 13.1% in fiscal 2015, are in line with these other food giants. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 185% is certainly on the high side. It helps boost Campbell's ROE above a company like Smucker, which shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 84%.

41,SJM,"Meat producer Tyson Foods (TSN) and food wholesaler Sysco (SYY) set record highs Friday as both stocks continue to benefit from favorable industry trends as well as the relative safety of the food segment in an otherwise rocky market.Tyson shares rose just a penny but still set a fresh closing high of 62.97 on the stock market today. It was the fourth straight session in which the supplier of beef, pork, chicken and other products established a new record.Sysco, which distributes food to restaurants, hospitals, schools and other customers, closed up 1.1% to a new high of 44.99 Friday. It was the fifth straight record session for Sysco.Tyson and Sysco join Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM) among large-cap food stocks that have set new highs this month.The entire sector has gotten a lift from the defensive nature of the food business, analysts say. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food, which are less susceptible to wide fluctuations and also tend to pay regular dividends.Food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs. This is especially important to companies like Sysco that move a lot of product from one place to another.Meanwhile, companies such as Tyson have gotten a lift from falling food costs. A large supply of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans has lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork -- a big reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month.IBD’s Wholesale-Foods group ranks at No. 3 out of 197 industry groups tracked. Food-Meat Products ranks at No. 4, while the Food-Packaged group ranks at No. 9.

In November, according to government figures, total revenue dropped nearly 20% to $3.94 billion.""We believe China policy settings are negatively affecting growth, specifically: (1) visa restrictions (on tourists from inland China to the Macau special administrative district), (2) the anticorruption drive, (3) a pullback in credit and (4) a soft housing market,"" wrote Wells Fargo's McKnight in a report Tuesday. ""We remain on the sidelines as uncertainty remains high.""In November, total ""mass"" market revenue — middle-class tourists — fell 13% vs. a year earlier in Macau, and the volume of junkets plunged 31%, McKnight said.So-called junket operators bring gamblers to Macau, especially affluent ""VIP""-category high rollers, often lending them money to get around local restrictions on how much cash can be brought into Macau.The Chinese government has cracked down on the lending practice as part of a broad ""anticorruption"" campaign, arresting several junket operators earlier this year on charges of money laundering.VIP revenue fell 24% for the month, McKnight said.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

157,SJM,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

158,SJM,"In a market where pet nutrition is rapidly picking pace, The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has struck the right chord with its latest move to acquire Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC. Additionally, the company revealed intentions to explore prudent choices for its U.S. baking category, which includes the possibility of a divestiture. Let’s take a closer look at these announcements and see what it means for the company.Ainsworth AcquisitionPer the terms of the deal, Smucker will acquire pet foods provider Ainsworth from L Catterton, a renowned private equity company, in a transaction worth approximately $1.9 billion. The amount includes estimated tax benefit of approximately $200 million. The company projects annual synergies of close to $55 million during the first three years. Also, post completion of the deal, the new business will add about $800 million in the first year. Subject to certain conditions, the transaction is expected to close during the fiscal year beginning on May 1, 2018.Pet Food Gaining TractionThe pet food category has lately delivered growth, courtesy of consumers’ becoming increasingly conscious about the health and wellness of their pets. In fact, the pet food and snacks category generate sales of more than $30 billion annually and counts amongst the fastest growing segments in the nation’s food and beverages market. The company’s effort to tap into this fast-growing arena, with the Ainsworth buyout, is expected to bolster its pet business. Additionally, the buyout will add the well-known Rachael Ray Nutrish brand to Smucker’s pet food portfolio. Incidentally, the Rachael Ray brand accounts for close to two-thirds of Ainsworth's sales. Apart from Smucker, General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been striving to expand in this category and entered into an agreement to acquire Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.  in February.Well, this is not the first time that J.M. Smucker has undertaken strategic efforts to strengthen its footing in pet foods. In 2015, it acquired Big Heart Pet Brand that added iconic brands such as Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. The buyout has been bolstering the company’s pet food business. Incidentally, net sales in the company’s U.S. Retail Pet Foods category inched up 2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, owing to improved volume/mix. These were primarily related to the Nature's Recipe brand and the company’s pet snacks portfolio. With the inclusion of Ainsworth, we expect Smucker to expand further in this category.Review of Baking BusinessJ.M. Smucker is also reviewing strategic options for its U.S. baking business, including a possible divestiture. The review process is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The company’s baking business encompasses renowned brands such as Pillsbury and Hungry Jack amongst others. The business, which falls under the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment, is expected to generate sales of approximately $370 million for the fiscal year ended in April, 2018. The review process forms part of the company’s restructuring efforts to focus more upon its pet products, coffee, snacks and other food items.  Wrapping it UpWell, the food industry has been grappling with stiff competition and shifting consumer preferences. Despite these headwinds, industry players like J.M. Smucker and United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report) are resorting to strategic tie-ups and other growth initiatives to thrive and sustain. J.M. Smucker actively pursues strategic acquisitions both in the United States as well as overseas. Further, the growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Moreover, cost-saving initiatives have enabled the company in undertaking investments.Indeed, such dedicated endeavors are likely to keep this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company as investors’ favorite.

160,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has decided not to proceed with the planned acquisition of Wesson oil brand from Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report) – deal that was announced back in May 2017. Both companies have mutually decided to call of the $285-million deal, following the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (""FTC"") administrative complaint against the planned acquisition (filed on Mar 5).The FTC was of the opinion that the inclusion of Wesson cooking oil in Smucker’s portfolio would lower competition and create Smucker’s monopoly in the canola and vegetable oils space in the United States. This is because Smucker already owns Crisco brand, which currently competes with Conagra’s Wesson oil brands. Notably, the neck-to-neck competition between these staple brands keeps prices of their products under check.However, had the deal materialized, Smucker would control at least 70% of the branded canola and vegetable oil sales to grocery stores and other retailers. Thus, the merger of Wesson oil brands and Crisco would clearly wipe out their existing competition — thereby giving Smucker a considerable edge to raise prices. Per the FTC, Smucker’s strengthened negotiating power would be a hindrance for retailers (traditional grocers in particular) and ultimately for customers who would have to bear the brunt of higher prices of branded canola and vegetable cooking oil.The Road Ahead for Smucker Post FTC AllegationWhile the FTC’s charges address the concerns of retailers and consumers, Smucker stated that it doesn’t agree with the FTC’s inference. Also, per Smucker, the FTC was unable to assess the contribution of private label brands in the oils space — which account for about half of the total cooking oil sales and hold solid market share at some retailers. Management further revealed that this deal was likely to generate noteworthy cost synergies — which would protect the competitive position of branded oil products.Incidentally, when the deal was announced, Smucker expected annual net sales of $230 million and additional adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share in the first full year of the closing of the buyout. The company also projected annual cost synergies of about $20 million within two years of the closing of the deal.However, despite being disheartened with the FTC’s conclusion, Smucker and Conagra decided to abort the plan. This is because both companies were not in favor of investing the considerable amount of time and resources it would need to counter FTC’s charges. Nevertheless, Smucker remains focused on enriching customers’ experience with its Crisco brand and oils business.Markedly, Smucker’s top line has been gaining from its focus on strategic partnerships, buyouts and improved performance of its brands. To this end, Smucker teamed up with quite a few coffee companies. Its agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products, has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. The company has been consistently extending partnership with KGM to augment K-Cup business opportunities.Further, the growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Notably, management stated that products launched over the past three years delivered net sales growth of nearly 7% during the third quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Driven by such factors, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 22.7% in the past six months, as against the industry’s dip of 0.8%.Looking for More?

161,SJM,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) regularly innovates to cater to changing consumer behavior. Products like Cookie Layer Crunch, Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels have significantly contributed to the company’s growth in 2017.Hershey has already launched Hershey's Gold in an instant consumable pack type. The company plans to launch take-home packages in the second quarter of 2018, which is likely to drive sales in the second half of the year. The same holds true for Reese's Outrageous. The company’s core chocolate brands — Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses — continue to drive growth. In 2017, the combined retail takeaway on these power brands increased about 5%. The momentum is expected to continue in 2018. Moreover, the company plans to improve the performance of select candy brands, which are likely to be positive contributors to marketplace performance in 2018.The acquisition of Amplify broadens participation in salty snacks, one of the fastest growing sub segments. The transaction is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018 and is expected to be accretive to Hershey's earnings in the first year following the closure. Overall for 2018, the company expects sales to increase 5-7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.94 billion, reflecting an improvement of 5.7% year over year.Apart from product innovation, let us delve into some of the key factors which are likely to affect the company’s performance in 2018.Marketing Initiatives to Increase VisibilityConsidering the sluggish sales performance, introducing innovative products is not enough. Packaging and marketing initiatives are also required to ensure strong customer outreach. The company is transitioning from lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on core chocolate candy products. These ensure that products get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improve shopping experience.While these packaging initiatives will adversely impact gross margin in 2018, the company believes that this is the right long-term investments which will improve shelf presence and visibility in 2018. Hershey has also made solid progress in key capabilities, such as multiyear ERP program and e-commerce.Cost-Saving Initiative to Offset ExpensesHigher freight and logistics cost hurt margins and are expected to be a headwind in 2018. Also, increased packaging costs and unfavorable mix are dampeners. Adjusted gross margin in 2018 is expected to be flat year over year. Nevertheless, Hershey’s productivity and cost-saving initiatives should offset higher costs. Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated in the range of $55-$65 million in 2018.China Business to Mar Sales VolumeThe implementation of Margin for Growth program in China is driving majority of the improvement. However, China SKU analysis and optimization efforts dented gross sales volume in 2017 and will continue to do so this year.Meanwhile, Hershey expects operating income to increase in North America and International as well as Other segments in 2018. Considering the planned capability investments — such as digital commerce — North America will not improve as much on a percentage basis as the International and Other segment.Bottom LineHershey’s strong U.S. marketplace presence and solid financial position provide the flexibility to invest in confectionery and other salty snacks as well as in the capabilities that lend the company a competitive edge over peers like The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report) and The Simply Good Foods Company (SMPL  -  Free Report).Product innovation, acquisition of Amplify and savings from Margin for Growth program are expected to boost earnings in 2018 despite higher expenses. The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.33-$5.43, reflecting a 12-14% increase from last year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $5.36, showing an improvement of 12.6% year over year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

162,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 16. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer food and beverage marketer and manufacturer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Notably, Smucker has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) Quote Hurdles in Smucker’s PathSmucker has been witnessing year-over-year decline in bottom line for three straight quarters now, with results being impacted by higher freight costs. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, management expects a rise in freight costs, stemming from industry-wide headwinds. In fact, higher freight costs are anticipated to continue to play a spoilsport in the next fiscal as well. Also, volatile input prices has been a concern for the coffee segment.Coffee prices are highly volatile and are affected by weather, pest infestation, political decisions in coffee-producing countries, worldwide supply and demand, the relative strength of the dollar and speculative trading. Green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time now, affecting the coffee segments profitability. During second-quarter 2018, profits from the U.S. Retail Coffee segment declined 18.2% due to higher costs of green coffee and unfavorable volume/mix impacts. The same also negatively impacted gross margin for said period. For the quarter under review, the consensus mark for sales and profit for the U.S. Retail Coffee stands at $541 million and $176 million, up from $538 million and $172 million reported in the same period last year, respectively.Apart from this, Smucker remains susceptible to fluctuation in the prices of input commodities such as oil, corn, wheat and soybean amongst others.Focus on Cost Savings & Strategic Partnerships to Fuel ResultsWhile these factors pose concerns for Smucker’s upcoming results, we remain encouraged by the company’s cost-saving efforts from its pet food synergy program. Notably, the company generated savings of roughly $200 million from this program in the last quarter, helping it witness higher profit at its U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. For the third quarter, the consensus estimate for sales and profit for this segment is pegged at $557 million and $125 million, compared with $551 million and $126 million, respectively.Apart from this, the company plans to achieve $100 million of its $250 million cost-management program by the end of fiscal 2018. Moreover, we remain hopeful about solid prospects from the company’s impressive brands portfolio. Evidently, favorable net pricing for peanut butter and Smucker’s brand largely drove the top line in the second quarter. Other than this, strong performance of several key brands fueled sales in all segments except U.S. Retail Consumer Foods. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $510 million, depicting a 1.4% dip from the year-ago figure. However, the consensus mark for profit at this segment is $123 million, representing a 3.4% upside from the year-ago profit.Final Thoughts & Q3 ExpectationsThough higher freight costs, industry headwinds and commodity cost inflation pose threats, Smucker’s focus on cost savings and efficient pricing across core segments should drive its performance in the third quarter. Also, Smucker’s concentration on innovations and alliances with companies such as Dunkin' Brands Group among many others should also yield results.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.16, which shows an upside of 8% from $2.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has trended upward by a notch in last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,888 million, up marginally by 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Smuckeris likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Encouragingly, Smucker carries a Zacks Rank #3, and possesses an Earnings ESP of +0.84%, which makes us reasonably confident of yet another positive surprise.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are other some companies that possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ollie's Bargain (OLLI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

163,SJM,"Treehouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this packaged foods and beverages manufacturer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Treehouse Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises, and has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Treehouse Foods, Inc. Quote Factors Weighing on Treehouse FoodsTreeHouse Foods has been witnessing year-over-year declines in both the top and bottom line for two successive quarters now. In the last quarter, the company put a dismal show, with results not only down year over year, but the bottom line also lagging the consensus mark and management’s guidance. Earnings were marred by drab sales and gross margin, while sales bore the brunt of the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business that lowered revenues by approximately 2.9%.Also, the company has been battling industry hurdles like consumers changing preferences that has led to heightened competition and waning store traffic for many food companies. These factors, combined with increased promotional activities create considerable pricing pressure, which remains a threat to TreeHouse Foods’ volumes and profit margins. Evidently, third-quarter results were hurt by challenges related to pricing in certain segments (Baked Goods, Beverages and Meals). Also, sales at the Snacks segment declined owing to adverse volume/mix arising out of weak consumer trends and exit of low margin co-pack business.Additionally, higher freight and commodity costs weighed upon the company’s EBITDA (particularly the Beverages and Snacks segments). Owing to the aforementioned hurdles, direct operating income (“DOI”) margin in these segments contracted 610 and 480 bps, respectively in the quarter. Also, management expects the division DOI to have a considerable drag on the bottom line in 2017. Moreover, commodity and freight costs are likely to remain high in 2018 as well.Can TreeHouse 2020 Initiative Provide Respite?TreeHouse Foods announced TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan in second-quarter 2017. The plan has been designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Along with cost savings, the initiative is expected to improve management of the company’s category and customer portfolio, as well as optimize its supply chain.  The plan will be carried out through a series of phases in the next few years. Notably, this initiative is expected to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsWhile the company remains on track with its TreeHouse 2020 plan, management believes that it needs to take additional steps to enhance its position. Also, management expects the aforementioned headwinds to linger, which compelled it to curtail its earnings outlook for 2017, which also makes us apprehensive about fourth-quarter results. Adjusted earnings for the year are expected in the band of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Additionally, management projected adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter in a range of 91 cents to $1.01 per share.Further, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 93 cents, which shows an 18.4% decline from $1.14 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,686 million, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows doesn’t conclude that TreeHouse Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

164,SJM,"On Jun 20, the European Union (EU) announced that starting Jun 22, import tariffs of 2.8 billion euros or more than $3.2 billion will be levied on a variety of American products. The “tit-for-tat” levies came into action after the United States slapped tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports from EU countries.Trump signed the tariff plan into law on Mar 8, levying charges on steel and aluminum imports from other countries. Trump’s metal tariffs initially exempted neighbors Canada and Mexico, and the EU. But, on Jun 1, when the United States levied metal tariffs on the EU, citing “national security,” the EU did not shy away from taking such ""rebalancing measures.”New Set of EU Tariffs Fan Trade War FearsOn Jun 20, the European Commission said that a tariff of at least $3.2 billion will be imposed on imports starting this Friday (Jun 22). Earlier in June, when the United States imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU, the economic bloc gave enough hints of strong retaliation to this action. In fact, Maroš Šefcovic, Vice-President of the European Commission reportedly called the U.S. tariff decision “unilateral and illegal.”After Wednesday’s decision to charge import tariffs of 25% on different U.S. goods, Cecilia Malmström, trade commissioner of the EU, said that the rules of global trade “cannot be violated without a reaction” from the EU. She added that the EU’s response to Trump administration import duties is “measured, proportionate and fully in line with WTO rules."" Malmström also said that if “U.S. removes its tariffs,” the EU will follow suit.According to Export.gov, an International Trade Administration initiative, the EU’s average tariff charged on American products is 3%. However, after Jun 22, an import tax of a whopping 25% will be charged on all these products. Additionally, the EU threatened to levy tariff of further 3.6 billion euros or around $4.2 billion “in three years' time” or before provided something positive comes up in the “WTO dispute settlement.”Stocks at the Receiving End of EU TariffsThe EU decided to levy tariffs on U.S. goods after President Trump threatened a fresh set of tariffs of $450 billion on goods imported from China. The ongoing trade war between the United States with China and now the EU is clearly a sign of worry for global trade.In fact, a wide variety of American product types, including agricultural products like bourbon whiskey and peanut butter, steel giants and jeans companies will be impacted by this new set of EU import tariffs. Bourbon whiskey companies like Elijah Craig and Blanton’s, and The J. M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), one of the key players in peanut butter industry will bear the trouble.Moreover, trade tensions between Washington and Brussels might be affecting motor-bike manufacturer, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report). European auto-giants like Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report), BMW BMWYY and Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) will also suffer as some of their biggest production plants are in the United States. Negotiations are underway to abolish auto tariffs between the United States and the EU.Other companies to be affected by the new EU tariffs are jeans company Levi Strauss and steel manufacturers, United States Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report). While United States Steel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Steel Dynamics holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing UpUndoubtedly, the EU tariff announcement has added to the already intensifying trade war. The EU is gearing up to levy import tariffs on a number of American goods including motorbikes, jeans, bourbon whiskey and peanut butter. The U.S.-China trade war and rising tariff-related tensions between the United States and the European Union are expected to dampen investor sentiment in the days to come.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

166,SJM,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell. We note that this cosmetics giant has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise for 14 and four consecutive quarters, respectively. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the company’s well-chalked buyouts, innovations, savings efforts, strong market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network.On the flip side, the company has been facing receding traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Moreover, the company’s gross margins have been strained for a while now, thanks to a mix of factors.On that note, let’s see if Estee Lauder’s growth can counter the aforementioned hurdles and aid it in maintaining its spectacular surprise streak alive this time.Acquisitions to Boost ResultsThis cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have been strengthening its fastest-growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Estee Lauder’s investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is likely to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods. The company’s previous moves in this regard include the buyout of By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW. Apart from skin care, Estee Lauder has also acquired high-end fragrance and lifestyle brands such as Le Labo (The Lab) and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Quote E-commerce & Travel Retail to Drive GrowthEstee Lauder has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years. The company has been constantly implementing digital experiences such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. Further, Estee Lauder is focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged a major sales driver for the company. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by the company’s continued investments in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, along with double-digit increases in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network. Well, the company is committed toward undertaking greater strategic efforts to enhance travel retail business.Forecasts Look BrightBuoyed by the aforementioned factors, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.02-$1.04 per share for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the previous projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for the said period is currently pegged higher at $1.07.Further analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management predicts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter. Foreign currency is expected to positively impact sales by 3%. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 9-10%.  Can Efforts Offset Hurdles?Persisting concerns surrounding lower sales in North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores has been a concern for Estee Lauder for quite some time. Also, the company is cautious about social, economic and political issues that could affect consumer spending in few countries. Further, the company has been struggling with gross margin declines for more than four quarters now.Nevertheless, we expect the company to overcome the impacts of such hurdles with the help of the aforementioned growth drivers. Moreover, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. All these upsides, along with expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keep management encouraged about continuing with its sturdy performance in the second half and fiscal 2018. Well investors’ too are optimistic regarding the stock, evident from its astounding 69.4% surge in the past year, while the industry rallied 35.1%.All said, lets now finally take a look at what the Zacks Model unveils regarding Estee Lauder’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Estee Lauder is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In fact, courtesy of these factors, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has managed to return 3.8% in the past six months, even when the industry was down 9.4%.   Though escalated costs remain a threat to margins, we expect the Church & Dwight’s strategic growth efforts to help offset these hurdles and fuel further growth at the company, which possesses a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.5%. On that note, let’s delve deeper into these catalysts.Focus on Acquisitions Strengthens PortfolioChurch & Dwight, which started with only one brand (ARM & HAMMER) has acquired a number of premium brands over time. These businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004, which is expected to reach $4 billion in 2018. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter and is  on track with its integration. The company's other recent acquisitions include Agro BioSciences in May 2017 and VIVISCAL business in January 2017. Prior to that, the acquisitions of ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands from Johnson & Johnson in December 2016 helped the company boost its business internationally.International Consumer Business: A Major Growth AvenueThe company’s international consumer business has been consistently contributing to organic sales growth of the company. In fourth-quarter 2017, organic sales in the international segment jumped 5.8% courtesy of higher volumes. Further, overall international sales surged 33.3%, receiving considerable impetus from STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets. Notably, the international consumer business has been a growth driver over the past few years and exceeded expectations with 11.8%, 7.4% and 6.2% organic growth in the first, second and third-quarter 2017, respectively. In fact, the international business grew 8% in 2015, 10% in 2016 and 18.3% in 2017.The company is also opening new offices in order to support increase in export business and expects this business to remain strong. Further, it is making considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China, which is likely to be a major growth driver in future. This is well-evident from the company’s recent tie-up with DKSH, to make the latter Church & Diwght’s leading distributor in Southeast Asia. The company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth.Organic Sales Trend Bodes WellChurch & Dwight has been witnessing organic sales growth for quite some time now, backed by its solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in the first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter, organic sales growth came ahead of the company’s guidance of 2.5% and was driven by higher volumes and better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. Organic sales rose 2.7%, 5.8% and 5.1% in the Consumer Domestic, International and Specialty Products segments, respectively. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow 3%, which is also its evergreen annual growth target.Q4 Retains Earnings Surprise Trend, View Looks EncouragingBuoyed by these factors, Church & Dwight marked its fifth consecutive positive earnings surprise, when it came out with fourth-quarter 2018 – wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year. Further, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs are expected to keep driving its performance. Also, management remains impressed with the broad-based growth and expects gains from tax reforms to benefit the bottom line. The effective tax rate in 2018 is expected to be about 24-25% compared with 32% in 2017. Consequently, the company estimates earnings per share of $2.24-$2.28, reflecting 16-18% growth in 2018.Shareholder-Friendly Moves Instill OptimismApart from this, the consumer goods behemoth has a consistent track record of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases. In fact, management recently raised its quarterly dividend by 14%, which marked the company’s 22nd straight year of dividend increase. Notably, the company has regularly paid dividend for 117 years. Also, in the last quarter management authorized a new buyback plan of shares up to $500 million.Clearly, these factors reflect Church & Dwight’s robust ongoing prospects, which should drive further cheerfulness among investors.Looking for More Promising Bets?

168,SJM,"The U.S. equity market is in jitters as possibilities of a trade war with China and three or more rate hikes by the Federal Reserve do the rounds.When the market is turbulent, the consumer staples sector can be one of the safest go-to places for investors. Predominant as an abode of defensive stocks, this space primarily includes companies that offer products and essentials used in daily lives.However, China’s aggressive stance of slapping 25% tariffs over American imports on Apr 1 has affected the U.S. agricultural, meat products, as well as farm equipment companies, congregated under the consumer staples sector.Nevertheless, the operative date for the imposition of these tariffs has not been disclosed yet.Per our latest Earnings Preview (Apr 6, 2018), the first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues of consumer staples stocks in the S&P 500 group will likely climb 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively, year over year.Among the numerous potential gainers within the sector, adding Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio will bear fruit.Over the last month, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 4.9%, as against the 2.2% loss incurred by the industry. Reasons for the Bullish RunRevenue Growth: Consumers’ loyalty toward popular brands, such as Skippy, Spam, Hormel Black Label bacon, Muscle Milk and Wholly Guacamole dips, is anticipated to bolster Hormel’s revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, the new deli division in the company’s Refrigerated Foods segment will help drive its top-line performance. The company estimates that this division currently possesses a capacity to generate nearly $1-billion annual sales and will act as its next growth engine in the near future.Additionally, Hormel believes the company’s ongoing marketing programs (like ‘BE SMOOTH LIKE SKIPPY’) will continue to strengthen its revenues in the quarters ahead.During the first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release (Feb 22), Hormel reaffirmed its sales guidance for fiscal 2018 (ending October 2018) in the $9.7-$10.1 billion range.As per our in-house projections, Hormel’s revenues are projected to be up 5.8% for fiscal 2018 and 3.1% for fiscal 2019 (ending October 2019).Earnings Growth: Hormel has been steadily improving its profitability on the back of higher revenues and increased operational excellence. In addition, the company believes reduced corporate tax rates (on account of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implementation in December 2017) will aid in driving its bottom-line growth.During the fiscal first-quarter earnings release, Hormel raised its earnings per share (EPS) view for fiscal 2018 to the $1.81-$1.95 per share range, higher than the prior guidance of $1.62-$1.72 per share.Acquisitions Story: Hormel intends to strengthen its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. Well-planned buyouts like CytoSport Holdings, Inc. (August 2014), Justin’s, LLC (June 2016), Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc. (August 2017), Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol. (August 2017) and ColumbusManufacturing, Inc. (November 2017) will likely continue to boost the company’s revenues and earnings in the near term.Upward Estimate Revisions: Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hormel’s earnings has moved up 2.4% to $1.72 for fiscal 2018 and 6.3% to $1.87 for fiscal 2019. The positive earnings estimate revisions indicate upbeat market sentiment and substantiate the Zacks Rank #2 for the stock.Notably, Hormel’s earnings will likely grow 9.6% for fiscal 2018 and 8.4% for fiscal 2019. Furthermore, the company’s EPS is predicted to rise 9.3% over the next three to five years.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are listed below:The J.

169,SJM,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been scaling up the charts, with its shares rallying 17.7% over a year, versus the industry’s slump of 13.2%. We note that Sysco’s U.S. Foodservice Operations has been performing quite well of late, courtesy of its strategic growth efforts.   Notably, sales at this segment grew 6.6% and 3.9% year over year in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. During the second quarter, segment sales advanced to $9,681.2 million as restaurant sales continued to grow — which compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Markedly, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters.Sysco’s U.S. Foodservice business has been gaining from the company’s solid brand strength across the nation, thanks to the impressive product assortment; constant focus on brand revitalization and innovations. In this regard, Sysco has been benefiting from its efforts to offer on-trend products as well as the success of its e-commerce platform. In fact, the result of these initiatives is evident from the fact that Sysco’s local customers contributed about 46% to the total cases bought, marking 37 bps growth from the year-ago period.Although the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been incurring high operating and selling expenses that can weigh on margins, a chunk of these expenses is allocated toward investments for business growth. Incidentally, Sysco recently announced the takeover of Doerle Food Services (a Louisiana-based food service distributor), in a drive to widen its U.S. distribution network. This buyout is expected to strengthen Sysco’s core business and maximize customers’ value. Investments like these and effecting marketing, along with productivity gains are likely to continue fuel the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment.What Else Keeps Sysco Well Placed for Growth?Apart from strength in the U.S. Foodservice Operations unit, Sysco has been riding on its focus on its key growth strategies announced last year. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. Driven by these strategies, Sysco expects gross profit to rise in a band of 55% to 65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25% by 2020. Earnings per share is envisioned to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020.Also, the company’s solid balance sheet and free cash flow augmenting ability will help it make business investments, continue with merger and acquisitions, make share buybacks, repay debt and attain a preferred dividend payout ratio of 50-60% over time. Talking of acquisitions, the company has been carrying out various buyouts over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In fact, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance its presence in international markets and its product portfolio.All said, management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver another solid year.Looking for More Promising Bets?

171,SJM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company posted a negative earnings surprise of 18.2% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, it has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Consequently, the company has reported average negative surprise of 4.1% in the trailing four quarters.Additionally, the company has posted negative earnings surprise in eight of the last 10 quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 70 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of about 6.7%. Further, we note that earnings estimate for the quarter has declined by 1 cent in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16.4 billion, down 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company has a negative sales surprise history having lagged estimates for over three years now. This led Archer Daniels to underperform the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past year. The company’s shares dipped 2.6%, while the sector ascended 12.8%. The company’s dismal top-line performance makes us slightly skeptical about its upcoming results.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has a dismal sales surprise trend due to lower sales at all segments. This drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins. In the most recent third-quarter 2017, earnings were hurt by a tough operating environment at the company’s Agricultural services and Oilseeds Processing segments, while sales declined across all segments.Additionally, the company’s margins remain under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Agricultural Services and Oilseeds Processing segments. Margins at Agricultural Services segment were hurt by soft merchandising and handling results for North America Grain due to lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Further, lower crushing margins as well as lower South American origination margins resulted in reduced margins at Oilseeds Processing segment. Based on the dismal third-quarter performance and negative surprise trend, we remain apprehensive about the company’s future performance.However, Archer Daniels remains committed to strengthening capacities and geographic spread, through buyouts and other organic expansions. These factors and the prospects from Project Readiness, position it to deliver solid bottom-line growth in 2017. Moreover, the company’s transition from a period of costs and investments in acquisitions, new innovation centers and facilities, to focusing on reducing capital spending and increasing benefits from investments, is likely to aid results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

172,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its effective brand strengthening and cost management efforts. Additionally, the company has been focusing on innovations and undertaking strategic acquisitions to bolster market share. However, persistent rise in freight expenses has been hurting the company’s margins, raising concerns for management. That said, let’s take a closer look at the aspects impacting Smucker’s performance.Strategies to Strengthen Brand PortfolioThe food industry is rife with competition and shifting consumer preferences. Amid this scenario, companies like Smucker and United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report) often resort to strategic tie-ups to augment their offerings and stay afloat. Smucker actively pursues strategic acquisitions in the United States as well as overseas. Its agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Additionally, the company has formed key partnerships with coffee companies like Rowland Coffee along with other food brands such as Sahale Snacks and Enray Inc. amongst others.Speaking of acquisitions, Smucker has been expanding in the pet foods category. Consumers’ rising consciousness regarding the health and wellness of pets has been giving much impetus to companies to grow in this category. Recently, the company concluded the acquisition of Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC., a renowned name in the premium pet foods segment with popular brands like Rachael Ray Nutrish, Well, this is not the first time that Smucker has undertaken strategic efforts to strengthen its footing in pet foods. In 2015, it acquired Big Heart Pet Brand that added iconic brands such as Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. Apart from Smucker, General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has also been striving to expand in this category and recently concluded the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. In fact, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is also planning to foray in this category, evident from its recent launch of the Wag brand.Apart from these, the company focuses on brand building through product innovation. The company’s recent launches include Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee and Meow Mix Servings cat food. These introductions contributed significantly toward sales growth during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In fact, management stated that products launched over the past three years delivered net sales growth of nearly 7% during the third quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Well, Smucker’s dedicated efforts to augment brand strength are reflected in third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. In the said period, Smucker witnessed growth across most core brands and categories. Going ahead, we expect that the company’s continued focus on brand building will add more colors to its performance. Hurdles yet to be CrossedSmucker continues to bear the brunt of higher freight expenses, which hurt its margins in the third quarter. In fact, management stated that the freight costs were greater than anticipated, thanks to a difficult transportation landscape in the United States. The company expects these headwinds to linger in the fourth quarter, which along with charges related to inventory obsolescence compelled it to lower gross margin view.  Additionally, lower net price realization dampened Smucker’s performance in several segments during the third quarter. Such persistent hurdles are a threat to Smucker’s performance. Well, such deterrents have dragged the company’s shares by almost 13.2% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s decline of 9.2%.Nevertheless, the company has put into place stringent cost saving measures, which is expected to aid savings worth $100 million in fiscal 2018, which forms part of its targeted savings of $250 million for 2020. Also, we are encouraged by Smucker’s efforts to boost the top line through brand development. We hope that such endeavors will uplift investors’ optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in the forthcoming periods.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

174,SJM,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 9, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this leading beauty company will be able to pull a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 33.3%. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 3.1%.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Strategic Buyouts & Initiatives to Drive Coty in Q3Coty has been gaining from its focus on strategic buyouts, product launches and brand licenses to enhance the portfolio. The buyouts have been enhancing its portfolio, which is augmenting its top line. Notably, the company’s top line jumped 14.8% year over year in the last reported quarter, driven by contributions from ghd, Younique and Burberry. Additionally, revenues gained from robust growth in Luxury, and continued strength witnessed in the Professional segment.The company remains optimistic about the ongoing synergies from buyouts, which have been solidifying its portfolio. Also, innovations and e-commerce operations are driving results. Given these factors and the year-to-date performance, the company expects modest net revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Management also expects healthy margin improvement over the second half, with maximum contributions from the fiscal fourth quarter.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.19 billion reflects growth of 7.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Further, Coty holds a strong position in fragrances and color cosmetics, and has a solid regional presence in the skin & body care. Also, management keeps introducing new products in response to shifting consumer preferences, and market new and established products through strategic advertising and merchandising.Additionally, Coty is boosting its end-to-end digital-transformation efforts, including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. In the fiscal second quarter, Coty launched artificial-intelligence tools on boots.com in the UK and it also partnered with Amazon to launch “Let’s Get Ready” for the Amazon Echo Show. Apart from this, the buyout of leading online peer-to-peer social-selling platform, Younique, is a major evidence of Coty’s focus on connecting with customers through e-commerce initiatives.Possible Deterrents That Might Impact the QuarterHowever, Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment has been sluggish for the past few quarters. It has been struggling due to underlying challenges in North America, changing consumers’ preferences and a competitive environment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment dipped 1.3% in the fiscal second quarter on account of persistent softness in the global mass beauty market. Though the company is working toward improving the segment, the recovery is likely to take time. This remains a concern for Coty’s upcoming performance.Consequently, the stock has declined 12.3% in the past month, wider than the industry’s fall of 8.9%. This reflects a negative sentiment on the stock, ahead of the earnings release.Analysts polled by Zacks expect earnings of 12 cents per share for the to-be-reported quarter. Though consensus estimates have been stable in past 30 days, it reflects a decline of 20% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Coty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

175,SJM,"Delta Apparel, Inc. (DLA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. The manufacturer of comfort fabric apparel has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters. However, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter. Let’s see what’s in store for Delta Apparel this time around.What to ExpectThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 27 cents, which shows a 42.6% slump from 47 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $100 million, down 3.8% from the year-ago period reported figure. Delta Apparel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Apparel, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Apparel, Inc. Quote Factors Driving the QuarterDelta Apparel is likely to gain from its robust endeavors aimed at rationalizing business, enhancing operational efficacies and implementing marketing initiatives. These strategies, along with solid consumer demand helped the company deliver strong results in the last reported quarter. Further, management remains encouraged about expansion plans of Art Gun, Salt Life as well as Soffe. Art Gun’s focus on solidifying geographic reach, Salt Life’s strength across retail stores and e-commerce, and Soffe’s efforts to curtail costs and improve performance are likely to fuel Delta Apparel’s performance. All these factors bode well for the quarter to be reported.However, we remain cautious about the tough retail environment, that may weigh on sales and margins. Further, the company divested its Junkfood business toward the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which may hurt year-over-year comparisons this time. Apart from this, we remain apprehensive about higher raw material costs that weighed on the company’s gross margin in the last reported quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Delta Apparel is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

176,SJM,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because J. M. Smucker is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SJM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.91 per share for SJM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SJM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.62% heading into earnings season.J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

177,SJM,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 21. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this convenience foods behemoth will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. It delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter is pegged at 97 cents compared with $1 in the year-ago period. Estimates have been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $2.2 billion, down 1% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayCampbell Soup has been struggling to revive its top line, which hasn’t witnessed year-over-year growth for quite some time. Moreover, it has missed the Zacks consensus mark for three straight quarters now. Known for its canned foods, much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Nevertheless, the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division recovered slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, after it was marred by lingering constraints related to the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall in June 2016.These factors have also weighed upon the company’s shares that lost 21.9% so far this year, wider than the industry's decline of 9.5%.  Further, the company anticipates the operating environment to remain challenging in fiscal 2018, wherein it expects to witness cost inflation. The company’s earlier guidance indicates that the first-half results will remain significantly soft.Additionally, stiff competition in the food industry and rising commodity prices might dent the company’s performance in the near term.Nevertheless, Campbell Soup is on track with its four core plans including focus on real food philosophy and transparency, undertaking robust digital endeavors, portfolio diversification and concentrating on growing its snacks brands. Meanwhile, the company is progressing well with its cost savings plan, which evidently helped it achieve gross margin, EBIT and earnings growth in fiscal 2017.So let’s wait and see whether these obstacles are offset by the company’s robust brand portfolio, solid cost-savings and four core plans.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Campbell Soup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteWhile Campbell Soup has an Earnings ESP of +0.70%, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The J.

179,SJM,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) has been grappling with lower volumes, higher raw milk expenses and unimpressive surprise history. Also, the company posted lower-than-expected earnings and revenues in fourth-quarter 2017. Consequently, management issued a soft outlook for 2018.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company were down 14.1%, after it reported fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26. The stock has lost 25.4% year to date compared with the Consumer Staples sector’s decline of 5.9%. Moreover, the stock’s dismal run in the market is evident from its Momentum Score of F.Dean Foods has been struggling against challenges such as soft product volumes, higher raw milk costs and loss of share in U.S. fluid milk volumes, which has been largely impacting its top line. Apparently, the company has lagged sales estimates in four of the trailing five quarters, including the last quarter. Also, sales were down 4.1% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017, with total volumes across all products declining 6%.Moreover, the company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Therefore, any rise in the prices of these commodities might hurt margins. In the reported quarter, adjusted gross profit declined 9.9% while the adjusted operating income was down by 39.2%.For 2018, adjusted earnings per share are envisioned in the range of 55-80 cents versus 80 cents in 2017. Also, first-quarter 2018 earnings are expected to come disproportionately lower than fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents for the impending quarter and 64 cents for 2018 declined by 2 cents and 5 cents, respectively, in the last 30 days.Adding to the woes, the retail grocery industry experienced significant consolidation in recent years due to which competition has further intensified among dairy product suppliers. Dean Foods also faces stiff competition, both geographically and particularly at the processor level, in all major product lines that might weigh upon its overall profitability.Will Cost-Productivity Program Offset Hurdles?Dean Foods has been taking strategic measures to boost operational excellence via execution of the enterprise-wide cost productivity program to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond. This program mainly focuses on three major areas – enhancement of its supply-chain network, optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses.Notably, the company concluded the assessment phase and is in the advanced stages of designing and implementing its savings plans. Further, it has completed the initial phase of cutting down general and administrative expenses in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018. These initiatives together with the ongoing cost productivity efforts, are expected to generate savings in 2018, which are likely to offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non-dairy input costs. While some savings are expected to reflect in 2018, the company anticipates larger savings in 2019 and beyond.Under the OPEX 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017, the company targets annual savings of $80-$100 million. These savings are likely to offset input inflation and volume deleverage throughout its operational phase. Going forward, this plan will be extended to the company’s manufacturing and logistics footprint alongside targeting reduction in SG&A expenses. This multi-year plan, which is expected to span across 2018 and 2019, is likely to deliver incremental annual run rate savings of $150 million by 2020.All said, cost-saving efforts along with Dean Foods’ constant product innovations should place the company well for the long run. However, the recent dismal performance cannot be ignored.Want Top-Ranked Food Stocks? Count on TheseInvestors might consider some better-ranked stocks like The J. M.

180,SJM,"With divestitures and escalating input costs acting as dampeners, TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) has been in bad shape. Shares of this foods and beverage manufacturing company have declined 45% over the past six months, compared with the industry’s fall of 7.5%.Well, the food industry has been grappling with stiff competition and changing consumer preferences. Despite these headwinds, companies such as United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) and J. M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) have been able to thrive and expand, courtesy of their well-chalked growth initiatives and business tie-ups. However, TreeHouse Foods’ strategic efforts are yet to revive the company’s performance. That said, lets look closely at some of the headwinds plaguing this Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) company’s performance.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Divestitures & Weak Pricing TreeHouse Foods’ fourth-quarter 2017 results marked its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in earnings and sales. While earnings bore the brunt of soft sales and margins, revenues were mainly marred by divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business — which led to reduced sales at Baked Goods and Meals segments. Incidentally, the divestiture of the SIF business dented the company’s revenues during the third quarter. In fact, soft sales trends compelled the company to announce the closure of its pretzels and cereals manufacturing facility in Visalia. The move is likely to further dent the performance of the company’s Baked Goods segment.  Further, intense industry competition has led to unfavorable pricing impacts in most of the company’s segments. Moreover, volume/mix affected the Meals category.Input Cost Surge Dents Margins To add to the disappointments, TreeHouse Foods’ performance has been bruised by higher freight and commodity costs, dragging its direct operating income (DOI) margin. During the fourth quarter, division DOI margin contracted 270 basis points year over year. Management expects input cost inflation to remain a headwind in 2018, wherein freight costs are also expected to be a major hurdle.Rough Road Ahead Unfortunately, management anticipates the aforementioned headwinds to linger, which is evident from its dismal first-quarter fiscal 2018 outlook. Earnings for the first quarter are expected in the range of 10-20 cents per share, which reflects a year-over-year decline due to soft sales volumes, operational inefficiencies and the unfavorable timing of elevated commodity and freight costs with respect to pricing.Although TreeHouse foods has been stringently working toward business restructuring and reducing costs to better align its business with the changing industry landscape, such efforts are yet to offset persisting challenges.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

181,SJM,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. This provider of food and related products has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.1% in the trailing four quarters, with a beat in each quarter. Let’s see if Sysco can keep this positive streak alive this time around as well.Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote U.S. Food Service Unit & Strategy for 2020: Major DriversWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from strength at its U.S. Foodservice segment as well as its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions. These factors and solid cost-savings efforts helped the company retain its robust past record in the last reported quarter. Notably, Sysco’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its fourth straight quarter of sales beat, whereas earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight of the past nine straight quarters. Results in the quarter were mainly backed by strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, wherein restaurant sales continued to grow and compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters. Management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment.In the third quarter analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from U.S. Foodservice and International units to grow 5.7% and 8.3% to $9,761 million and $2,739 million, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall sales is pegged at $14,382 million, up from $13,524 million recorded in the year-ago period.Apart from this, we also remain encouraged about Sysco’s focus on its strategy for 2020, as it gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. This is evident from the recent launch of its redesigned website, which is aimed at enhancing consumers overall experience. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency. Further, we commend Sysco’s focus on acquisitions, which are expected to drive sales and also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Will Cost Hurdles be Offset?However, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin for the past two quarters. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company continued to bear the brunt of higher inbound freight costs, which stemmed from driver availability challenges in the industry. Segment-wise, the U.S. Broadline unit gross margin was marred by food cost inflation of 3.3%, owing to categories like meat, dairy and produce. The International segment was hurt by food cost inflation in the U.K., driven by higher product costs and currency movements.Also, the company incurred higher costs in Europe due to constant investments in transformation endeavors. Moreover, weakness in pound sterling resulted in acute food cost inflation in the United Kingdom, thereby hurting volumes and margins. Further, adjusted operating income for the International segment tanked 28.8% to $79 million. Persistence of these hurdles remains a threat to Sysco’s International performance.Nevertheless, we expect Sysco’s robust cost-saving initiatives and other growth endeavors to help offset these hurdles in the to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel the bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver a solid third quarter. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 64 cents, which marks a solid 25.5% improvement from 51 cents recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Sysco has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

183,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company’s (SJM  -  Free Report) long-awaited plans to divest U.S. baking business have finally taken shape. In yesterday’s announcement, the company revealed that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell baking business to Brynwood Partner in a transaction worth $375 million. Management believes that the decision aligns well with its strategy to concentrate on other prospective business areas, namely coffee, pet foods and snacking.Impacts of the DivestitureThe divestiture is expected to be completed by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2019 and is subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The deal will exclude certain renowned brands such as Pillsbury, Hungry Jack, Martha White, White Lily and Jim Dandy along with relevant licensing agreements and trademarks from Smucker’s portfolio. Additionally, Smucker will forego the manufacturing facility located in Toledo, OH. Apart from this, the transaction is likely to curtail Smucker’s fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings by almost 25-30 cents per share. However, the downtrend seems dilutive when gains from the divestiture are taken into consideration.Incidentally, the baking category has been sluggish and hampering the performance of the broader U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. Considering this, the company’s decision to divest the unit is justified.Bolstering Other BusinessesBy selling underperforming businesses, Smucker expects to make better use of its resources through investment in other potential categories. Well, the company identifies robust opportunities in its pet products, coffee as well as snacks businesses and intends to concentrate more on these areas. Recently, the company concluded the acquisition of Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC., a renowned name in the premium pet foods segment with popular brands like Rachael Ray Nutrish. This is not the first time that Smucker has undertaken such efforts to strengthen its footing in pet foods. In 2015, the company acquired Big Heart Pet Brand that added iconic brands such as Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. Moving on, the company has formed key partnerships with coffee companies like Rowland Coffee, Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc., along with other food brands such as Sahale Snacks and Enray Inc. among others.Final ThoughtsSmucker’s performance has been unimpressive of late, thanks to lower net price realization across certain segments and higher freight expenses. Such factors have dampened investors’ in this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock that fell almost 10.3% in the past three months against the industry’s rise of 5.2%. Nevertheless, we hope that Smucker’s efforts will boost overall business in the long run and revive the stock’s lost sheen.Smucker Fails to Impress?

184,SJM,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

185,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16, before the opening bell.The company’s coffee, consumer foods and pet foods businesses are likely to face challenges owing to unfavorable market conditions. However, the company expects positive yields from the partnership with Dunkin' Brands as well as its cost-reduction efforts.We note that Smucker has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.9% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s look into some of the aspects that are likely to impact Smucker’s second-quarter results.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has inched up by a cent in the past 30 days to $1.89. However estimated earnings depict a 7.8% decline from $2.05 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,895 million, down 1% from the prior-year sales of $1,914 million.J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) QuoteFactors at Play Smucker’s coffee segment has been performing disappointingly, owing to price rise and unfavorable volume/mix. Management expects headwinds in the coffee market to persist in fiscal 2018. As a result, the consensus mark for second-quarter sales of the U.S. Retail Coffee unit is at $532 million, depicting a 3.6% decline from the prior-year quarter.Further, the company’s U.S. Retail Consumer Foods business segment is expected to face challenges from stiff competition and unfavorable volume/mix. The consensus estimate for sales for this segment is pegged at $547 million, reflecting a 1.8% dip year over year. We note that sales from Smucker’s U.S Retail Pet Food business were flat in the prior quarter, owing to adverse impacts from rising competition and shift in consumer preference toward protein-rich products. These hurdles are likely to continue in the second quarter. Accordingly, the consensus mark for sales at the pet foods segment is $532 million, which represents a marginal 0.2% rise from the year-ago figure.Nevertheless, Smucker is hopeful about its strategic partnership with companies such as Dunkin' Brands Group. This is likely to drive the company’s performance in the second quarter. Moreover, the company’s cost-reduction initiatives and innovation-related efforts have been encouraging and are expected to yield favorable results. While these endeavors bode well for the company’s quarterly results, the aforementioned factors pose concerns. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Smucker is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Smucker has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #3 that make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.70% and a Zacks Rank #1.

186,SJM,"With a major chunk of the earnings releases behind us, the quarter seems to have fared quite well so far. While the number of overall positive surprises has been greater than previous periods, the revenue picture has been particularly impressive – in regard to both year-over-year growth as well as beat percentage.Though several sectors are nearing the last leg of their reporting cycle, we are yet to see results from quite a few food stocks that form part of the Consumer Staples sector that is currently placed among the bottom 38% out of all Zacks sectors. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 3.3% on a 1.5% rise in revenues.How is the Food Space Placed?The food Industry has been grappling with several issues of late, including stiff competition, sluggish traffic and an intense promotional environment stemming from consumers’ changing preferences. Moreover, the food space is battling soft volumes and inflated input prices. Back-to-back hurricanes also had a detrimental impact on food stocks with operations spread in the affected regions.While these factors make us jittery about the performance of food stocks in the quarter to be reported, we expect the companies to keep gaining from their focus on acquisitions, packaging methods and innovations, which have long been their growth drivers. Evidently, benefits from buyouts fueled top and bottom lines of Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) and SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) in their recently reported results. Also, food companies have been undertaking efforts to expand in the fast-growing organic goods space to resonate with the changing consumer demand. These factors, along with stringent cost-saving initiatives should cushion the food stocks from industry headwinds.Another factor that works in favor of food stocks is that they are relatively less vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, though they’re sure to step up during economic recovery when higher disposable income increases the demand for food. That said, we also remain encouraged about food stocks’ performance, given the favorable economic indicators like improving employment scenario and higher consumer confidence. Incidentally, Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years in this October.How to Pick Prospective WinnersAmid these mixed signals, we used the Zacks methodology and identified food stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this earnings season. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That said, investors can count on these stocks which are most likely to top estimates.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), which is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 13, is a solid bet. The company’s Earnings ESP of +1.28% and Zacks Rank #2 make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise. We expect the company to continue gaining from rise in demand at the beef and chicken segments. Rising preference for protein rich brands in the prepared foods category is also expected to favor Tyson Foods’ performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.37.Another stock worth considering is The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), which has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #3. This consumer food and beverage products, and pet food and snacks manufacturer is scheduled to post second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16. J.M. Smucker’s consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.89. Notably, the company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.We also suggest investing in Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), which is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 28. This manufacturer and distributor of frozen foods has an Earnings ESP of +8.70%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at 23 cents. Further, the company, which has delivered back-to-back positive earnings surprises in the past two quarters, sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Another viable option is Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.52%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 39 cents. The company, which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3%, is slated to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21.Investors can also place bets on United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), which is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results next month.  This leading distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products has an impressive earnings surprise history, and a long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. Notably, United Natural Foods’ Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +6.33% indicate that the company is likely to maintain its solid surprise trend. We expect the company’s diversified portfolio and synergies from acquisitions to aid the beat. The current consensus estimate for the quarter is pegged at 59 cents.Well, these five stocks are not the only ones to bet on. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener and some permutation and combination, you can also discover other consumer staples stocks that have the potential to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

187,SJM,"The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer of food products, has been in troubled waters of late, due to unfavorable volume/mix, in its coffee segment. The food company also posted disappointing first-quarter fiscal 2018 results and slashed earnings guidance for the fiscal year.Dismal First-Quarter ResultsSmucker posted dismal first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 24 wherein both the top and bottom lines lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings nosedived 19% year over year due to planned increases in commodity costs and higher marketing expense. Net sales in the quarter also declined 4% year over year on account of lower volume/mix.The quarter also marked the fifth straight quarter of sales decline in its coffee business. Moreover, the Pet Foods segment also did not generate significant growth owing to unfavorable cost to price relationship combined with high marketing expenses.Following the dismal results, the company lowered its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. It now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of $7.75-$7.95 per share, compared with $7.85-$8.05 expected earlier. Also, the company expects lower pricing in U.S. Retail Coffee to negatively impact profits in the remainder of fiscal 2018.Weak first-quarter results also pulled down shares of the company. We observed that the stock has not only underperformed the industry but also the broader consumer staple sector on a year-to-date basis. Over the period, the stock has decreased 16.5%, while the industry declined 7.9%. The broader Consumer Staples sector of which they are part of, grew 10.9% in the said time frame.Estimates DecliningThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as well as for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has been declining over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter declined 9.6%, 2.8% for fiscal 2018 and 3% for fiscal 2019, respectively.J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) QuoteCurrency Headwinds and Sluggish Pet Food SalesThe company is also bearing the brunt of unfavorable currency and weak pet food business. Heightened competitive activity from more-premium brands and challenges in dry dog food against a deflationary macro environment is impacting the performance of the Kibbles 'n Bits brand. Also, retailers are increasingly looking at pet snacks as a new category separate from regular food, and are focusing more on to it. The company continues to expect softness in Pet Food sales in the near term.Initiatives to Boost BusinessThough heightened competition in the pet food business in the near term remains a concern, we are impressed with strong organic sales growth, product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions. Within pet snacks, the change in pricing strategies to improve the competitive positioning of Kibbles 'n Bits in the mainstream dog food category is driving volumes and is expected to support further growth.In the long term, the company expects to remain on track with its cost-savings initiatives. The company anticipates to launch improved K-Cup products in the Coffee and snacking segments.Further, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in seven out of the past nine quarters, with in-line earnings in one quarter. A low beta of 0.62, a dividend yield of 2.90%, VGM score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6% also makes the stock attractive.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSmucker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked food stocks in the industry are Nomad Foods Ltd. (NOMD  -  Free Report), Ingredion, Inc. (INGR  -  Free Report) and The Chef’s Warehouse Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report).Nomad has a VGM Score of B and sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

190,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the company crushed its three-quarter long trend of posting year-over-year decline in earnings. In fact, both the top and bottom line improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, benefits from tax reforms encouraged management to raise its earnings outlook for fiscal 2018.  Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of $2.50 per share surged 25% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16. Notably, earnings included a nearly 35 cents benefit from tax reforms. J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) Quote Net sales in the quarter inched up 1% year over year to $1,903.3 million and also beat the consensus estimate of $1,888 million. Sales were fueled by growth across most core brands and categories. Further, favorable volume/mix (mainly in pet food and coffee segments) aided sales growth. However, this was somewhat negated by lower pricing at pet foods. Net sales received benefits of $5.8 million owing to favorable currency exchange.Adjusted gross profit climbed 1% to $731.5 million, whereas adjusted gross margin contracted 10 basis points to 38.4%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased 4.4% to $399.8 million, though the adjusted operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 21%.Segment PerformanceU.S.Retail Coffee Market: The company's largest segment, U.S. Retail Coffee Market, reported 2% growth in sales to $550.5 million. This was backed by favorable volume/mix, primarily attributable to Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods and the Cafe Bustelo brand. This was somewhat countered by lower net price realization at the Folgers brand.Segment profit jumped 6% to $182.1 million, due to improved volume/mix and lower input costs, somewhat negated by escalated marketing costs.  U.S.Retail Consumer Foods:  Sales in the segment dipped 1% in the quarter to $511.6 million. Higher net price realization was more than offset by unfavorable volume/mix — mainly led by Crisco and Pillsbury brands, partly compensated by Smucker brand gains.Segment profit increased 2% to $121.3 million as the impact of lower volume/mix was more than offset by higher pricing and operational efficiencies.U.S.Retail Pet Foods: Net sales increased 2% to $561.9 million in the quarter owing to improved volume/mix, primarily related to the Nature's Recipe brand and the company’s pet snacks portfolio. This was partly countered by lower net price realization. Segment profit tumbled 7% to $118 million owing to higher marketing expenses and charges associated with obsolete inventory.International and Away from Home: Effective May 1, 2017, the company's U.S. Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home.Net sales grew 2% from the prior-year quarter to $279.3 million, reflecting favorable volume/mix driven by the Jif and Smucker's brands and positive impacts of currency rates.  This was partly countered by lower net price realization. Segment profit surged 16% to reach $52.6 million thanks to favorable volume mix, positive currency impact and reduced marketing costs.FinancialsSmucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $186.2 million, long-term debt of $4,688.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $7,804 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to $469 million, and the company generated free cash flow of $388.7 million during the third quarter. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Smucker generated free cash flow of $693.3 million.Concurrently, management stated that it contributed an additional amount of $20 million to its employee pension plan and announced a one-time bonus of $1,000 to approximately 5,000 employees —  courtesy of benefits from tax reforms.Fiscal 2018 OutlookManagement remains pleased with its third quarter performance, wherein results gained from sales growth in core brands in all businesses; tax reforms and solid cost-management.Net sales for the fiscal 2018 is still anticipated to decline slightly or remain flat compared with the prior year.However, Smucker raised earnings and free cash flow outlook, mainly on the basis of gains from tax reforms, somewhat offset by an expected rise in freight expenses. Effective tax rate is now expected to be 28%, much lower than 32.5%-33% forecasted earlier.The company now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of $8.20-$8.30 per share, up from the previously guided range of $7.75-$7.90. The outlook doesn’t include any impact from the pending buyout of Wesson oil brand from Conagra Brands. Free cash flow is projected to be approximately $825 million, compared with $775 million expected earlier. Capital expenditures are still expected to be about $310 million in fiscal 2018.Smucker currently carries a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).

In fact, recently rounds were made that Walmart is planning to build an inhouse cloud computing offering — a card already played by Amazon before. Also, sources revealed that Walmart’s Sam’s Club is providing free shipping services to premium members. These moves clearly echo the company’s transformation ideals from Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart that bears the biggest testimony to its efforts to keep pace with consumers’ changing preferences.The big box retailer’s various buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems also reflect the same. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Bonobos, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster.Online Grocery: A Major Growth AvenueApart from this, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to its e-commerce sales in the third quarter. In fact, Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonate quite well with this strategy. Incidentally, the company has been testing same-day deliveries with Deliv for quite some time now, while it also acquired a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries.Banking on the aforementioned endeavors, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily owing to Walmart.com’s performance. Notably, this includes significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service, which has now expanded to over 1,100 locations and is expected to have 1,000 additions next year.Focus on International ExpansionApart from having a dominant store and online presence in the United States, Walmart is also gaining from its solid international operations. With operations spread in China, Mexico, Canada and UK, international forms Wal-Mart’s second-largest segment, in terms of revenues. Evidently, international sales constituted about 24% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2017. This segment has been recording year-over-year currency-neutral sales for more than a year now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart’s international sales remained strong with 10 out of 11 markets recording positive comparable store sales (comps). Notably, Mexico and China performed exceptionally well, while results in the UK also improved in the quarter. The departmental biggie remains committed toward achieving growth across all its markets, on the back of its fresh products; expansion of online grocery and private brands. That said, we remain encouraged about Wal-Mart’s International segment performance.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Quote Together, these factors have been fueling the supermarket biggie’s performance, helping it to put up a stellar show. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s both earnings and revenues improved year over year and beat the corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this marked Walmart’s ninth and 13th consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise and U.S. comps growth. Also, management stated that its food categories performed exceptionally well and recorded the highest comps in about six years.Strained Margins Raise ConcernsWhile Walmart’s online strategies have been driving business, costs associated with investments in e-commerce expansion and technological advancements; the mix impact from growing e-commerce operations and Walmart’s compelling pricing strategy have been weighing on its margins. Evidently, these factors caused the company’s gross margin to contract 11 bps and 29 bps in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively, and also raises concerns over the upcoming performance.Final Thoughts & Q4 Expectations in NumbersNevertheless, the company remains encouraged about its ongoing performance, as reflected in its raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 and favorable comps view for the fourth quarter. In the quarter to be reported, Walmart expects both U.S. comps (excluding fuel) and Sam’s Club comps (excluding fuel) to increase in a range of 1.5-2.0%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the quarter under review is pegged at $1.36, which shows a 4.6% rise from $1.30 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $135,013 million, up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for Walmart U.S. net sales is currently pegged at $86,250 million, representing a nearly 3% upside from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimates for Walmart International and Sam’s Club sales are pegged at $32,564 million and $15,298 million, depicting increases of 5% and 2.1%, respectively.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Walmart is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

193,SJM,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has been in good shape lately, with a flourishing organic food business and growing presence in the e-commerce space. Moreover, the company’s well-chalked strategic targets for 2018 are expected to add greater sheen to its expanding business. However, higher freight costs and labor expenses have been acting as roadblocks in its performance.That said, let’s closely inspect some of these factors impacting this renowned name in the natural and specialty food space.Focus on E-commerce & Other Growth Initiatives Bodes WellWith sophisticated distribution networks and fulfillment centers, United Natural’s growth in the e-commerce arena is quite remarkable. Buoyed by such efforts, the company’s e-commerce sales jumped 23% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, positively impacting the top line. Furthermore, United Natural remains committed to enhancing its presence in e-commerce space through investments in technology and infrastructure. In this regard, for the forthcoming quarters, management projects robust opportunities.Apart from bolstering omnichannel presence, United Natural has laid out key targets for 2018, some of which drove fiscal third-quarter results. These targets mainly include plans to enhance customer base, expand the company’s broadline distribution channel, improve gross margin and retain focus on mergers and buyouts.Speaking of buyouts, the company has been carrying out several acquisitions over the years to grow distribution network and customer base, and boost long-term growth. A few noteworthy buyouts of the company include Haddon House, Gourmet Guru and Nor-Cal Produce. Further, the company strives to develop effective sourcing processes and supply-chain networks to better align supplies with demand, thereby efficiently meeting consumer needs.The solid focus on growth initiatives along with robust consumer demand across all sales channels, has been favoring United Natural’s top- and bottom-line performances for a while. During the fiscal third quarter, both top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. This marked the fifth and third consecutive quarter of earnings and sales beat for the company, respectively. Encouragingly, management expects the stellar performance to continue and it has raised fiscal 2018 outlook accordingly. Can Efforts Offset Cost Related Hurdles?Despite the aforementioned upsides, all doesn’t appear bright for United Natural. The company has been grappling with dismal gross margin rates for three straight quarters now, thanks to an unfavorable shift in consumer mix. Higher inbound freight costs have also been weighing on gross margin for some time.Unfortunately, for the next two quarters, management expects higher freight costs to remain a hurdle. Apart from United Natural, other food companies such as Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report), TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) and J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) have also been grappling with rising freight expenses lately. To further worsen matters, United Natural has been incurring higher labor expenses across several distribution centers due to the higher-than-anticipated demand. In fact, owing to the high demand, the company’s fill-rates have been deteriorating continuously for the past few quarters.Notably, such downturns have eclipsed the company’s performance. In the past three months, the stock has declined 2.7% compared with the industry’s increase of 5.5%.Nonetheless, we remain hopeful that the company’s strategic goals for 2018, especially, its e-commerce expansion efforts and plans to broaden distribution networks, will continue bolstering its performance. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects consistent growth in demand for its better-for-you products.Marching ahead with such bold ambitions, we expect United Natural to easily combat the aforementioned hurdles and raise shareholders’ confidence in the stock.

194,SJM,"Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer and manufacturer of accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Fossil has outperformed bottom-line estimates in three out of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 23.04%. Let’s see what’s in store this time. Fossil Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fossil Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. Quote Factors Weighing on FossilFossil has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches for a long time now due to increased competition and rising demand for tech-savvy watches. Further, sales of leathers and jewelry have persistently been weak since past few quarters on account of soft demand. Well, these trends were clearly witnessed in the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, wherein jewelry and leather business sales fell 23% and 20% (on constant-currency basis) respectively, with declines across all three regions. Also, the company’s watch sales dropped 4% mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category. Well, these concerns have been leading to dismal results for Fossil for more than two years now, with both the top and bottom line falling year-over-year.Efforts to Resonate With Evolving Demand Bodes WellFossil has been taking significant efforts to keep pace with the rising demand for tech savvy watches, Notably, Wearables represented more than 10% of the company’s sales in the third quarter, which nearly doubled from the year-ago quarter and also marked a sequential improvement. As the wearable business is expected to grow by $36 billion by 2020, Fossil Group remains poised to enrich its wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line up in 2018. Powered by Android Wear, these new brands will strengthen Fossil’s current portfolio with premium brands like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors and Misfit. Given the favorable consumer response and impressive performance from some key brands, management believes that wearables can play a key role in turning Fossil Group’s performance around. Thus, it also plans to undertake incremental marketing spending for this category.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsWhile the company has considerably expanded the Connected business, efforts to clear excess inventory continues to pressurize margins. Evidently, Fossil has been witnessing lower gross margin for a year now, primarily due to soft retail margins stemming from increased promotions to drive sales (in stores and e-commerce) as well as higher mix of connected products. Management expects obstacles related to increased promotions and unfavorable mix to dent gross margin in the fourth quarter. Also, Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category, which along with margin pressure compelled it to lower its 2017 forecasts.Expectations in NumbersFor 2017, Fossil Group now expects net sales to decline in the range of 8.5-10.5% and envisions the bottom line to lie in a range of a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents. For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 3.5-11% and expects adjusted earnings in the range of 10-65 cents per share.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 39 cents, which shows a considerable decline from $1.36 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $890 million, down 7.2% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsNevertheless, our proven model shows that Fossil Group is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Notably, Fossil carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +8.42%.

195,SJM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) maintains its commitment to boost shareholders’ value through dividend payouts. Recently, management has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 2.9% to $1.07 per share from the previous payout of $1.04. The new dividend will be paid on Oct 12, to shareholders of record as on Sep 27, 2017, after the adjustment of ex-dividend date on Sep 26. This brings the company’s annualized dividend to $4.28 per share, representing an increase from the previous annualized rate of $4.16.Notably, this was the 10th straight year of dividend hike by Philip Morris since it officially became a public company in 2008, reflecting a total growth of 132.6% or a compound annual growth rate of 9.8%. The last dividend hike of 2% to $1.04 per share was announced in September 2016.Dividend hike is frequent among companies with a stable cash position and healthy cash flows. Therefore, we believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Basically, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it.Apart from Philip Morris, other consumer staple companies like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) and The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividends. Altria raised its quarterly dividend by 8.2% to 66 cents per share payable on Oct 10. Pinnacle Foods has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 14% to 32.50 cents per share that is payable on Oct 9. J. M. Smucker hiked its quarterly dividend by 4% to 78 cents per share, which was paid on Sep 1.A Look at Philip Morris’ PerformanceThis tobacco leader has been witnessing declining shipment volumes mainly owing to declining demand for cigarettes because of ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, and price rise to offset the effect of rising taxes. Moreover, consumers opting for e-cigarettes or reduced risk substitutes are denting cigarette volumes.Despite declining cigarette volumes, Philip Morris continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power. Further, the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke-free products called reduced risk products as customers are shifting away from tobacco products. In fact, Philip Morris remains focused on the growing e-cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products such as HeatSticks and iQOS products and expects these products to drive growth in 2017.Also, the company’s consistent returns to shareholders in the form of dividends remain noteworthy.Shares of Philip Morris have gained 27.7% year to date, comfortably outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.7%.

196,SJM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, J. M. Smucker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, J. M. Smucker’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that J. M. Smucker has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 15.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for J. M. Smucker stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, J. M. Smucker has a P/S ratio of about 1.8. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, SJM is towards the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, J. M. Smucker currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes J. M. Smucker a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.6, which is better than the industry average of 13.3. Clearly, SJM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though J. M. Smucker might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A. This gives SJM a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current fiscal quarter as well as the fiscal full year has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 1% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and Consensus  J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and Consensus | J.M. Smucker Company (The) QuoteEven though J. M. Smucker has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineJ. M. Smucker is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 44%) should boost investor confidence.However over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in J. M. Smucker.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

197,SJM,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this apparel manufacturer and designer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Hanesbrands has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote International Strength & Focus on Buyouts Remain DriversHanesbrands has been delivering top and bottom-line growth annually for more than a year now. Hanesbrands has mainly been gaining from its focus on buyouts and strength in its international division. These factors also fueled the company in third-quarter 2017, wherein Hanesbrands organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. This, in turn was backed by solid International sales that represented nearly 31% of the company’s top line.International sales were fueled by strength in Hanes Europe Innerwear; Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, with global Champion sales growing 16% in the quarter. Notably, sales at the International segment jumped 14% on a currency neutral basis. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Management expects the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth. Also, we expect the International segment to continue being a major driver in the fourth quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for International sales is pegged at $551 million, representing a 9.1% rise from the year-ago period.While these factors are likely to drive the top line, focus on Project Booster program should help the company generate cost savings and aid the bottom line. Notably, by 2019, this project is anticipated to produce nearly $150 million of annualized cost savings, out of which roughly $50 million will be reinvested in targeted growth avenues.Factors Raising ConcernsHowever, a tough retail landscape has been hurting Hanesbrands’ brick-and-mortar performance. Evidently, this marred Hanesbrands’ domestic sales in the quarter. Further, the company’s Innerwear segment has been delivering soft results for a while now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In third-quarter 2017, sales at this unit declined 5.2% in the quarter to $644.1 million, as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape.Management expects the soft retail U.S. trends to linger in 2017, which raises concerns over its fourth-quarter performance. Incidentally, for the fourth quarter, the consensus mark for Innerwear sales stands at $594 million, down 2.8% from the year-ago period.  Also, the fourth quarter is likely to be impacted by additional marketing investments; the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Q4 Expectations in NumbersConsidering all factors, the company projects fourth-quarter net sales in a band of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, with the mid-point depicting an increase of nearly 3% on an organic basis. This outlook is based on a conservative view for the U.S. sales landscape; sales of roughly $15 million expected from Alternative Apparel and negative effects from Sears Canada bankruptcy. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 51 cents to 53 cents, while GAAP earnings per share are projected to range from 47-49 cents.The earnings estimate (both GAAP and adjusted) includes 5 cents from higher marketing investment, greater mix of International sales and the expected adverse impact from Sears Canada bankruptcy somewhat negated by greater-than-expected buyout synergies.  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 53 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period. This estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,631 million, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Hanesbrands is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Unfortunately, Hanesbrands fails both the criteria, as the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has an Earnings ESP of -0.14%.

198,SJM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this major tobacco player will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Unfortunately, Phillip Morris has lagged earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 5.4%.Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteHowever, the company is undertaking solid efforts to expand in the reduced risk products space, given the stringent regulations on tobacco products and consumers becoming more health conscious. Thus, let’s see if the company can reverse the dismal trend this time.Factors at PlayPhilip Morris has been bearing the brunt of lower cigarette volumes, which can be largely accountable to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers also resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally. Together, these factors have been weighing on cigarette industry volumes. Incidentally, Philip Morris’ net revenues during third-quarter 2017 were hurt by 3.6% in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also fell 4.1%. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume dipped 0.5%.To make matters worse, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to put up self-critical advertisements circulated through television, newspapers, social media and store displays. Such headwinds plaguing the tobacco industry remain a concern for Philip Morris’ combustible products category performance. Well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter cigarette volumes is currently pegged at $207 million.Reduced Risk Products & Pricing – Major Growth DriversGiven the aforementioned industry conditions, Philip Morris diverted its attention to reduced risk products (RRPs) to propel growth. Evidently, Philip Morris launched the iQOS (in 2014), a smokeless cigarette, in approximately 31 markets globally and catered to more than 3.7 million consumers globally, excluding the United States. The company expects to gain from increased volumes in reduced risk tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, HeatSticks and iQOS products. Philip Morris has also been making several investments to expand the capacity of its heated tobacco products.Thanks to the growing popularity of such products, Philip Morris generated revenues worth $947 million from RRPs in third-quarter 2017, up from $212 million in the year-ago period. Also, revenues from RRPS, along with strong pricing more than offset soft cigarette volumes, helping Phillip Morris deliver year-over-year top and bottom-line growth in the third quarter. While, revenues declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA), the same increased across Asia, and Latin America & Canada — largely fueled by greater revenues from RRPs. The consensus mark for net sales in Asia and Latin America & Canada is $6,648 million and $2,662 million, up from $5,517 million and $2,571 million, respectively.In fact, the company’s overall sales have been rising annually for more than a year now on the back of such efforts. Also, Phillip Morris enjoys a strong pricing power, which helps it maintain margins at the desired level. Though industry headwinds and unfavorable currency fluctuations remain the major killjoys for Phillip Morris, we expect the aforementioned growth initiatives to continue driving the company in the quarter to be reported.Q4 Estimates as a WholeThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.36, which represents nearly 24% growth from the year-ago period.

200,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer of food products, posted disappointing first-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein both earnings and revenues lagged estimates. Further, the company slashed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.Adjusted earnings in the first quarter came in at $1.51 per share, which were way behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 by 6.2%. Earnings also declined 19% year over year, due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits, which were negatively impacted by planned increases in marketing expense and commodity costs.Revenue and Margin DetailsNet sales in the quarter declined 4% year over year to $1.749 billion. The fall was due to lower volume/mix, notably in coffee and oils, which were partially offset by gains in pet food. Net pricing added 1 percentage point to net sales, as higher net pricing for coffee and the Smucker's brand was partially offset by lower net pricing within the company's U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Currency negatively impacted sales by $1.8 million. Net sales also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.816 billion by 3.7%. Notably, sales have posted negative surprises in five out of the last seven consecutive quarters.Adjusted gross profit fell 10% due to lower volume/mix, higher costs and unfavorable pricing. Despite cost-saving initiatives, the company’s adjusted operating profit declined 17% due to lower gross profits.The weakness in sales and earnings is well reflected in the company’s share price movement. Smucker’s shares have decreased 15.7% in the last six months, in comparison to the industry, which declined just 4.6% in the same time frame. On the contrary, the broader Consumer Staple sector grew 3.6% in the last six months.Segment PerformanceU.S. Retail Coffee Market: The company's biggest segment, U.S. Retail Coffee Market, reported a 6% decline in sales to $480.8 million. This was primarily due to 8% lower volume/mix driven by lower volume for the Folgers brand, partially offset by gains for the Dunkin' Donuts and Café Bustelo brands. The lower volume/mix was mostly offset by 2% higher net price realization.Segment profit declined 29% to $123.8 million, due to the negative impact of volume/mix, lower net pricing and higher commodity costs. Encouragingly, the company anticipates the impact of higher costs to moderate throughout the remainder of the fiscal 2018.U.S. Retail Consumer Foods: This segment’s sales declined 8% in the quarter to $492.4 million. Higher net price realization, driven by the Smucker's and Crisco brands, added 3% to the sales, but was offset by 11% lower volume/mix, primarily attributed to the Crisco, Pillsbury and Smucker’s brands.Segment profit was flat at $110.9 million as the impact of lower volume/mix was offset by higher pricing and reduced marketing expense.U.S. Retail Pet Foods: Segment net sales were almost flat at $521.7 million in the quarter, as improved volume/mix, primarily related to the Nature's Recipe and Natural Balance brands was mostly offset by lower net price realization across the portfolio. Segment profit declined 20% to $98.3 million due to decline in sales, lower pricing, higher commodity costs as well as higher marketing expense.International and Away from Home: Effective May 1, 2017, the company's U.S. Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home.Net sales of the segment increased 3% from the prior-year quarter to $254.0 million, reflecting favorable volume/mix driven by the Jif and Smucker's brands.  Net price realization improved, but was offset by currency headwinds. Segment profit declined 3% to $38.3 million as top-line growth were more than offset by unfavorable currency, higher commodity costs, and expenses related to the construction of the Smucker's Uncrustables production facility in Longmont, Colorado.J.M.

202,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and the bottom lines fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to industry hurdles. Shares of the company lost 7.9% during the pre-market trading session.In fact, the company’s shares have dropped 9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 10.6% decline.Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of $1.93 per share jumped 7% year over year, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The J. M. Smucker Company QuoteNet sales of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remained almost flat year over year at $1,781.3 million, while it missed the consensus estimate of $1,807 million. Unfavorable volume/mix hurt net sales by nearly one percentage point, mainly due to weakness across oils, peanut butter and baking categories, somewhat compensated by strength in coffee. However, sales were positively impacted by improved net price realization and favorable currency movements. Markedly, net sales received benefits of $4.6 million owing to favorable currency exchange.Adjusted gross profit climbed 1% to $674.8 million, whereas adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 37.9%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased roughly 3% to $348.3 million, with the adjusted operating margin improving 60 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted operating income growth was backed by a decline in SD&A costs.Segment PerformanceU.S. Retail Coffee Market: The company's U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment sales came in at $508.2 million, which increased $2.3 million from the prior-year period. This was backed by favorable volume/mix, primarily attributable to Dunkin' Donuts and Folgers brand. This was somewhat countered by lower net price realization at the Folgers brand.Segment profit jumped 4% to $156 million, due to improved volume/mix and lower input costs, somewhat negated by escalated marketing costs and reduced pricing.  U.S. Retail Consumer Foods:  Sales in the segment dipped 2% to $465.3 million. Higher net price realization was more than offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly led by Crisco, Jif and Pillsbury brands, partly compensated by Smucker brand gains.Segment profit increased 5% to $114.1 million, as the impact of lower volume/mix was more than offset by improved pricing and costs.U.S. Retail Pet Foods: Net sales dipped $0.9 million to $533.6 million owing to lower volume/mix, mainly due to certain voluntary product recalls. This was partly countered by better net price realization. Segment profit tumbled 13% to $102.1 million owing to unfavorable volume/mix, pricing and costs. Charges associated with product recalls also hurt segment profit.International and Away from Home: Effective May 1, 2017, the company's U.S. Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home.Net sales grew 2% from the prior-year quarter to $274.2 million, courtesy of favorable volume/mix and positive impacts of currency rates.  This was partly countered by lower net price realization. Segment profit rose 2% to $49.6 million, thanks to positive currency impact, reduced marketing costs as well as a net benefit from reduced pricing and expenses.FinancialsSmucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $192.6 million, long-term debt of $4,688.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $7,891.1 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to $314.4 million for the quarter, when the company generated free cash flow of $202.8 million during the quarter. During fiscal 2018, Smucker generated free cash flow of $896.1 million.Fiscal 2019 OutlookManagement remains focused on placing its portfolio for growth. The company has been undertaking innovations to cater to the evolving consumer demand. Evidently, Smucker introduced 1850 premium coffee and Jif PowerUps, recently. Also, Smucker’s buyout of Ainsworth has solidified its pet foods portfolio. Moreover, management is considering the sale of its U.S. baking business, which highlights its strategy of portfolio optimization and shifts focus to the growing coffee, snacking, and pet food categories. Smucker also remains on track with its cost-containment plans, which helped it make investments in its core growth brands including Dunkin' Donuts, Smucker's Uncrustables and Nature's Recipe.All said, the company expects net sales for fiscal 2019 to advance 13% year over year to reach $8.3 billion.The company envisions fiscal 2019 earnings in the range of $8.40-$8.65 per share, up from $7.96 recorded in fiscal 2017. The upside is likely to be backed by gains from Ainsworth buyout, cost-saving efforts and benefits from U.S. tax reforms. Evidently, effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be roughly 24.5%, lower than the fiscal 2018 rate of 29.6%.However, increased marketing costs, rising freight and raw material costs, and increased interest expenses are likely to weigh on bottom line. Incidentally, the company expects marketing costs to rise considerably, particularly to support the launches of 1850 coffee and Jif PowerUps.Free cash flow is projected to be approximately $800-$850 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be $350-$370 million in fiscal 2019.Don’t Miss These Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

204,SJM,"With brand innovations and strong prospects from acquired businesses rolled up in its sleeve, The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is well positioned to greet 2018. Lately, this global marketer and distributor of food and beverage items has been riding on strong brand performance, fueling growth across most business segments. However, higher freight costs and tight market conditions for green coffee may pose significant hurdles for the company.Nevertheless, investors are enthusiastic about the stock, as evident from the company’s gain of 19% in the past three months, comparing favorably with the industry’s 6.1% rally.Strong Brands Act as Valuable Growth DriverSmucker's reasonably-priced high-quality products make the brand a popular pick.  In this regard, the Jif, Smucker's, Nature's Recipe and Uncrustable brands have been performing well over the past few quarters. In fact, the company has been constructing a frozen sandwich plant in Colorado to enhance the capacity of Uncrustable brand.Owing to the sturdy growth portrayed by the company’s brands, Smucker was able to deliver a year-over-year top-line increase of 0.5% in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Increased net pricing for peanut butter and the Smucker’s brand were the key growth catalysts. Notably, this marked a turning point from the dismal top-line results witnessed in the preceding five quarters.Further, Smucker regularly undertakes innovation to continue adding products to its already rich brand line-up. Recent launches include Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee and Natural Balance high-protein dog food offerings. These launches contributed significantly toward sales growth during the second quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Acquisitions Yielding Positively  Acquisitions have been a preferred strategy for many food and grocery firms to augment market reach and offerings. Smucker’s has also been treading on this path. Notably, the company’s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (KGM) and Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc, to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products, has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. The company has been consistently extending partnership with KGM to augment K-Cup business opportunities.Other instances include the acquisitions of Big Heart Pet Brand, Sahale Snacks, Enray Inc. and Rowland Coffee amongst many others. These acquisitions have added iconic brands to the company’s portfolio and strengthened its presence in the industry.Freights Costs & Green Coffee Price Pose Worries   The negative impacts from adverse weather conditions and new systems required to be implemented are expected to tighten the freight market conditions in the upcoming periods. As a result, management expects a rise in costs for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and has, thereby, lowered the high end of its fiscal earnings guidance. It now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of $7.75-$7.90 per share, compared with the previous range of $7.75-$7.95.Further, green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time, affecting profits from the coffee segments. During second-quarter 2018, profits from the U.S. Retail Coffee segment declined 18.2% primarily due to higher costs of green coffee and unfavorable volume/mix impacts.Efforts to Offset HurdlesWe expect Smucker to easily tide over the aforementioned hurdles, backed by dedicated savings strategies. During the second quarter, the company generated cost savings of approximately $200 million from its pet food synergy program. Per the company’s ongoing cost management program, Smucker plans to achieve $450 million of total annual synergies and cost reductions by fiscal 2020. Additionally, the company plans to achieve $100 million of its $250 million cost-management program by the end of fiscal 2018.   All said, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to march with full steam in 2018, on the back of strong core brands as well as other business expansion and efficiency enhancing efforts.Looking for More Stocks in Consumer Staples?

218,SJM,"I don't know of any of other reason to explain why the stock markets rallied during Thanksgiving week and held onto much of their gains this week.
"
219,SJM,"Let's look at the facts.
"
220,SJM,"The recession is getting worse. The ISM manufacturing index set a new 26-year low. Black Friday sales were not enough to prevent November retail sales from being horribly down. 553,000 jobs were lost last month - the biggest drop since December 1974.

222,SJM,"On a technical basis, the Dow has been setting lower highs and lower lows - a bearish trend. My colleague, Kevin Matras, described the chart pattern as a ""sloppy descending triangle""; in other words, a formation that suggests the average could fall lower.
"
223,SJM,"Hope
"
224,SJM,"Yet despite nearly every reason to go lower, the major indexes have been holding up fairly well, all things considered.
"
225,SJM,"The only plausible reason is that traders are hoping that the economy will recover will sooner than later.
"
226,SJM,"The bullish argument is centered on a few key points.
"
227,SJM,"The government is not letting most big companies fail. American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) was thrown a lifeline; albeit at a big cost. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) was given a safety net. The automakers are getting a second chance to explain why they deserve a bailout.
"
228,SJM,"The central banks are cutting interest rates. The ECB and the Bank of England slashed rates yesterday. The Fed could take U.S. rates below 1.0%.
"
229,SJM,"New stimulus is forthcoming. President-elect Obama wants to sign a massive economic package into law as soon as he takes office. The proposal being discussed includes new infrastructure spending as well as tax cuts.
"
230,SJM,"The perception at that housing market is near a bottom. Mortgage rates recently dropped and there were rumors about the U.S. government proposing a program that would allow for 30-year mortgages at 4.5%.
"
231,SJM,"I do believe that the combination of central bank intervention and a big stimulus package will help, if both are used effectively. The big question is timing. If one buys into the argument that the markets look 4-6 months ahead, then late November rebound suggests a recovery could occur in late spring.
"
232,SJM,"I think such sentiment is very optimistic. This said, nobody knows what the second-half of 2009 is going to look like. Therefore, investors would be prudent to follow a more conservative strategy as opposed to taking unnecessary risks.

234,SJM,"In keeping with the theme of following a more conservative strategy, J.M. Smuckers (SJM  -  Free Report) was added to the Focus List this week. The company owns or licenses a wide variety of well-known brands, including Smucker's, Folgers, Crisco, Hungry Jack and Pillsbury. The fundamentals look sound and the stock was trading at a historically low valuation.
"
235,SJM,"I had hoped to add a second stock this week, but nothing that I looked at really excited me or the portfolio committee.

"
237,SJM,"As I said before, the Dow is setting lower highs and lower lows. Though this is a bearish pattern, the one caveat to any chart pattern is that it only holds until it doesn't. In other words, sooner or later, a new pattern will emerge.

266,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Aug 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this food products manufacturerwill be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company delivered an average earnings beat of 4.00% in the trailing four quarters.However, fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker failed to impress investors. While earnings during the quarter fell 19% year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits, sales dipped 1% due to lower net price realization.The dismal quarterly performance was also reflected in the share price performance of the company. If we look into the company’s last six months performance, we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the industry. In the said time frame, shares of the company have declined 13.4%, compared with the industry’s fall of 6.2%. Notably, the industry is part of the bottom 28% of the Zacks Classified industries (185 out of the 265). The broader Consumer Staples sector, which is at top 25% of the Zacks Classified sectors (4 out of 16), has increased 2.5% in the said time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has declined 3.0% over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at $1.61 per share, which is also down 13.4% from $1.86 per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.82 billion, almost in line with the prior-year period.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteFactors to ConsiderOf late, the U.S. Retail Coffee segment, which is Smucker’s biggest revenue generating segment, is going through a rough patch. Owing to escalating coffee costs, Folgers brand has been witnessing reduced volumes. Not only this, Smucker’s Pet Food business has also been facing several challenges. Heightened competition from premium brands and challenges in dry dog food against a deflationary macro environment is weighing on Kibbles 'n Bits brand’s performance. Sourcing challenges have also posed a concern in this segment.The introduction of Nature's Recipe premium pet food in second-quarter fiscal 2017 is anticipated to stabilize Kibbles 'n Bits brand, as well as benefit the entire dog food portfolio. The acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand and the launch of Dunkin Donuts K-cup pods are also fueling sales. Notably, Dunkin Donuts is part of Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report).Smucker also remains hopeful that its cost-reduction initiatives, combined with the restructuring and innovation related efforts, would improve the company’s performance in the near term. However, the company expects earnings to decline due to softness in the coffee and pet foods segments, moving ahead. Smucker’s international business performance also remains under pressure due to currency headwinds.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Smucker is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Smucker has an Earnings ESP of -1.01% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.60 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 per share.

However, its -1.01% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies in the consumer staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:SunOpta, Inc.

267,SJM,"Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 6. In the last reported quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. We note that in the trailing four quarters, this Philadelphia, PA-based company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and expecting Five Below to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 32 cents, reflecting a more than two-fold increase from the year-ago period. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a penny in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $292.3 million, up approximately 25.5% from the year-ago quarter.Which Factors Hold Key to Five Below’s Performance?Five Below remains committed toward expanding its store base, as well as enriching the in-store experience to draw traffic and enhance customer base. The company believes that expanding scale helps it gain access to renowned shopping centers, capitalize on the emerging market trends and increase brand value. In fact, the company’s solid store remodeling is a major reason behind its healthy comps performance.We believe that Five Below’s wide assortment of trend right merchandise, solid in-store and online experience along with favorable pricing strategy are likely to remain major growth drivers. Further, the company remains focused on cost structure, average net sales per store and supply-chain improvement.However, stiff competition from both brick-&-mortar and online retailers remain a concern. Moreover, analysts believe that any strategic investments are likely to keep margins under pressure in the short run.Five Below, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Five Below, Inc.

268,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 7. This consumer food and beverage marketer and manufacturer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.7% in the last reported quarter and has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Smucker this time around.The J. M. Smucker Company Price and EPS Surprise  The J. M. Smucker Company Price and EPS Surprise | The J. M. Smucker Company QuoteFactors Driving SmuckerSmucker is likely to continue gaining from its focus on innovations, prudent acquisitions and solid cost-savings activities. The company has long been committed toward brand building through product innovation. Its recent launches include Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee and Meow Mix Servings cat food. These launches contributed significantly toward sales growth during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In fact, management stated that products launched over the past three years delivered net sales growth of nearly 7% during the third quarter.Buyouts have been a driving factor for Smucker as well. To this end, the company’s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc, to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products, has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Other evidences in this regard include Smucker’s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand, Sahale Snacks, Enray Inc. along with coffee brands and business operations of Rowland Coffee among others. These acquisitions have added iconic brands to the company’s portfolio and strengthened its presence in the United States. Apart from Smucker, other food companies, such as TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report), United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), have been consistently expanding their business and competitive power through strategic acquisitions.Escalated Costs to be Offset?Moving back to Smucker, the company continues to bear the brunt of higher freight expenses, which hurt its margins in the third quarter. In fact, management stated that the freight costs were greater than anticipated, owing to difficult transportation landscape in the United States. The company expects these headwinds to linger in the fourth quarter, which along with charges related to inventory obsolesce compelled it to lower its gross margin view for fiscal 2018.Nevertheless, Smucker’s cost savings efforts to enhance its operating performance bode well. Earlier in fiscal 2018, the company generated synergies of nearly $200 million from its pet food synergy program. Based on such cost-management programs, various other efforts to enhance cost discipline and expected gains from the recent K-Cup partnership, Smucker intends to achieve cost savings of $100 million in fiscal 2018, giving out positive signals for the quarter to be reported.We expect these endeavors along with focus on buyouts and innovations to help Smucker offset the cost hurdles. In fact, these factors also aided Smucker in the last reported quarter, wherein both the top and bottom line improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While earnings were fueled by solid sales and benefits from tax reforms, revenues were backed by growth across most core brands and categories. Further, favorable volume/mix (mainly in pet food and coffee segments) and favorable currency translations aided sales growth. For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales at the company’s U.S. Retail Coffee segment to increase 1.8% year over year to approximately $515 million.Q4 Estimates in NumbersFurther, analysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $1,809 million, up 1.4% from the year-ago period reported figure. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.21, which shows a 22.8% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Smuckeris likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

269,SJM,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 6, after the market closes. While many grocery firms reel under consumer’s shifting preferences and stiff competition from industry biggies, others like United Natural have been thriving well, buoyed by yielding strategies to match the changing industry scenario. Well, United Natural has been setting quite a treat with its strong footing in organic foods space and a rapidly growing presence in the e-commerce arena.Notably, the company’s bottom-line results have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 10.7%. Let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly release and see if this renowned distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak.Surging Demand & Effective Growth PlansUnited Natural has been gaining from increasing demand for better-for-you products. Amid rising health consciousness among consumers, the company’s wide offerings in the organic segment provides it with adequate opportunities. Apart from this, the company is committed toward achieving core strategic targets for 2018. These include plans to enhance customer base, expand broadline distribution channel and improve gross margin.Further, the company strives to develop effective sourcing processes and supply chain networks to better align supplies with demand and meet consumers’ needs more efficiently.

With sophisticated distribution networks and fulfillment centers, the company’s growth in this space is quite remarkable, which had aided top-line growth in the second quarter.

Notable buyouts of the company include The Gourmet Guru, Haddon House and Nor-Cal Produce amongst others. Apart from United Natural, other food companies such as TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report) have been consistently expanding their business and competitive power through strategic acquisitions.United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Natural Foods, Inc. QuoteStrained Gross Margin a WorryUnited Natural’s sales from lower margin customers has been growing at a higher rate than other customers which has been denting gross margin rates, as witnessed during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018. Higher inbound freight costs also weighed on gross margin during the second quarter. In fact, management continues to expect higher freight rates throughout the balance of fiscal 2018, thereby raising concerns for the upcoming quarterly results.Estimates Instill OptimismUnited Natural’s effective strategies to boost sales keep us encouraged that the company will easily tide over the aforementioned hurdles and deliver a solid performance in the third quarter. Well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the impending quarter is currently pegged at 93 cents, depicting a surge of almost 20.8% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $2,579 million for the quarter to be reported, reflecting an improvement of approximately 8.9% from the year-ago quarter’s tally.A Look at the Zacks ModelTo top it, our proven model shows that United Natural is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

270,SJM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, J.M. Smucker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts J.M. Smucker’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 18.3) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that J.M. Smucker has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for J.M. Smucker’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, J.M. Smucker has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, J.M. Smucker currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes SJM a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for J.M. Smucker is just 1.4, a level that is somewhat lower than the industry average of 2.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 9.7, which is slightly better than the industry average of 12.6. Clearly, SJM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though J.M. Smucker might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C. This gives SJM a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has slipped 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The J. M. Smucker Company Price and Consensus  The J. M. Smucker Company Price and Consensus | The J. M. Smucker Company QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineJ.M. Smucker is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 29% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

271,SJM,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) maintains its commitment to enhance shareholders’ value through dividend payouts. Recently, management has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 14% to 32.50 cents per share from the previous payout of 28.50 cents.Effective third-quarter 2017, the new dividend will be paid on Oct 9, to shareholders of record as on Aug 29, 2017. This brings the company’s annualized dividend to $1.30 per share, representing an increase from the previous annualized rate of $1.14 per share.Notably, this was the fifth dividend hike by Pinnacle Foods since the initiation of its quarterly dividend program shortly after its IPO in March 2013. The last dividend hike of 12% to 28.50 cents per share was announced in August 2016.Dividend hike is frequent among companies with a stable cash position and healthy cash flows. We believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Basically, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it.Apart from Pinnacle Foods, companies like The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) and Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividends by 4% to 78 cents and 12.5% to 22.50 cents per share, respectively.Another company that remains keen on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments is Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) since 1895. Keeping up with this trend, the company hiked quarterly dividend by 3% to 40 cents in March, compared with the previous payout of 39 cents per share.However, following the dividend hike announcement, very less movement was noticed in the Pinnacle Foods' shares yesterday. Shares of this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products have inched up a meager 1% yesterday. Nonetheless, the stock has rallied 10.4% in the last six months against the industry’s decline of 4.3%. Currently, the industry is placed at the bottom 21% of the Zacks classified industries (203 out of 256).Pinnacle Foods boasts a strong brands portfolio, and also make acquisitions to grow its distribution network as well as customer base. Further, it has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain, which remains encouraging.In July, Pinnacle Foods posted mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, top line missed the same. With this, the company’s earnings have outperformed the consensus mark in seven of the trailing nine quarters. Currently, Pinnacle Foods carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

272,SJM,"Despite softness in the coffee and pet foods segments, The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), has managed to keep its shareholders happy through regular dividend payments.The board of directors recently approved an increase of 4% in its quarterly dividend, from $0.75 to $0.78 per common share. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to shareholders held in record at the close of business on Aug 11. This represents the company’s 16th consecutive year of dividend growth.However, the dividend growth rate was lower when compared with year-ago numbers. Smucker increased its quarterly dividend by 12% in 2016, by 5% in 2015, by 10% in 2014 and by 11.5% in 2013.In addition to dividend payment, the company actively repurchases shares. During the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company completed the 3 million share repurchase program that was announced in February.In fiscal 2017, the company returned over $775 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends, up from $750 million of cash returned to shareholders last year, reflecting strong cash flow. In fact, in the last five fiscal years, the company has returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Stock Price Performance and Estimates RevisionIf we look into the company’s share price performance over the past six months, we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the Zacks categorized Food–Miscellaneous/Diversified industry. In the said time frame, shares of the company have declined 12.5%, compared with the industry’s fall of 5.3%. Challenging coffee and pet foods segments seems to have pressurized the stock.Moreover, the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker were not quite impressive. While earnings during the quarter fell 19% year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits, sales edged down 1% due to lower net price realization. The fall was witnessed in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment and an unfavorable mix in the U.S. Retail Coffee segment.The dismal quarterly performance has also lowered analysts’ expectations. Estimates for the first quarter and for fiscal 2018 have gone down by a penny to reach $1.67 and $7.97 respectively, over the last 30 days.Bottom LineDespite such unfavorable trends, we are encouraged with Smucker’s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand, the launch of Dunkin Donuts K-cup pods and expanded distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand which are fueling sales. The company remains focused on expanding its business though sustained innovation, cost-cutting initiatives and efforts to expand e-commerce sales. Smucker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and carries a long term growth rate of 7.3%.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Still Interest You?

273,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company’s (SJM  -  Free Report) top line has been gaining from improved performance of its brands. In fact, growth in several key brands boosted the company’s top-line performance during second-quarter fiscal 2018. Further, the company is on track with product innovation efforts. It has also been augmenting offerings through acquisitions and partnerships.Driven by such factors, shares of the company have gained 8.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 2.5%. However, the company has been struggling with the performance of its coffee segment, due to price volatility. Let’s analyze all aspects and see if Smucker’s strategic efforts can help offset the hurdles and drive growth.Smucker’s Brand Strengthening Efforts Bode WellSmucker boasts a strong brand portfolio, which include high-quality products that are moderately priced. We note that the Jif, Smucker's, Nature's Recipe and Uncrustable brands have been performing favorably over the past few quarters. Incidentally, the company has been constructing a frozen sandwich plant in Colorado to enhance the capacity of Uncrustable brand. The growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Recent launches include Natural Balance high-protein dog food offerings and Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee. Notably, these launches contributed significantly toward sales growth during the second quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Additionally, Smucker’s rich brands line-up gains from key partnerships and acquisitions. The company’s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Further, the company’s focus on achieving expansion via acquisitions is evident from its planned buyout of Wesson oil brand from Conagra Brands. The deal is currently subject to regulatory approval.Barriers in Smucker’s WaySmucker has been struggling with volatility in the prices of green coffee. Coffee prices are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, pest infestation, political decisions as well as worldwide supply and demand conditions. Notably, green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time, thereby denting profits in the coffee segment.Further, management expects a rise in freight costs, stemming from industry-wide headwinds to hurt performance in the forthcoming periods. Accordingly, the company lowered the high end of its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance in the last reported quarter.Final ThoughtsWe expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s concentration on strengthening core brands to drive the top line and offset the aforementioned hurdles. We are also encouraged with the company’s savings-boosting initiatives, which are likely to fuel investments and enhance performance in the long term. Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

338,SJM,"General Mills Sees Good Demand
"
339,SJM,"Last week, General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter profits of 86 cents per share. The results topped expectations by 5 cents and represented year-over-year growth of 18%.
"
340,SJM,"Revenues increased 5%, though the actual growth would have been higher were it not for currency fluctuations. Domestically, the company saw strong demand for many of its brands, including Cheerios, Bisquick, Yoplait and Totino's. Internationally, sales rose, but GIS could not convert those gains into higher profits because of the dollar.
"
341,SJM,"Nonetheless, General Mills thinks it can continue to grow in fiscal 2010, especially if commodity costs don't rise sharply. The company guided for full-year profits of $4.20 to $4.25 per share.

343,SJM,"Smuckers Gets A Big Boost From Folgers Acquisition
"
344,SJM,"General Mills' bullish report was preceded by good numbers from J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report). SJM topped fiscal fourth-quarter expectations by 41 cents with adjusted profits of $1.02 per share. EPS jumped 40% year-over-year.
"
345,SJM,"The results were inflated by the acquisition of Folgers, which accounted for 42% of sales. However, even when Folgers is excluded, SJM performed well. Pillsbury and Hungry Jack both saw volume gains. Higher prices also had an impact on revenue growth.
"
346,SJM,"Peanut butter sales were down, though the segment is recovering. (The FDA's recall of another manufacturer's peanut products damaged sales across the entire industry.) As was the case with GIS, the stronger dollar was a drag on overall revenue and profit growth.
"
347,SJM,"SJM raised its fiscal 2010 adjusted profit guidance to between $3.65 and $3.80 per share. Previously, the company had guided for profits of $3.62 to $3.72 per share. All of the covering analysts raised their forecasts in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate 38 cents higher to $3.75 per share.

"
350,SJM,"K has topped expectations during 8 out of the last 9 quarters. Two analysts recently raised their second-quarter forecasts and 3 raised their full-year forecasts. The consensus estimate calls for K to have earned 81 cents per share last quarter. Kellogg is scheduled to report on Jul 30.
"
351,SJM,"Though CPO disappointed investors with its first-quarter earnings, the company had previously topped expectations for 5 consecutive quarters. One analyst recently raised his second-quarter profit projection and 2 raised their full-year forecasts. The consensus second-quarter estimate calls for profits of 32 cents per share, though the most accurate estimate is far more bullish at 39 cents per share. CPO is scheduled to report on Jul 28.
"
352,SJM,"If K and CPO release good results, Nestle S.A. (NSRGY  -  Free Report) could rise in response. Though the company is not scheduled to release first-half results until Aug 12, the full-year consensus estimate has been revised upward by 11 cents higher over the past 30 days.

"
358,SJM,"Record-Setting Results
"
359,SJM,"On Jun 18 the company reported fourth-quarter results that included an 81% increase in sales. The addition of Folgers drove sales in addition to pricing decisions driving organic growth.
"

"
361,SJM,"Analysts Love It
"
362,SJM,"Since the report all 6 analysts have raised their full-year 2010 forecasts. The consensus estimate popped 38 cents to $3.75. Forecasts for next year are now averaging $4.07, up 51 cents in that time period. 
"

366,SJM,"The JM Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is fresh off the heels of gapping open higher after reporting strong fourth-quarter results on June 19 that were ahead of expectations. After the solid quarter, analysts boosted their earnings projections, with the current-year tacking on 38 cents and climbing to $3.75 per share. The next-year estimate is up 51 cents in the same period to $4.07, a 9% earnings growth projection. 
"
367,SJM,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS) continues to be a steady player in a choppy market. The company's share price has rebounded nicely after dipping lower earlier in the year, currently trading near the $22 mark. The estimate picture looks solid too, with the current-year up 10 cents in the last 60 days to $1.77 per share.
"
368,SJM,"The J. M. Smucker Company’s (SJM  -  Free Report) previously-announced strategic move to acquire Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC, was concluded on May 14. Smucker acquired Ainsworth in a transaction worth $1.7 billion, after considering tax gains of about $200 million. The transaction was funded through a combination of term loan and commercial paper borrowings.Significance of the TakeoverConsumers’ rising consciousness regarding the health and wellness of pets has strengthened the traction of the pet foods category. Driven by such a market scenario, building strength in this category is an appropriate strategy by Smucker. Moreover, Ainsworth is a renowned name in the premium pet foods segment with popular brands like Rachael Ray Nutrish that will fortify the company’s portfolio. Incidentally, the Rachael Ray brand accounts for about two-thirds of Ainsworth's sales.Well, this is not the first time that Smucker has undertaken strategic efforts to strengthen its footing in pet foods. In 2015, it acquired Big Heart Pet Brand that added iconic brands such as Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. The buyout has been bolstering the company’s pet food business. Incidentally, net sales in the company’s U.S. Retail Pet Foods category inched up 2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, owing to improved volume/mix. These were primarily related to the Nature's Recipe brand and the company’s pet snacks portfolio. With the inclusion of Ainsworth, we expect Smucker to expand further in this category.Apart from Smucker, General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has also been striving to expand in this category and recently concluded the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. Further, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is also looking toward invading this category, evident from its recent launch of the Wag brand.Focus on Buyouts & Brand Expansion Bodes WellThe food industry is rife with stiff competition and shifting consumer preferences. Amid this scenario, companies like Smucker and United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report) often resort to strategic tie-ups to augment their offerings and stay afloat. Smucker actively pursues strategic acquisitions in the United States as well as overseas. Its agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Further, the growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Moreover, Smucker’s cost-saving initiatives have also contributed effectively toward undertaking brand augmenting efforts.Wrapping it UpDespite the aforementioned upsides, Smucker’s performance has long been eclipsed by higher freight expenses, which has been weighing upon its gross margin performance. Additionally, lower net price realization has dampened Smucker’s performance in several segments. Well, such deterrents have dragged the company’s shares by almost 10.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 16.1%.Nevertheless, we are confident about the company’s ability to offset such headwinds with well-chalked cost-reduction measures and efforts to boost top line. We hope that such endeavors will uplift investors’ optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in the forthcoming periods.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

369,SJM,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 18, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.5%. Though it reported a negative earnings surprise in three of the four trailing quarters, it delivered an average beat of 1.3%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting an increase of 3.4% year over year. Earnings estimates for the quarter have declined in the past 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.14 billion, up about 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteCampbell Soup has lagged the industry in the past month, reflecting a negative sentiment on the stock, ahead of the earnings release. The company’s shares have declined 5%, wider than the industry’s fall of 2.4%. The decline can be attributed to a volatile operating environment and a continued dismal performance at the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division.Factors at PlayPersistent challenges in the U.S. soup category and Campbell Fresh division have been weighing on the stock’s performance. Further, the company’s margins remain under pressure, owing to higher cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses and an adverse mix. Moreover, the company anticipates gross margin for fiscal 2018 to decline nearly 1 percentage point due to higher inflation and logistics costs as well as the impact of increased promotional-spending for soup. Backed by the soft gross margin forecast, the company projects adjusted EBIT to decline 5-7% compared with 2-4%, guided earlier.Further, Campbell Soup witnessed a 2% decline in organic sales in the fiscal second quarter, owing to lower volumes in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment due to the persistent challenges in U.S. soup category. Notably, U.S. Soup sales declined 7% on account of a drop in condensed soups as well as ready-to-serve soups. This decline was mainly due to Campbell Soup’s failure to reach an agreement with a key customer on a promotional approach for soup in fiscal 2018. Further, the company’s C-Fresh division results disappointed, driven by headwinds in the super-premium juice category.Campbell remains focused on getting the C-Fresh division back on growth track and solving its key customer issue, thereby expecting moderate soup sales in the second half of fiscal 2018. Entering the spring season, the company expects its initiatives to boost beverage results in the second half.  Further, the company’s solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term. Despite efforts to improve these segments, the company anticipates sales growth to range from negative 1% to positive 1% for fiscal 2018.Further, Campbell is progressing well with its cost-saving plan as it raised the annualized savings target to $500 million, which is expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020. It is making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and accelerate growth. Recently, Campbell completed the buyout of Snyder’s-Lance, Inc., which is likely to fortify its snacks portfolio.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Campbell Soup Company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

370,SJM,"Stocks advanced on positive reports from homebuilders and retailers. Also helping todays bullish atmosphere was Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke denying that he pressured Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) to buy Merrill Lynch. Observers noted that Bernankes conduct in front of Congress signaled that he would not resign before his term is up. 
"
371,SJM,"Some are under the impression that resignation may be a possibility as certain lawmakers have alleged that he threatened to throw out Bank of America's CEO Kenneth Lewis or the bank's board members if BAC would not go through with the Merrill takeover.  However, Bernanke defended himself, denying the allegations and stating that the central bank acted with the highest integrity.

390,SJM,"Friday is a quadruple witching day, meaning option and futures contracts will expire. This could lead to higher volatility.
"
391,SJM,"What should be interesting to see is whether we get some end-of-quarter window dressing by fund managers. Many have been sitting on the sidelines - as is evident by the light volume - and are likely underperforming their benchmarks. This raises the possibility that we could see managers buying ""good"" stocks to make their portfolio holdings look better.

"
402,SJM,"J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) and Centerpoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) were supposed to be ""safe"" picks for the portfolio. After all, SJM was a food company and more than half of CNP's earnings came from operating an electric utility.
"
403,SJM,"On Wednesday, both stocks fell in reaction to disappointing guidance. We promptly removed both stocks as a result. The holding period for these so-called safe picks was less than 2 months.
"
404,SJM,"SJM fell victim to the ongoing peanut scare. Though the company has stated that its products were not tainted, jars of Jif are not moving.
"
405,SJM,"CNP blamed slowing growth and lower energy usage by customers for crimping fourth-quarter income and 2009 guidance.
"
406,SJM,"On the flip side, banking stocks surged Thursday morning on the prospect that they won't be nationalized. Yet, some of these companies have been the victims of very bad decisions by management.
"
407,SJM,"When times were good, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) was constantly criticized for being too big and bloated. Even last year, the company's executives believed they could solve their problems by making C even bigger. Now, taxpayers are about to own a considerable chunk of the beleaguered firm.
"
408,SJM,"Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) acquired Countrywide and Merrill Lynch last year. Anybody who shorted BAC when the Countrywide merger was first announced has profited handsomely.
"
409,SJM,"And none of this even touches on their loan writing guidelines (or lack thereof).
"
410,SJM,"In summary, good stocks are going bad and the bad stocks are prone to having some very good days. Is it any wonder why I'm frustrated?
"
411,SJM,"Rest assured, I don't like losing money and I realize you hate it even more. But it is better to take a known loss in a good stock, than risk losing far more by trying to time a bad stock.
"
412,SJM,"The long-term rules for success have not changed. Buy well-run companies with rising earnings estimates that are trading at attractive valuations. Sell stocks when the reason for buying them no longer applies.

428,SJM,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), also known as AB InBev, is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 9. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered positive earnings surprise of 6.1%.In fact, fourth-quarter 2017 marked the company’s first earnings beat after seven consecutive quarters of negative surprises, while revenues surpassed estimates after two straight misses. It recorded an average negative surprise of 12.3% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to ExpectThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.8%. However, estimates witnessed a downtrend in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total revenues of 12.8 billion, which reflects a decline of 0.7% year over year.Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV QuoteAdditionally, the AB InBev stock has been witnessing a downtrend lately, mainly due to a soft outlook for first-quarter 2018. The stock has declined 10.4% in the past month, wider than the industry’s fall of 5%, reflecting a bearish sentiment ahead of the earnings release.Factors at PlayWhile AB InBev's fourth-quarter 2017 results marked a return to the positive earnings trajectory, a soft outlook for the first quarter seems to be weighing upon its performance. The company envisions a soft first quarter, owing to difficult comparisons, and phasing of marketing and sales initiatives. Moreover, the company is witnessing volatility in certain key markets.However, AB InBev’s robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach remain major strengths. Further, given the rising demand for craft beer space, we expect the company to benefit from its constant expansion in this category. Also, it keeps introducing near-beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers, which is encouraging.Additionally, the company remains well on track with the SABMiller integration. It expects synergies and cost savings of nearly $3.2 billion from the integration, which are expected to be realized in four years from the closing of the acquisition (or by October 2020).The company anticipates delivering strong top-line growth for 2018, backed by solid brands performance and robust commercial plans. Furthermore, we believe AB InBev is poised to grow driven by the strength of the Budweiser brand and robust initiatives.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that AB InBev is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.AB InBev’s Earnings ESP of +4.46% and Zacks Rank #3 make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

429,SJM,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8. The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, missing estimates in five of the trailing seven quarters. In the remaining two quarters, it reported in line results. Also, the company lagged sales estimates in 10 of the last 13 quarters.We expect Dean Foods to continue with its dismal surprise history in the quarter to be reported on both earnings and revenue front. Apparently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents for the first quarter declined by a penny in the last 30 days and portrays a year-over-year decrease of 7.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of $1.84 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.Dean Foods Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dean Foods Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDean Foods has long been facing challenges related to lower product volumes, escalated raw milk costs and loss of share in U.S. fluid milk volumes. Also, the company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others — the prices of which often fluctuate. Therefore, any rise in price of these commodities is likely to hurt margins and profitability.In the last reported quarter, adjusted gross profit declined 9.9% while the adjusted operating income decreased by 39.2%. Besides missing sales and earnings estimates in fourth-quarter 2017, bottom line plunged 34.2% year over year while top line fell 4.1%. Moreover, total volumes across all products dropped 6% from the year-ago quarter.Per sources, softening demand for milk in the United States has been taking a toll on Dean Foods for quite some time now. Non-dairy substitutes such as almond and oat milk as well as other beverages have been marring demand for milk.Furthermore, the retail grocery industry experienced significant consolidation in recent years. As a result, competition has intensified among dairy product suppliers.The aforementioned headwinds have largely dampened investors’ confidence on the stock. Shares of the company have plunged 57.2% in a year, significantly wider than the Consumer Staples sector’s decline of 7.1%.On the flip side, we remain hopeful about Dean Foods’ cost productivity program, which is expected to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond. These savings are likely to offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non-dairy input costs. Notably, this productivity program focuses on enhancing its supply-chain network, optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and, minimize general and administrative expenses. While some savings are expected to reflect in 2018, the company anticipates increased savings in 2019 and beyond.Additionally, the company’s OpEx 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017 looks encouraging. Under this plan, the company had targeted annual productivity of $80-$100 million. Going ahead, this plan will be extended to the company’s manufacturing and logistics footprint alongside targeting reduction in SG&A expenses.Although Dean Foods’ cost-saving efforts look appeasing, unfortunately it might be unable to offset the headwinds in the near term. So, let’s wait and see what lies in the company’s fate when it reports first-quarter 2018 results.Zacks Model Our proven model does not show that Dean Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dean Foods has an Earnings ESP of -7.54% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which make surprise prediction inconclusive.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Flowers Foods, Inc.

Shares of the company have increased approximately 5% during the pre-market trading session on Nov 16.However, the company lowered the higher end of its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018, thanks to anticipated higher freight expenses and industry-wide headwinds for the remaining part of the fiscal year.  We also note that in the past month the stock has gained 1.8%, as against the industry’s decline of 0.1%.  Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.02 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89. However, earnings declined 1.5% year over year.Net sales in the quarter increased 0.5% year over year to $1,923.6 million and also beat the consensus estimate of $1,895 billion. Sales during the quarter were favorably impacted by increased net pricing for peanut butter and Smuker’s brand. Lower volume/mix stemming from the decline in oil and baking category products were offset by gains from the pet food segment. Net sales received benefits of $5.4 million owing to favorable currency exchange.Adjusted gross profit fell 1.5% to $746.2 million. Adjusted operating income for the reported quarter also declined 3.3% to $383.2 million. Gross margin and adjusted operating margin contracted 80 basis points to 38.8% and 19.9%, respectively.J.M.

Smucker Company (The) QuoteSegment PerformanceU.S.Retail Coffee Market: The company's largest segment, U.S. Retail Coffee Market, reported a 0.2% growth in sales to $552.7 million. This was mainly due to a modest rise in net price realization. Also, lower volume/mix from the Folgers brand was majorly offset by gains reaped from the Dunkin' Donuts and Café Bustelo brands.Segment profit declined 18.2% to $152.6 million, due to higher costs of green and unfavorable volume/mix impacts.  U.S.Retail Consumer Foods:  Sales in the segment declined 4.6% in the quarter to $531.5 million. Higher net price realization, driven by the Jif and Smucker's brands, added 4% to sales. This was offset by 9% lower volume/mix from the Crisco and Pillsbury brands.Segment profit increased 10% to $130.9 million as the impact of lower volume/mix was offset by higher pricing and reduced marketing expense.U.S.Retail Pet Foods: Net sales increased 4% to $521.7 million in the quarter owing to improved volume/mix, primarily related to the Nature's Recipe and Meow Mix brands. Segment profit improved 7% to $122.9 million on the back of positive synergies and cost-saving efforts. These were partially offset by higher marketing expenses.International and Away from Home: Effective May 1, 2017, the company's U.S. Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home.Net sales increased 5% from the prior-year quarter to $287.3 million, reflecting favorable volume/mix driven by the Jif and Smucker's brands and positive impacts of currency rates.  Segment profit increased 4% to reach $53.7 million owing to favorable volume mix and currency rates. These were partially offset by expenses related to the construction of the Smucker's Uncrustables production facility in Longmont, Colorado.FinancialsSmucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $180.3 million, long-term debt of $4.30 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $7 billion. Cash flow from operations amounted to $130.3 million.

The company envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of $7.75-$7.90 per share, compared with the previous range of $7.75-$7.95.

Raven beat earnings estimates twice in a row in the trailing four quarters, with a positive earnings surprise of 15.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderRaven anticipates exceeding prior-year sales and adjusted operating income in fiscal 2018. In applied technology, the company is increasing market share through technological advancements. Through sustained funding of key R&D projects over the last few years, it introduced two significant new products — Hawkeye nozzle control system and next-generation rate control system.

These include the addition of new product designs and installation service components to Raven’s portfolio. The transaction will enable Raven Engineered Films to transform into a vertically-integrated, full-service solutions provider for the geomembrane sector. The acquisition will also help Raven to increase its physical presence by operating facilities in four states, namely South Dakota, Colorado, California and Texas, thereby optimizing its resources and expanding customer services and logistics.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Raven is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.
