0,AZO,"Constant earnings growth captivates almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Notably, earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time.Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Future OutperformersSo, what is earnings acceleration? It is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.Hence, earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.The Winning StrategyLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 17.

1,AZO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 14% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AZO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AutoZone’s Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues MissAutoZone reported earnings of $13.42 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended May 5, 2018), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.99. The figure was $11.44 in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Revenues improved 1.6% year over year to $2.66 billion in the reported quarter. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 billion. Domestic same-store sales (sales of stores open at least for a year) rose 0.6% year over year.Gross profit increased to $1.42 billion from $1.38 billion in the prior-year quarter. Operating profit (EBIT) rose to $545.8 million from $529.6 million registered in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 33% from 32.4% a year ago.Store Opening & InventoryDuring the reported quarter, AutoZone opened 26 new stores and relocated one in the United States. The company also opened four new stores in Mexico. As of May 5, the company had 5,540 stores across 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 536 in Mexico and 16 in Brazil. The total store count was 6,092 as of that date.AutoZone’s inventory improved 3.7% year over year in the quarter under review, driven by store openings and increased product placement, partially offset by the sale of two business units.Inventory per location increased to $658,000 from the year-ago figure of $653,000.Share RepurchasesIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, AutoZone repurchased 599,000 shares for $400 million, reflecting an average price of $667 per share. The company had shares worth $897 million remaining for repurchase at the end of the fiscal third quarter.Financial DetailsAutoZone had cash and cash equivalents of $218.4 million as of May 5, 2018, down from $227.1 million as of May 6, 2017. Total debt amounted to $4.95 billion as of May 5, 2018, compared with $5.15 billion as of May 6, 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.AutoZone, Inc. Price and Consensus  AutoZone, Inc. Price and Consensus | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AZO has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with an A. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and momentum investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, AZO has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

2,AZO,"On Jun 18, we issued an updated research report on AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report).The Memphis, TN-based specialty retailer of automotive replacement parts and accessories, utilizes its cash strength to open new stores every year. In third-quarter 2018, the company opened 26 new stores and relocated one in the United States. The company also opened four new stores in Mexico. As of May 5, the company had 5,540 stores across 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 536 in Mexico and 16 in Brazil. The total store count was 6,092 as of May 5.The company is also putting huge emphasis on its core businesses, as these businesses are immensely lucrative and located in strong markets. The company continues its domestic and overseas expansion efforts by adding around 200 locations annually.However, AutoZone anticipates capital and operating expenses to rise over the next few years owing to its plans to open distribution centers. Although this investment will be beneficial in the long run, the addition of these distribution centers will lead to higher costs for the company over the next few years. Moreover, it is also investing in the development of mega hub stores.In the past three months, shares of AutoZone have underperformed the industry it belongs to. During the period, its stock has witnessed a rise of 5.8% in comparison with the industry’s gain of 12.7%.AutoZone currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past 30 days, both the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the ongoing quarter and full year are tending upwards.A few better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Oshkosh Corporation (OSK  -  Free Report), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) and Ferrari N.V. (RACE  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Oshkosh has an expected long-term growth rate of 18.3%. Shares of the company have risen 4.2% over the past year.Allison Transmission Holdings has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%. Over the past year, shares of the company have gained 11%.Ferrari has an expected long-term growth rate of 17.3%. Over the past year, shares of the company have gained 66.6%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3,AZO,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, AutoZone has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, AutoZone’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that AutoZone has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AutoZone stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, AutoZone has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, AZO is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, AutoZone currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AutoZone a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for AutoZone is just 0.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 12.2, which is better than the industry average of 15.2. Clearly, AZO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though AutoZone might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives AZO a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher. The current fiscal quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen nine upward and one downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.1% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:AutoZone, Inc. Price and Consensus  AutoZone, Inc. Price and Consensus | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteEven though AutoZone has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAutoZone is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 21%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

4,AZO,"For most folks, an earnings season means the 4 to 6 week period at the end of each calendar quarter when earnings announcements dominate market headlines. For us, however, who have to monitor and record each and every earnings release, the definition and duration of each earnings season isn’t that simple. Take for example, the 8 S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results this week.Since we are still a couple of weeks away from the end of the June quarter, most folks would assume that all of these reports represent the tail of the 2018 Q1 earnings season. The reality is that all of these reports get counted as part of the Q2 earnings season. For example, the Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday are for those companies’ fiscal quarters that ended in May, which will form part of our Q2 earnings tally. Looked at this way, the Q2 earnings season actually got underway with the Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) earnings releases with the tally reaching almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time the big banks (unofficially) kick-off the earnings season on July 13th.The weekly reporting calendar (below) for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another four weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.3% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +7.2% revenues, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, but nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.2% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q14 (please note that we have not officially closed the books on Q1 yet, as 2 index members still have to report quarterly results).The chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

5,AZO,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    The Q1 earnings season turned out to be very strong, with growth reaching a 7 year high and broad-based momentum on the revenue side. The focus will now shift to the Q2 earnings season whose early results will start coming out in the next few days.•    Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +17.9% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    For the 498 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are up +24.4% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues, with 76.9% beating EPS estimates and 74.5% beating revenue estimates. The earnings season has ended for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors. •    Except for the proportion of these 498 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates, which are tracking roughly in-line with the preceding quarter’s level, growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods.•    Q1 Earnings growth was in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors, with +0.3% earnings growth on +1.4% higher revenues.•    Energy sector earnings increased +75.7% from the same period last year on +14.2% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +24.4% to +22.7%.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, we now have Q1 results from 96.7% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +30.6% on +9.3% higher revenues, with 54.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.3% beating revenue estimates. In addition to earnings and revenue growth, revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.6% on +6% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.6% and +9.7%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.5% in 2019, and +4.6% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.7X and index close, as of June 7th, is $156.64. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.75 for 2019 (P/E of 16.1X) and $188.40 for 2020 (P/E of 14.7X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWith the Q1 earnings season now effectively behind us, we are shifting our focus to the June quarter whose early results start coming out in the coming days. Most of these early results will be for companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. The recent AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) reports fall in this category. We will have seen results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out Q2 results on July 13th.Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +17.9% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +127.5%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +14.8%.  The one concerning part is the lack of positive revisions to Q2 estimates since the quarter got underway. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Construction, Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +127.5%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +14.8%.  The one concerning part is the lack of positive revisions to Q2 estimates since the quarter got underway. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Construction, Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

11,AZO,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because AutoZone is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AZO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $13.05 per share for AZO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.99 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AZO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.45% heading into earnings season.AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

12,AZO,"Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on May 22.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 18.5%. Per the earnings record, the company beat estimates twice and missed twice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.2%.In the last three months, shares of Advance Auto Parts have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock moved up 11.3% compared with the growth of 1.4% recorded by the industry during the period.Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advance Auto Parts, Inc. QuoteLet’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Advance Auto Parts has an Earnings ESP of +1.41% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98. A positive ESP indicates that an earnings surprise is likely. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?The company’s business depends on the seasonality and weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather generally leads to increased sales as automotive parts stop working at accelerated rates. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects a rise in demand, driven by winter-related demand in key regions.The company is focusing to expand its footprint by opening new stores, widening its online presence and by strategic acquisitions. Further, it aims to reduce inventory costs while improving the availability of products to meet customer needs. In fourth-quarter 2017, Advance Auto Parts announced a strategic partnership with Interstate Batteries, a leading provider of batteries for professional installers. Under the collaboration, the company’s stores and online website will offer the complete lineup of Interstate Batteries.However, funding new stores, maintaining the old ones and investing to develop the supply chain might lead to increased capital expenditure for the company. For 2018, Advance Auto Parts anticipates capital expenditure to be $250 million compared with roughly $189 million in 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderFew other auto stocks worth considering from the same space, comprising the right combination of elements to come up with earnings beat this time around:AutoZone, Inc.

14,AZO,"The auto sector staged a comeback in March after sagging sales performance in February. A majority of automakers reported a rise in their March U.S. sales. A robust economy, product launches and fat discounts enabled auto players to witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. Even concerns over high interest rates and elevated gasoline prices could not deter Americans’ new-found liking for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, albeit at the cost of sedans and passenger cars.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago.Also, during the week, just prior to the March sales release, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) reportedly said that it will do away with the age-old monthly sales report in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that 30 days is too short to absorb short-term volatility, therefore rendering the monthly figures exaggerated. It feels that the quarterly reporting system would better provide the correct picture of the health of the company as well as that of the industry.Also, the electric vehicles (EVs) maker, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) published its production figures for first-quarter 2018, which totaled 34,494 vehicles, up 40% sequentially. This happens to be the most productive quarter in the history of Tesla. Out of the total vehicles produced, 24,728 were Model S and Model X, and 9,766 were Model 3. The Model 3 output increased significantly on a sequential basis. However, the company missed its target of producing 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of first-quarter 2018. Actually, it produced 2020 Model 3 cars over the last seven days. Despite the production target miss, the first-quarter 2018 performance of Tesla looks encouraging.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 29, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Fox Business, Tesla has announced that it will voluntarily recall 123,000 of its luxury Model S sedans across the globe to fix the issue of faulty steering components.The Palo Alto, CA-based company stated that the recall includes Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and is devoid of any Model X or Model 3 versions. The company explained that it has detected “excessive corrosion” in the power steering bolts of the recalled vehicles. This glitch might result in reduced power steering.The EV maker will repair damages by replacing the specific bolts in the power steering component. The company has also intimated its plans to contact the affected customers directly for scheduling an appointment once the parts are available in their respective regions.However, the recent recall has further added to Tesla’s woes, which is already grappling with several challenges, particularly with respect to the production of Model 3 sedan, the low-cost EV targeting the mass market. (Read more: Vehicles Recall Continues Unabated: Tesla, No Exception)Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).2.    In a pioneering move, General Motors has reportedly taken the decision to abandon its usual practice of reporting sales on a monthly basis in favor of quarterly reporting. The U.S. auto giant is of the opinion that sales releases every month do not provide the true picture of the company’s intricate operations or the health of the auto industry, as it includes short-term fluctuations. However, per management, quarterly sales releases will give a better idea about the same.Abandoning monthly sales reports can be attributed to a number of factors. It has been witnessed that the effect of volatility does not smoothen adequately in the 30-day period. This has sometimes resulted in exaggerated monthly sales figures. According to the automaker, incentive campaigns, abnormal weather or product launches tilt monthly sales figures up or down.However, the company intends to provide investors and others a less volatile, longer-term metric to evaluate its performance. Replacing the monthly cycle with a quarterly one is likely to aid the company in this respect. This is echoed in the statement of Kurt McNeil, General Motors’ U.S. vice president for sales operations, “Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market.” McNeil further said, “Reporting sales quarterly better aligns with our business, and the quality of information will make it easier to see how the business is performing.” (Read more: General Motors to Drop Monthly Sales Report, Enticing Others)General Motors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

15,AZO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AZO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AutoZone's Q2 Earnings & Revenue Surpass EstimatesAutoZone reported earnings per share of $10.38 for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 10, 2018), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.81.Revenues improved 5.4% year over year to $2.41 billion in the reported quarter.

16,AZO,"The past week saw heightened activities from auto companies such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Magna International Inc. in the self-driving vehicles front. While General Motors promised investment for upgrading self-driving vehicles manufacturing, Magna announced a partnership with the ride sharing company Lyft, to finance, build and manufacture self-driving systems.However, this week self-driving activities suffered a setback as a test vehicle from leading ridesharing company, Uber Technologies Inc. struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, AZ. Safety issues apart, this sad incident gave a jolt to the self-driving car industry, which is witnessing billions of dollars of investment and has the potential to be a game changer in the transportation space.On the positive side, the week also saw some relaxation in the imposition of tariffs for Canada and Mexico, keeping in mind the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations. President Trump dropped the initial proposal that vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico and intended for the U.S. market should contain at least 50% American materials. This has somewhat relieved the auto industry.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 15, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Superior Industries International Inc.’s (SUP  -  Free Report) adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2017 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents.

However, the reported figure was higher than $188.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Wheel unit shipments were 5.4 million compared with 3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The rise was primarily due to the addition of its European operations, partly offset by a decline in the North American market  from the prior-year quarter. Value-added sales, i.e., net sales minus pass-through charges for aluminum, increased to $203.5 million compared with $106.4 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Gross profit rose to $39.7 million from $18 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the addition of European operations, partly offset by non-recurring effects of purchase accounting adjustments of $1.3 million related to the buyout of UNIWHEELS and ongoing amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition.

In fact, Lyft’s expertise in ridesharing services and the automotive experience of Magna have the capability to make this collaboration a success.Lyft will be the frontrunner in the co-development of the self-driving system at the Palo, Alto-based self-driving center. Magna is likely to lead the manufacturing of the car and join Lyft’s development team.

18,AZO,"It is too early to start talking about the 2018 Q1 earnings season, as we are almost a month away from the big banks kicking-off the latest reporting cycle. That’s when everyone in the market will start paying attention to the Q1 earnings season. Unfortunately for us, we don’t have the luxury to wait that long as we are responsible for maintaining the ‘books’ on every earnings season.While we haven’t (officially) closed the books on the 2017 Q4 earnings season yet (we have results from 499 S&P 500 members at this stage), the 2018 Q1 earnings season has actually gotten underway already. Including Adobe’s (ADBE  -  Free Report) better than expected fiscal February-quarter top- and bottom-line results, we now have Q1 results from three S&P 500 members – AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) are the other two that have already reported fiscal February-quarter results.The bulk of 2018 Q1 results will be comprised of companies coming out with fiscal March-quarter results. But as we all know, fiscal and calendar quarters don’t match for all companies, as is the case with Adobe, AutoZone and Costco whose fiscal quarters ended in February. We club such fiscal February-quarter results as part of our March-quarter tally. It is in this context that the 2018 Q1 earnings season has gotten underway for us already. We have another 10 S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in February on deck to report such 2018 Q1 results this week, which includes a number of industry leaders like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and others.The fact is that by the time the big banks come around to report March-quarter results (Alcoa thankfully no longer has this honor), we will have seen Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members. The chart below shows the weekly calendar of the Q1 earnings season.Expectations for 2018 Q1The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue this reporting cycle as well, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues. This would follow the +13.5% earnings growth on +8.5% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in more than 6 years.There were two aspects of the preceding earning season that really stood out and put that reporting cycle in a category of its own. It will be interesting to see to what extent we see a repeat performance on those two counts in the 2018 Q1 earnings season.These two standout features of the 2017 Q4 earnings season were the very strong momentum on the revenue front and impressive turnaround on the estimate revisions front.The revenue momentum likely reflected a combination of the synchronized global growth environment and a favorable foreign exchange backdrop. With both of those factors still very much in play in Q1 as well, we can reasonably expect to see the revenue momentum trend continue this earnings season as well.The story about trends in 2018 Q1 estimate revisions is better told by the chart below.What this chart shows is that earnings growth expectations for 2018 Q1 moved up significantly since mid-December 2017. This represented a major trend shift relative to what we have been seeing over the last many years when estimates would actually be moving in the opposite direction. To be fair, the revisions trend had stabilized in the preceding quarters as well, with estimates for 2017 Q4 essentially remaining unchanged in the three months ahead of the start of that reporting cycle.A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts, but that isn’t the only reason, as you can see in the revisions trend for revenues in the chart below.We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond. Estimates for Q2 went up as well, as they did for the following quarters, when the same was happening to 2018 Q1 estimates. As of today, total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +17.8% from the same period the year before on +7% higher revenues.The chart below shows 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in Q2 and continue in the following quarters.As you can imagine, expectations for full-year 2018 are for an impressive showing, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up by +21% from the year-earlier level on +6.8% higher revenues. If achieved, this will be the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.The table below shows the summary picture for 2018 Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period.Standout SectorsAs you can see, the Energy sector remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +65.7% from the year-earlier period on +15.4% higher revenues. But growth for the quarter would still be in double-digits even on an ex-Energy basis (last row in the table above).What is driving the strong Q1 growth isn’t the Energy sector, but rather the breadth of growth across all sectors, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 out of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance.For the Technology sector, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +19.5% on +11.4% higher revenues, which would follow the sector’s impressive +24.2% earnings growth on +11.5% higher revenue growth.The Finance sector, which sat out the preceding quarter with an essentially flat showing, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +18.7% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues.Driving the Finance sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond is the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and an improved domestic growth environment. Finance sector’s earnings were only up +1% in full-year 2017 and in low single digits in the three years prior to that, but are on expected to be up an impressive +25.3% in full-year 2018.The Technology sector, on the other hand, has already been on stronger ground, with full-year 2017 earnings for the sector up +10.7% and expected to be up +22.4% in 2018. The enterprise spending environment was expected to improve this year even before the tax cuts, with the tax windfall expected to give a much needed boost to those trends. On top of these we have the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data that are expected to remain growth areas in the space.Please note that Technology and Finance aren’t just any two sectors out of the 16 in the S&P 500 index; these two sectors combined are the twin pillars of index’s total profitability, bringing in more than 40% of the index’s total earnings this year. The Energy sector’s outlook has improved, but the sector simply lacks the heft of these two. The Energy sector is expected to bring in about 5% of the index’s total earnings this year.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

20,AZO,"After three consecutive days of gains, benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments renewed concerns over increase in the pace of rate hikes. Powell in his speech to Congress indicated that the U.S. economy is strengthening and signaled that the key rate might be increased at a gradual pace. However, investors fretted that the central bank’s move to stop the economy from overheating might lead to not just three but even four more rate increases this year. How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.2%, or 300.96 points, to close at 25,410.03. The S&P 500 fell 1.3% to close at 2,744.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.35, losing 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 17.7% to close at 18.59. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles as Rate Hike Fears LoomIn his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell presented an encouraging picture of the U.S economy. Powell expressed confidence that the coming few years will be “good years for the economy”. After all, Americans are willing to spend more and business houses have ramped up their investments, helping to boost productivity.Consequently, traders predicted that an upbeat economy will fuel inflation further and prompt the Fed to step in and hike rates at a faster pace.  Many of them are already predicting the Fed will increase rates four times instead of three. According to data from the CME Group, odds of four rate hikes by year-end rose to 33% on Tuesday from about 20% on Monday.For the time being, Powell maintained that the Fed would keep to its plan of hiking rates three times this year. But, he did mention that “we’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target”.Following a three-day long rally, all the key U.S. indexes declined as investors remained wary of an increase in the pace of rate hikes. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their worst daily performance in percentage terms since Feb 8. The Dow registered a slump of more than 300 points. For the S&P 500 index, all the 11 sectors finished in the red, with the real estate and consumer discretionary sectors emerging as the biggest drags on the S&P 500.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 2.14%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (REIT) (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively.Additionally, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) decreased 2.12%, which was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Its key components like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) declined 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Both the retailers have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

24,AZO,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because AutoZone is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AZO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $9.06 per share for AZO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.81 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AZO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.87% heading into earnings season.AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AZO has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for AutoZone, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

25,AZO,"AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 10, 2018) results on Feb 27, before the market opens.The company’s earnings grew 6.8% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate last quarter. AutoZone delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 1% for the trailing four quarters. AutoZone has a long-term growth rate of 13.2%.In the last three months, AutoZone’s shares have outperformed the industry. The shares have gained 12.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AutoZone, Inc. Quote A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of AutoZone beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are high. This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for AutoZone is +3.95%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $9.16 and $8.82, respectively.Zacks Rank: AutoZone carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?AutoZone utilizes cash flow for opening new stores every year and they also aggressively repurchase shares. During first-quarter 2018, AutoZone opened 16 new stores, relocated one and closed another in the United States. The company also opened five new stores in Mexico. As of Nov 18, 2017, the company had 5,480 stores across 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 529 in Mexico; 26 Interamerican Motor Corp. branches and 14 stores in Brazil. The total store count was 6,049 as of the same date. Domestic store openings are likely to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This is likely to have some positive impacts on results.The company has ample liquidity to repurchase shares without compromising financial strength as well as its credit ratings. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, AutoZone repurchased 597,000 shares for $353 million, reflecting an average price of $590 per share. The company had shares worth $471 million remaining for repurchase at the end of the fiscal.

The company expects that the collaboration with the world’s largest RV rental and sales operator will provide maximum benefits of digital connectivity in the fast-growing international marketplace.Notably, Thor strives at raising market share through investments in innovative products. Given its robust financial position and advantages that it obtained from U.S. tax reform legislation, the company is likely to invest in new exciting areas. Further, the company constantly evaluates investment opportunities, aimed at lowering debt and returning more to investors. The new JV is in sync with its strategic plans.Thor will initially invest around $50 million in the JV called TH2. Subject to the fulfillment of certain customary closing conditions, the JV is anticipated to close by the end of February 2018.It is estimated that TH2 will considerably increase the enjoyment and safety of RV-users through digital connectivity. This will perk up every aspect of RV with functions like trip planning and booking, roadside assistance, remote systems monitoring, campsite rental and peer-to-peer RV. Manufacturers, rental operators and RV dealers, who utilize TH2’s services and products, will experience enhanced efficiencies with respect to product pricing, fleet management and service engagement.

27,AZO,"Chico’s FAS (CHS  -  Free Report) is slated to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 28, before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this specialty retailer of designer apparel and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Chico’s missed the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters. However, it posted an average positive surprise of 31.3%.Chico's FAS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Chico's FAS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chico's FAS, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 8 cents, reflecting a year- over-year decline of 20%. Notably, the consensus estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $565.7 million, down 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayOf late, Chico’s has been gaining on strategic initiatives to better serve customers and transform business. Also, the company remains on track with its cost control and operating efficiency endeavors, which are reaping benefits. The company expects to achieve annualized savings of $100-$110 million by mid-2018. In this regard, it achieved savings worth more than $100 million as of November 2017 and sees significant opportunities in fiscal 2018. The company anticipates saving on merchandise margins in fiscal 2018 through its sourcing initiatives and SG&A savings.Also, Chico’s anticipates benefiting from the recent tax cut as a lower tax burden is likely to help it to channelize the surplus funds in the best possible manner. For fiscal 2018, the company expects its tax rate in the range of 26-28% versus a tax rate of roughly 38%, projected earlier.However, the company’s recently revised comparable store sales (comps) view for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 reflecting weakness in the quarter. It now expects total comparable sales (comps) to decrease in the band of 5-7% versus earlier projection of high single-digits decline.Meanwhile, Chico’s continues to expect gross margin of roughly flat to slightly up. SG&A expenses are now projected to be nearly flat year over year. Earlier, management anticipated SG&A expenses to decline compared with last year.Though the company’s strategic initiatives and the benefits from tax reform are likely to aid results, we remain skeptical of the upcoming results due to the soft comps and increased expense view. Additionally, the company’s dismal top- and bottom-line trends in the past quarters keep us on the sidelines.In the past six months, shares of Chico’s have rallied 21.1% underperforming the industry’s gain of 31.7%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Chico's is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

29,AZO,"Without a doubt, days like yesterday and for that matter, the past week or so can be very unsettling for any investor.  The key is to have an investing plan and a source for solid investment ideas. These two simple rules will allow for intelligent additions to one’s personal portfolio during times of market tumult.  Zacks Rank #1 stocks provides a great tool set for an investor to make those intelligent additions.  I believe you should spread your investments amongst sectors and use times like these to add quality companies who have been rated #1 by Zacks. I have 4 stocks today that fit that bill and would add to portfolios at or near today’s closing prices. If you were so inclined, I would suggest buying a half position in these names and add the other half 5-10% lower from here in case the selling isn’t over. Hang in there, the stock market will stabilize as the move higher in rates decelerates and Zacks Rank #1 stocks will improve your portfolio’s performance.  Remember, the market at various times gives investors the opportunity to pick up solid stocks at advantageous valuations, this very well may be one of those times!(LM  -  Free Report) $37.79: Legg Mason is a Baltimore based investment manager with nearly $790 billion under management.  LM provides a breadth of services including asset management, securities brokerage and investment banking.  The stock is trading at a slight discount to its industry peers and a solid discount to the S&P.  The stock yields a solid 2.8% dividend and closed today near the lower part of its 52 week range, which should provide a nice entry point for investors. Earnings estimates are heading higher with a 28.4% upward revision to the current fiscal year.  The company’s acquisitions over the past few years should propel top line revenues.  All in all, this solid financial with a Zacks #1 rank, improving earnings estimates and a higher interest rate environment should prove to be a solid addition to the portfolio.  (STX  -  Free Report) $47.44: Seagate Technology is a Computer and Technology company whose main business is storage devices.  Seagate’s latest deal with Toshiba will help it better compete with Western Digital in the hard disk drives (HDD) arena.  The company is expecting higher revenues and increased margins as it improves operational efficiencies.  With the stock close today, the price is about 10% above the midpoint for its 52 week range. The stock sports a very healthy 5% dividend yield and very importantly, earnings estimates include a 21.2% upward revision for this fiscal year.  On a valuation basis, the stock trades cheaper relative to its industry group and versus the S&P as well.  This technology stock with a Zacks #1 rank trading at these levels is worthy of being added to portfolios.  (AZO  -  Free Report) $718.57: AutoZone, the company that even Amazon can’t destroy!  This stock was on a wild ride of its own long before this recent market sell off.  Many analysts on the street had begun to talk about Amazon intruding on the turf of this automotive parts supplier but AZO has proven to have an incredible mote, tremendous management and very strong cash flows.  As the average car age begins to push toward 11.5 years old, the demand for AZO’s parts and services increases as well.  Earnings estimates are rising to the tune of 6.64% for the current fiscal year and again, this stock trades at a discount to its peer group and the S&P.And although AZO does not pay a dividend the company uses its prodigious cash flow to purchase its own shares amounting to nearly $353m in the fiscal first quarter at an average price of $590, well above today’s closing price.  In addition to the shares purchased already, the company had nearly $471m of dry powder at the end of the quarter for further repurchasing.  Although AZO is only off its 52 week range by about 10%, a purchase near these prices could provide a nice lift to your portfolio.(HUBB  -  Free Report) $129.65: Hubbell designs, manufactures and sells electrical and electronic products to various industrial and commercial markets.  The company enjoys not only a Zacks #1 rank but also is #1 in the Zack’s Industry Rank.  Earnings estimates for the current fiscal year are trending 16.5% higher and the stock trades at an industry valuation along with its Manufacturing peers.  The stock closed today at nearly the exact midpoint of its 52 week range and you receive a healthy 2.32% dividend yield while you wait out the stock’s move higher.  Year to date the stock is down 1.88% while the average manufacturing stock is down approximately 7% so a nice relative out performance for a very strong stock. Hubbell could also benefit mightily if there were to be a meaningful infrastructure bill passed by the US Congress this year.  Hubbell could well prove to be a good building block for your portfolio, especially at these prices.The markets are convulsing and gyrating not due to economic fundamentals and solid corporate earnings but rather because of mechanical adjustments being made to global portfolios.  The move higher in rates will abate soon enough and the inventory of short volatility hedging will run its course as well.  Have your game plan, include solid additions to the portfolio like the Zacks #1 ranked stocks above and in time, these turbulent market periods will subside.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

30,AZO,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 21, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.29%. In fact, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.96%.Cracker Barrel’s continual expansion plans along with various seasonal promotions are likely to boost the top line. The consensus estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $720.10 million, reflecting a 1.4% year-over-year increase.However, a challenging restaurant environment has put Cracker Barrel’s sales under pressure. Evidently, the company witnessed a decline in comparable store restaurant sales in the last two quarters, after posting 11 consecutive quarters of positive comps. Also, Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been under pressure over the last few quarters, given the challenges faced by the retail industry, as a whole. Continued soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might affect fiscal first-quarter results as well.Yet, efforts to boost comps via increased focus onoff-premise business, improving guest experience, menu innovation and excellent operational execution are expected to drive comps in the quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate expects comparable store restaurant sales and retail sales to remain flat in the quarter to be reported.Meanwhile, despite the cost-saving initiatives, higher labor costs, expenses for opening new units along with significant investments in sales-building initiatives are likely to bring down profits.Notably, management expects earnings per share in the fiscal first quarter in the range of $1.85 to $1.95. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.92, reflecting a 4.3% year-over-year decline.In addition to weak comps and higher costs, the recent Harvey and Irma hurricanes are likely to impact results.Also, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cracker Barrel is likely to beat earnings in the first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Cracker Barrel has an Earnings ESP of -0.95%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cracker Barrel currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.

If the separation at all happens, it would take around a year.While one entity would focus on passive safety, which includes equipment such as airbags and seatbelts, the other would concentrate on automotive radars and cameras with driver-assist systems, which are used in autonomous-driving technology (read more: Autoliv Stock Soars on Electronics Segment Split-Off Plan).Currently, Autoliv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The last few days saw auto giants General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford and Volkswagen AG facing recalls again.Reportedly, General Motors will be recalling more than 2.5 million vehicles in China. The issue stemmed from concerns over faulty airbags manufactured by Takata. This is indeed a serious blow to the U.S. automaker, which will start withdrawing faulty vehicles from next month. Ford has reportedly come closer to recalling SUV models in the United States. Reports of leakage in exhaust fumes were responsible for this development.Last week, German automaker Volkswagen announced that along with Chinese joint-venture partners, it will recall 4.86 million vehicles in China. Once again, the reason was faulty air bags supplied by Takata.The instances of recalls in China, the largest car market in the world, can be damaging for these automakers. At a time when these automakers are investing open-handedly on electric vehicles, these recalls are doing no good to them (read more: Recalls Plague Automakers: General Motors, Ford in Focus).5.    Copart reported adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents.

36,AZO,"AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Aug 26, 2017) results on Sep 19, before the market opens.The company earnings grew year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate last quarter. AutoZone delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 1.5% in the trailing four quarters. AutoZone has a long-term growth rate of 11.7%.AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AutoZone, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteLast month, AutoZone shares have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company shares have gained 10.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that AutoZone is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and AutoZone has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $15.26 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.11, is +0.98%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: AutoZone’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this time around.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?AutoZone utilizes cash flow for opening new stores every year and aggressively repurchases shares. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, AutoZone opened 84 stores in the United States, 16 stores in Mexico and one in Brazil. Additionally, it relocated four stores in the United States. The company plans to open another 70 domestic stores in the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely to have some positive impact on fourth-quarter 2017 results.The company has ample liquidity to repurchase shares without compromising financial strength and therefore, its credit ratings. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, AutoZone bought back 396,000 shares for $284 million at an average price of $716 per share. It had shares worth $1.05 billion to be repurchased at the end of the quarter.

37,AZO,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, AutoZone has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, AutoZone's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that AutoZone has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AutoZone stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, AutoZone P/CF ratio of 9.8 is lower than the broader industry average of 6.4, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, AutoZone currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AutoZone a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though AutoZone might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A. This gives AZO a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable. Both the current quarter and full year have seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to no movement in the opposite direction.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dropped 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:AutoZone, Inc. Price and Consensus  AutoZone, Inc. Price and Consensus | AutoZone, Inc. QuoteThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAutoZone is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 27% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

40,AZO,"Earnings Preview 2/27/12
"
41,AZO,"Earnings season will be still going on this week, with 376 firms scheduled to report, and 24 of those will be members of the S&P 500.  By the end of the week we will be over 95% done with earnings season.
"
42,AZO,"Many large and significant companies will be reporting this week.  They include: AutoZone 
"
43,AZO,"(AZO  -  Free Report),  Big Lots 
"
44,AZO,"(BIG  -  Free Report), Costco

"
49,AZO,"(LOW) and Priceline 
"
50,AZO,"(PCLN).
"
51,AZO,"It will also be a busy week for economic data.  Key reports include Durable Goods, Personal Income and Spending, The ISM Manufacturing Index, Auto Sales and the second look at fourth quarter GDP.Monday
"
52,AZO,"Pending Home sales are expected to rise by 1.0% after falling by 3.5% last month.  Given the increase in the number of deals that fall through due to low appraisals or mortgages not being approved, this has been a less consistent indicator of future existing home sales than it used to be.  Tuesday
"
53,AZO,"New orders for Durable Goods are expected to drop by 1.4% after rising 3.0% in December.  Some of the decline will be from the very volatile transportation equipment sector, where a few Jetliner orders can really skew the results.  Excluding transportation equipment, orders are expected to rise by just 0.2% after being up 2.2% last month.  This data is often revised significantly, so keep an eye on what happened to the December numbers, not just January.
"
54,AZO,"The Case Schiller Home Price Index is expected to show a year-over-year decline of 3.6% versus a 3.7% drop last month.  This is among the slowest of economic data to be released, as these will be December numbers, and actually a weighted three-month average of October, November and December.  Given the decline in used home inventories, I am expecting the decline in housing prices to be just about over by now, but even if I’m right we really will not see it in the Case Schiller index for another month or so.
"
55,AZO,"The Consumer Confidence Index is expected to rise to 62.5 from 61.1 last month.  While improving, it is still at a low level.  This is to my mind a highly overrated economic indicator, since what consumers actually do is often at odd with what they say in these surveys. Still, better to see it going up than down.Wednesday

56,AZO,"We get the second look at GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  The consensus is looking for it to be unrevised at 2.8%, up from 1.8% in the third quarter, although of much lower quality than in the third quarter.  The low-quality was since much of the growth came from inventory additions.  Given the revisions to other data, particularly Industrial Production for November and December, I am expecting a slight upward revision to the fourth quarter number.   
"
57,AZO,"The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index is expected to dip to 60.0 from 60.2 in January.  Since any reading over 50 indicates expansion, this would still indicate healthy growth in manufacturing activity in the Great Lakes region, but slightly slower than last month.
"
58,AZO,"The Federal Reserve releases its “Beige Book,” a collection of mostly anecdotal information from each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.  I suspect that the overall tone of the book will be more upbeat than recent editions, most likely pointing to a pickup in growth while inflation remains well contained.Thursday
"
59,AZO,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance were unchanged at 351,000 last week (well, the prior week was revised up from 348,000).  The consensus is looking for a slight rebound to 355,000.  The drop in weekly claims well below the key 400,000 level was the first clue that the jobs situation was getting significantly better.  If these numbers fall again it would be a powerful sign that the momentum is continuing.  The big seasonal adjustments are all in the rearview mirror, so last week’s level is probably about right, but we have recently seen a lot of volatility in the weekly numbers.  Thus the four-week average is the thing to focus on.(at 359,000 last week).  We are actually now well below the average level of claims for the last 35 years.  Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
60,AZO,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 53,000 to 3.392 million. That is down 460,000, or 11.9% from a year ago. The consensus is looking for a bounce to 3.425 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 60,000 to 3.402 million last week and are down 1.045 million, or 23.5% over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 7.503 million. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.659 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end at the start of March. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
61,AZO,"Personal Income is expected to rise by 0.4% down from an increase of 0.5% in December.  This is a very broad measure of income.  Over the last year or so, personal income has been rising, but not much of that growth has come from wages and salaries.  Dividend and small business income on the other had have been very robust.  This is a report where the details are as important as the overall number.  Personal Spending is expected to rise by 0.3% after having been unchanged in December.  With income rising more than spending, the Savings rate will rise from the 4.0% rate of last month.  While a higher savings rate is needed over the long term, a rise in the savings rate tends to slow the economy.
"
62,AZO,"The Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Core Personal Consumption expenditure index is expected to rise by 0.2%m the same rate it rose in December.
"
63,AZO,"The ISM manufacturing index is expected to rise to 54.5 from 53.1.  This is a “magic 50” index, so any reading over 50 means that the manufacturing sector is expanding.  The expected level is quite healthy, but not exactly booming.  The overall index is made up of 10 sub indexes.  I consider four of them to be particularly significant: Production, New Orders, Backlog and Employment.  They are as important as the overall index is.
"
64,AZO,"Construction spending is expected to rise by 1.0% in February on top of a 1.5% rise in December.  Private construction spending is likely to increase more than Public spending.Friday
"
65,AZO,"Nothing of particular significance.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
66,AZO,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

74,AZO,"AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) continues to trade near its all-time high, jumping higher on another strong quarter from late September. With a high industry rank and bullish growth projection, this Zacks #1 Rank stock is primed for momentum.
"
75,AZO,"Company Description
"
76,AZO,"AutoZone, Inc. operates as a retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. The company was founded in 1979 and has a market cap of $12.7 billion.
"
77,AZO,"AutoZone has been a top performer over the last few years, hitting a series of new highs as its business continues to grow. That trend was on display in late September with strong Q3 results that came in ahead of expectations.
"
78,AZO,"Third-Quarter Results
"
79,AZO,"Revenue for the period was up 8% from last year to $2.6 billion. Earnings also came in strong at $7.18, 3% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
"
80,AZO,"The good quarter was driven by strong domestic same-store sales, up 4.5% from last year. Margins were also on the upswing, with gross profit climbing to 51.2% from 50.5%.
"
81,AZO,"Estimates
"
82,AZO,"We saw some decent movement in estimates off the good quarter, with the current year adding 35 cents to $12.55 while the next-year estimate tacked on 93 cents to $25.87, a bullish 15% growth projection.
"
83,AZO,"Valuation
"
84,AZO,"But in spite of the gains, the valuation picture still looks solid, with a PEG ratio of .93 below the benchmark of 1 for value. 
"
85,AZO,"2-Year Chart
"
86,AZO,"On the chart, shares have been charging higher for the last two years, hitting a series of new highs in the process. Look for support from the long-term trend on any weakness. Take a look below.
"

"
88,AZO,"Total Retail Sales rose 0.5% in October on top of a 1.1% rise in September. Relative to a year ago they are up 7.2%. While the number is not adjusted for inflation (it is, but only for seasonality and holidays) it is still a strong showing. It was also better than the expected rise of 0.4% for the month.
"
89,AZO,"Retail sales is a very broad measure of consumer spending, not just what is going on at the shopping malls. What happens on the car lots can make a big difference. That said, excluding autos sales, they were up 0.6% for the month after rising 0.5% in September (revised down from up 0.6%) and are up 7.3% year over year.
"
90,AZO,"The ex-autos number was much better than the expected rise of just 0.2%. Sales of autos and parts dealers such as AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) rose 0.5%, but that is after a massive 4.2% surge last month. On a year-over-year basis, sales are up 7.0%.More Pain at the Pump?
"
91,AZO,"For most of past year, the rise in retail sales has been led by something that is not really good news: higher sales at gas stations. Remember, this data is not adjusted for inflation, and the actual consumption of gasoline is down year over year. It wass all about higher prices at the pump. That was not true this time around, as gas station sales fell 0.4% -- partially reversing a 0.7% rise in September.
"
92,AZO,"However over the last year, sales at the gas stations are up 15.6%, more than double the overall rise in retail sales. That suggests that headline CPI might be lower than core inflation when it is released tomorrow, except for one thing: sales at grocery stores were up 1.1% after falling 0.2% last month, but year over year are slightly below the overall level of retail sales, with a 6.6% rise. I suppose it is possible that in September everyone was eating hot dogs off the rollers at the gas station instead of cooking at home, and for some reason that reversed this month, but I doubt it.
"
93,AZO,"People more or less have to spend money on food and fuel, and thus changes in sales tend to reflect changes in prices more than changes in volumes sold. The strong monthly sales at grocery stores is obviously good news for firms like Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report).
"
94,AZO,"In gauging the health of the economy and the real mood of the consumer (as opposed to the consumer sentiment and confidence surveys), it is worth looking at how the more discretionary areas of retail sales are doing. It is much easier to put off the purchase of a new sofa or washing machine than it is to put off going to the grocery store, or refill the tank when you are running on fumes.Discretionary Retail
"
95,AZO,"The more discretionary categories were mixed, as they were last month, but those that did well last month were soft this month, and vice versa. Furniture is perhaps the most discretionary of all the categories. It showed a 0.7% drop on the month, but that was after a 1.2% rise in September.
"
96,AZO,"The story at electronics and appliance stores, like Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) was diametrically opposite, with a 3.7% surge in October versus a decline of 0.3% in September. On a year-over-year basis, though, both are at the weak end, with furniture up 3.4% and electronics up 3.7%.
"
97,AZO,"Electronics is a bit of a special category, however, since prices of electronic gear tend to fall over time. Sales at sporting goods and hobby stores, such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), were strong for the second month in a row -- rising 1.3% after a 0.9% rise in September and are up 9.1% year over year.
"
98,AZO,"Clothing is just a bit less discretionary than sporting goods, but you can still defer purchase of a new pair of jeans if times are really tough. Those sales were down 0.7% after a 1.7% rise in September. Year over year, sales are up 5.8%. Building materials stores such as Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) saw a 1.5% surge on the month after rising only 0.1% in September, and are up 5.6% year over year.Other Retail Areas
"
99,AZO,"Sales at drug stores like Walgreens (WAG) were up a strong 0.7% on the month, but this is after being unchanged in September and over the last year up just 4.4%. Those sales are in the non-discretionary camp, along with sales at grocery stores.
"
100,AZO,"Aside from gas stations, the strongest year over year sales gains have come from the non-store retailers, such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), with a 11.1% rise. They surged this month by 1.5% after a rise of just 0.3% in September.Report Card: A-/B+
"
101,AZO,"Overall I would have to rate this as a very good report. It was much better than expected when one strips out autos sales, and nine of the 13 types of stores saw increases on the month. While that is down from ten of 13 up in September, it still represents broad-based increases in retail sales.
"
102,AZO,"Year over year, all 13 types of stores are showing increases. The smallest year-over-year increase is the 3.4% rise at furniture stores. With core inflation running below 2.0%, that means that the consumer is buying more stuff pretty much across the board. Since the consumer is such a huge part of the overall economy (71%), this suggests that we will see relatively strong economic growth in the fourth quarter, at least along the lines of the 2.5% growth we saw in the third quarter.
"
103,AZO,"Some of that seems to be based on a declining savings rate, as income gains have not been keeping up with spending gains. One does have to question the sustainability of the retail sales gains into next year unless we star to see a pickup in employment and/or wage and salary gains. However, for the time being things are looking pretty good.RELATED ARTICLESNews in U.S. Still Better than Europe3Q Earnings Good, Not GreatS&P 500 Strength: Hold or Fold?

104,AZO,"Earnings Preview 9/16/11
"
105,AZO,"The second quarter earnings season is over. Now we are starting to see a few companies report their third-quarter results (period ending in August September or October). Just a trickle so far, but those might provide some clues as to how well the rest of the market will fare in the upcoming earnings season.
"
106,AZO,"There will be just 36 firms reporting, but 14 of those are in the S&P 500, including Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Carnival Cruise (CCL  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). That is an interesting cross-section of the market which may well provide some interesting insights.
"
107,AZO,"It will be a light week for economic data. The main focus of the official numbers will be on Housing, starting with the home builders index, followed by housing starts and building permits and finally existing home sales. The Fed is holding a meeting, but there will be no change in the Fed Funds rate. The language of their statement might provide clues about the potential for further unconventional easing steps that they might take.
"
108,AZO,"With few earnings and little data outside of housing, the focus of the market will likely continue to be on the other side of the Atlantic and the ongoing Greek drama....MondayThe National Association of Homebuilders Index is likely to remain unchanged at 15, which is a simply abysmal reading. This is a magic 50 index, so any reading below 50 indicates a poor outlook for the homebuilders.TuesdayThe Data on Housing Starts and Building Permits will provide the reason for the pessimism among the homebuilders. In July, housing starts were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 604,000. They are expected to decline still further to just 592,000 (I’ll take the under on that one). That is down from over 2.2 million at the height of the bubble. It used to be a rarity for housing starts to be below 1 million, but August will mark the 33rd consecutive month where starts have been below 1 million.The best leading indicator for housing starts is building permits. They ran at 597,000 in July and are also expected to be effectively unchanged rising to 598,000 (I’ll also take the under). The bubble peak was also over 2.2 million. Traditionally homebuilding has been the sector that has led us out of recessions. That locomotive is derailed and does not appear likely to get back on track anytime soon.WednesdayAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve Board, even though everyone knows that the Fed Funds rate will remain in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been stuck in since December 2008. The Fed has pledged to keep it there until the middle of 2013. The Fed is deeply divided on if they should do more to try to support the economy by taking unconventional steps to further ease monetary policy, and the meeting was expanded to two days so they can hash things out. The language of the statement will be carefully parsed to see it they have come to any agreement. Last time there was a highly unusual three dissents to the statement. Watch to see if that changes.Existing home sales were running at an annual pace of 4.67 million in July. Very little change is expected, with the consensus looking for a slight increase to a 4.70 million rate. Since the sale of an existing home is simply the transfer of an existing asset, it generates very little economic activity (aside from realtor’s commissions). However, since people do tend to redecorate “new for them homes there is some activity that is generated. Still, the impact pales in comparison to new home sales, even though new home sales are just a small fraction of used home sales. The important thing in the report is the level of sales relative to inventory, or the months of supply on the market. That gives a very good clue as to the future direction of existing home prices. Housing equity is (or at least used to be) a vital repository of the wealth of the middle class. Since housing tends to be a very leveraged asset, relatively small changes in price can have a big impact on wealth. Also, being “underwater on a mortgage is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a foreclosure to happen. Six months supply is considered normal, and during the bubble, four months was the norm. In July it climbed to 9.4 months from 8.2 months in June, indicating continued downward pressure on housing prices.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in they year, but have been recently in a trading range above 400,000. Last week they increased by 11,000 to 428,000. I would expect a small decline this week, but nothing big enough to really change the story of very weak job growth. The consensus is looking for 417,000. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The four-week moving average will stay above the 400,000 level, and might top 420,000. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for June. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing claims have in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 12,000 to 3.726 million. That is down 765,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.730 million, a very small increase.  Some (most?) of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 10,000 last week to 3.608 million, but are down 1.352 million over the last year. Even extended benefits don’t last forever. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.144 million, which is down 25,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.066 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed (unlikely given the current Congress) then all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayNothing of particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceACCURAY INC     ARAY       201106 ($0.41) $0.08  -75 20110919 AMC $5.26 LENNAR CORP -A  LEN        201108 $0.11  $0.16  75 20110919 BTO $13.85 ADOBE SYSTEMS   ADBE       201108 $0.44  $0.44  -4.76 20110920 AMC $26.12 ANALOGIC CORP   ALOG       201107 $0.44  $0.56  -9.3 20110920 AMC $45.98 AUTOZONE INC    AZO        201108 $6.97  $5.66  9.91 20110920 BTO $325.77 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201108 $1.63  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.32 CARNIVAL PLC    CUK        201108 $1.62  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.17 CONAGRA FOODS   CAG        201108 $0.31  $0.34  -2.08 20110920 BTO $23.63 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201108 $0.95  $0.82  0 20110920 BTO $87.64 FULL CIRCLE CAP FULL       201106 $0.21  $0.24  0 20110920 AMC $6.96 GENTIUM SPA-ADR GENT       201106 $0.14  $0.21  7.14 20110920 BTO $6.52 JEFFERIES GP-NW JEF        201108 $0.23  $999.00  -4.88 20110920 BTO $14.91 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201108 $0.44  $0.39  5.8 20110920 AMC $28.95 AMER SUPERCON   AMSC       201106 ($0.08) $0.28  22.22 20110921 BTO $6.01 BED BATH&BEYOND BBBY       201108 $0.84  $0.70  16.13 20110921 AMC $59.36 COPART INC      CPRT       201107 $0.59  $0.43  1.43 20110921 AMC $41.23 FULLER(HB) CO   FUL        201108 $0.47  $0.38  8.7 20110921 AMC $21.03 GENL MILLS      GIS        201108 $0.62  $0.64  0 20110921 BTO $37.80 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201108 $0.33  $0.23  15.38 20110921 AMC $18.11 IHS INC-A       IHS        201108 $0.55  $0.62  1.59 20110921 BTO $79.37 RED HAT INC     RHT        201108 $0.19  $0.14  6.25 20110921 AMC $41.24 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201108 $0.17  $0.08  100 20110921 AMC $7.56 TEXAS INDS      TXI        201108 ($0.26) ($0.20) -119.23 20110921 AMC $38.77 CARMAX GP (CC)  KMX        201108 $0.51  $0.48  17.02 20110922 BTO $28.54 CINTAS CORP     CTAS       201108 $0.47  $0.40  11.36 20110922 AMC $31.59 COMTECH TELECOM CMTL       201107 $0.36  $0.73  20.51 20110922 AMC $28.17 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201108 $0.87  $0.47  51.39 20110922 BTO $26.19 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201108 $1.48  $1.20  1.74 20110922 BTO $77.08 FINISH LINE-CLA FINL       201108 $0.38  $0.31  0 20110922 AMC $20.50 NIKE INC-B      NKE        201108 $1.21  $1.14  6.9 20110922 AMC $88.04 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201108 ($0.18) ($0.18) 50 20110922 BTO $1.10 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201108 ($1.03) ($0.95) 17.11 20110922 BTO $27.08 SYNTHESIS ENRGY SYMX       201106 ($0.04) ($0.08) 36.36 20110922 BTO $1.60 TIBCO SOFTWARE  TIBX       201108 $0.16  $0.14  7.69 20110922 AMC $22.30 VAIL RESORTS    MTN        201107 ($1.50) ($1.16) 3.69 20110922 BTO $38.31 KB HOME         KBH        201108 ($0.17) ($0.02) -75 20110923 BTO $6.27

109,AZO,"Retail and food service sales were unchanged in August, below expectations of a 0.2% increase. July was revised down from an increase of 0.5% to an increase of 0.3%. Total retail sales are up 7.2% from a year ago.
"
110,AZO,"This was a disappointing report, and shows the consumer is still quite cautious. This year, ""back to school"" did not mean ""back to the mall."" The Retail Sales report covers far more than just the malls, however, and is a very broad-based measure of consumer spending.
"
111,AZO,"Since consumer spending makes up 70% of the economy, it is a very important number. That overstates things a bit since retail sales are mostly about the sale of goods, not services, and services make up two thirds of what consumers spend. Still, it is a pretty important thing to watch.Beneath the Headline Numbers
"
112,AZO,"Auto (and parts) sales were down 0.3%, down from a 0.2% gain in July (revised down from a 0.7% increase). On a year-over-year basis they were up a solid 6.4%. That figure includes sales at parts dealers like AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) as well as the dealers like CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report).
"
113,AZO,"Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.1%, below expectations for a 0.3% increase. Year over year, sales are up 7.3%. The year-over-year numbers are pretty robust, but keep in mind that these numbers are not adjusted for price changes, so part of the year-over-year gains simply reflect inflation. However, outside of food and energy, inflation is very tame, on a year-over-year basis.
"
114,AZO,"Of the thirteen types of stores tracked in the report, eight were up on a month-to-month basis, with five down. The sales weakness was concentrated in many of the more discretionary types of retail sales. Last month, nine were up and four down on the month.A Look at Stores of All Types
"
115,AZO,"Year over year, all types of stores are showing increases, ranging from 0.2% (Furniture stores) to 20.8% for gas stations. Clearly, gas prices were the major factor in the increased sales at the corner Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report) station, not a sudden rise in the number of 44oz. fountain drinks being consumed. Actually, the evidence suggests that the volume of gasoline sold is actually declining slightly in response to higher prices, and moves to increase the fuel efficiency of the country’s auto fleet.
"
116,AZO,"Aside from the gas stations, which are clearly a special case, the next strongest group on a year-over-year basis was the non-store retailers, the group that includes the catalog and Internet retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). They are up 10.4% year over year. Since sales taxes are generally not paid on internet or catalog sales, the relative strength in non-store retailers is one of the factors that is putting strains on state and local government revenues. As noted above, the auto dealers and parts stores were up 7.3% year over year.  
"
117,AZO,"The best performers on the month were the sporting goods and hobby stores, where sales rebounded 2.4%, reversing a 1.1% slide in July. This was the one discretionary type of store to show strength. Year-over-year sales at places like Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) are up 7.1%.
"
118,AZO,"The next best category of retailers for the month were the non-store retailers, up 0.5% on top of a 0.3% rise in July. That was matched by the Electronics and Appliance stores, which also gained 0.5% on top of a 1.2% gain in July. However, year over year this was one of the weakest groups, with just a 1.5% gain.
"
119,AZO,"The retail sales figures are adjusted for seasonal factors, such as the number of selling days in the month, but they are not adjusted for inflation. Electronics is one area that perpetually sees falling prices. This rebound is probably temporary, reflecting the weakness earlier this year. 
"
120,AZO,"The weakest area was the miscellaneous retailers, which by their very nature are hard to categorize, or fit into any larger economic trends. There sales dropped a sharp 2.2%, reversing most of last month’s 2.4% gain. Year-over-year, though, sales are up a solid 7.1%. Clothing stores like The Gap (GPS) were weak, with a drop of 0.7% on top of a 0.3% decline in July.""Back to School"" a Bust
"
121,AZO,"It looks like the ""back to school"" season, the second-most important part of the year for those retailers, was a bust. Relative to a year ago they are up 5.6%, which is a bit below average. A new pair of jeans is a bit less discretionary than a new kitchen table, but less discretionary than going to the grocery store.
"
122,AZO,"General merchandise stores, a category that includes the department stores, saw a 0.1% increase after rising 0.4% in July. Year over year, general merchandise sales are up 3.8%, so sales are generally on the soft side at the mall anchors than in the stores in the periphery of the mall.
"
123,AZO,"Going out to eat and drink is also a very discretionary item, and sales at bars and restaurants were down 0.3% in August, on top of a 0.4% decline in July. Year over year, sales are up just 3.9%. The two most non discretionary areas showed small increases.
"
124,AZO,"Food and beverage stores (including grocery stores) posted a 0.2% increase for the month, on top of a 0.5% rise in July, and are up 6.4% year over year. Some of that increase is due to higher food costs. Health care stores -- mostly drug stores like Walgreen’s (WAG) -- saw a 0.2% increase in August on top of a 0.5% increase in July, but are up just 3.5% year over year.
"
125,AZO,"Weak Report, Below Expectations
"
126,AZO,"Overall, I have to call this a weak report. It was well below expectations, and the more discretionary types of stores, such as furniture and clothing, were among the weak areas. That indicates that consumers are very cautious.
"
127,AZO,"These are August numbers, and thus probably reflect the concerns over the debt-ceiling showdown, and the subsequent weakness in the stock market. Since the top 20% of the population gets more than 50% of the total income in the country, and they are the ones who are likely to have money in the stock market, the market gyrations may have caused them to decide to just sit on their wallets.   
"
128,AZO,"Keep in mind that these numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but inflation is low and likely to remain low. The bond market is crystal clear on its view that inflation will remain low. Bond market investors, who tend to be pretty sophisticated types, are willing to lock up their money for ten years at a yield of less than 2.0%. They would have to be blithering idiots to do that if they expected inflation to seriously start to accelerate. If inflation were to average more than 2.0% for the next decade those bonds would be certificates of confiscation, not investments.
"
129,AZO,"The graph below (from this source) shows the longer-term path of retail sales, both total (blue line) and excluding sales at gas stations (red line). In both cases we are at new highs, but recall that these numbers are not adjusted for inflation. While inflation -- particularly core inflation -- is still very low, over the course of a few years it still plays a significant role.
"
130,AZO,"The pace of growth since the bottom (slope of the lines) appears to be slightly better than what prevailed prior to the Great Recession, but it was not a very fast snap-back, more like a reset to a lower level, than a continuation of the previous growth rate from a lower level. The ex-gasoline numbers are probably a better reflection of the overall state of the economy than the total numbers, but both are telling a pretty similar story.
"
131,AZO,"Things are getting better, but slowly. While this report is weak, it was not a disaster. However, if the September report is also flat or down, we will have a real reason to worry.
"
132,AZO,"The second graph (from this source) shows the year-over-year change in sales excluding gasoline, going back to 1993. While the year-over-year gain of 5.7% is down from the 8.2% pace at the start of the year, it is still very healthy, and is higher than the increases that we were running for most of the previous economic expansion -- about on par with how we were doing for most of the Clinton economic expansion.
"
133,AZO,"Core inflation was much lower than now in both of those previous expansions (these numbers strip out only the energy side, not the food side of the ex-food and energy inflation, so it is not a perfect match). That suggests that real retail sales outside of gasoline are healthy, at least on a year-over-year basis. Then again we are coming off the biggest downturn in spending in decades. That means there is a lot of pent up demand out there.RELATED ARTICLESRetail Sales DisappointLosing the War on PovertyS&P Rally to 1,240 Before Capitulation
"
134,AZO,"Retail and Food Service Sales were up 0.5% in July, in line with expectations. June was revised up from an increase of 0.1% to an increase of 0.3%. Total retail sales are up 8.5% from a year ago. In other words, reports of the consumer's death have been greatly exaggerated.
"
135,AZO,"The Retail Sales report covers far more than just the shopping malls, and is a very broad-based measure of consumer spending.

That overstates things a bit since retail sales are mostly about the sale of goods, not services, and services make up two thirds of what consumers spend. Still, it is a pretty important thing to watch.A Breakdown of Results
"
136,AZO,"Auto (and parts) sales were up 0.4%, down from a 0.7% gain in June (revised down from a 0.8% increase). On a year-over-year basis they were up a solid 8.1%. That figure includes sales at parts dealers like AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) as well as the dealers like CarMax (KMX).
"
137,AZO,"Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.5%, nicely ahead of expectations for just a 0.2% increase. Year-over-year sales are up 8.6%. The year-over-year numbers are pretty robust, but keep in mind that these numbers are not adjusted for price changes, so part of the year-over-year gains simply reflect inflation. However, outside of food and energy, inflation is very tame on a year-over-year basis.
"
138,AZO,"The growth was widespread. Of the thirteen types of stores tracked in the report, ten were up on a month-to-month basis, with only two down and one unchanged. Sales rebounded a bit in many of the more discretionary types of retail sales.
"
139,AZO,"Last month, before the revisions, eight were up and five down on the month; after the revisions, nine were up and only three were down. Year over year, all types of stores are showing increases, ranging from 0.4% (Electronics and Appliance stores) to 23.6% for Gas Stations.
"
140,AZO,"Clearly, gas prices were the major factor in the increased sales at the corner Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report) station, not a sudden rise in the number of 44oz. fountain drinks being consumed. Actually, the evidence suggests that the volume of gasoline sold is actually declining slightly in response to higher prices, and moves to increase the fuel efficiency of the country’s auto fleet.The Best Performers
"
141,AZO,"Aside from the Gas Stations, which are clearly a special case, the next strongest group on a year-over-year basis was the non-store retailers -- the group that includes the catalog and internet retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). They are up 14.1% year over year. As noted above, the Auto Dealers and Parts stores were up 8.1% year over year. Miscellaneous stores sales are up 9.4% year over year.
"
142,AZO,"The best performers on the month were the gas stations, where sales rebounded 1.6%, reversing a 1.7% slide (revised from a 1.3% decline) in June. Falling revenues at gas stations is a bad sign, not a good one. Given the recent sharp decline in oil prices, we should expect gas station sales to be down in August. Money not spent at the pump can be spent elsewhere, and much of the cash spent on gasoline flows abroad, rather than re-circulating in the economy, to pay for oil imports.
"
143,AZO,"The other part of non-core inflation, food, showed an increase of 0.5%, matching its June increase, but only after June was revised up from 0.3%. Sales at Grocery Stores (and other stores selling food and beverages, excluding restaurants) jumped by 7.8% year over year. Sales of food for the home are among the least discretionary purchases, along with gasoline.
"
144,AZO,"Spending at Health Care stores, such as Walgreen’s (WAG) also tends to be relatively stable. Sales there were up just 0.1% in July, after being unchanged in June. June, however, was originally reported as a decline of 0.2% on the month. Sales are up 4.1% year over year.Discretionary Sales Up
"
145,AZO,"Perhaps the most encouraging sign is in the highly discretionary types of retail sales. They took it on the chin in June and to a lesser extent in May, but are showing signs of rebounding.
"
146,AZO,"Sales at Electronics and Appliance stores are a good example. They jumped 1.4% on the month, but that is on the heels of a 0.1% decline (revised from -0.2%) in June. Still, year over year, sales are effectively flat, up just 0.4%. However, on the electronics side of things, prices generally decline over time, so the situation is a bit of the flip-side of what is going on at the gas stations (year over year).
"
147,AZO,"As for appliance sales, they tend to be spurred by housing sales, both new and existing, and both of those have been soft. Furniture sales are also greatly influenced by home sales. People tend to redecorate when they move into a “new for them house.
"
148,AZO,"Absent that, there are few purchases that are generally easier to put off until next month or next year than a new sofa or dining room table. Furniture sales were up 0.5% in July, reversing a 0.5% decline in June (revised from a 0.8% decline). As with electronics, the year-over-year increase is anemic, up just 1.1%.
"
149,AZO,"On the other hand, another discretionary category -- Sporting Goods and Hobby stores -- saw sales fall, with a drop of 1.5%. Last month was revised sharply upwards there to an increase of 0.2%, not a 0.7% drop. Year over year sales are up just 2.9%. This category also includes book stores, so the bankruptcy and liquidation of Borders may be distorting the numbers in this group.
"
150,AZO,"Longer term though, the switch to electronic book sales, such as on the iPad or the Amazon Kindle, pose a secular and existential treat to the book store category. Those electronic sales are mostly made by firms in the non-store retailing category. Those on-line retailers have been one of the bright spots in retailing, rising 0.9% for the month on top of a 0.4% rise in June (revised from 0.3%) and are up 14.1% from a year ago.
"
151,AZO,"Clothing stores like The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) showed solid growth, but slower than in June. They saw sales increase 0.5% in July, down from a 1.2% increase in June. However, June was revised sharply higher from the original 0.7% increase reported. Relative to a year ago they are up 7.7%, which is a bit below average. A new pair of jeans is a bit less discretionary than a new kitchen table, but less discretionary than going to the grocery store.
"
152,AZO,"General Merchandise stores, a category that includes the Department stores saw no change in July, after rising 0.5% in June. Year over year, General Merchandise sales are up 3.7%, so sales are generally on the soft side at the mall anchors than in the stores in the periphery of the mall.
"
153,AZO,"Going out to eat and drink is also a very discretionary item, and sales at bars and restaurants were up just 0.1% in July, but June showed a big upward revision, swinging to a 0.4% increase from a 0.4% decline reported last month. Year over year sales are up 5.6%.Welcome Good News
"
154,AZO,"Overall, I have to call this a strong report. Not so much for the absolute increase in July -- it was OK, but not superlative. The good news was in the upward revisions to June and the better performance of some of the more discretionary types of stores. The overall number was in line with expectations, but sales excluding Autos were much better than expected.
"
155,AZO,"The more discretionary mix was a surprise, especially in light of soft consumer confidence numbers and the soap opera that was going on in D.C. during the month. Keep in mind that these numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but inflation is low and likely to remain low.
"
156,AZO,"The bond market is crystal clear on its view that inflation will remain low. Bond market investors, who tend to be pretty sophisticated types, are willing to lock up their money for ten years at a yield of less than 2.2%. They would have to be blithering idiots to do that if they expected inflation to seriously start to accelerate. If inflation were to average more than 2.2% for the next decade those bonds would be certificates of confiscation, not investments. 
"
157,AZO,"The graph below shows the longer-term path of retail sales, both total (blue line) and excluding sales at gas stations (red line). In both cases we are at new highs, but recall that these numbers are not adjusted for inflation.
"
158,AZO,"While inflation -- particularly core inflation -- is still very low, over the course of a few years it still plays a significant role. The pace of growth since the bottom (slope of the lines) appears to be slightly better than what prevailed prior to the Great Recession, but it was not a very fast snap-back -- more like a reset to a lower level -- than a continuation of the previous growth rate from a lower level.
"
159,AZO,"The ex-gasoline numbers are probably a better reflection of the overall state of the economy than the total numbers, but both are telling a pretty similar story. Things are getting better, but slowly.
"
160,AZO,"This report is decidedly not supportive of the idea that we have already started to fall back into recession. That is highly significant because after the recent tumble in the market, it looks like the market is pricing in a recession. This report should give investors confidence to at least nibble on solid, safe firms. I don’t think it is a green light for highly speculative investments, but it is for big, well-capitalized dividend paying stocks.
"
161,AZO,"The second graph shows the year-over-year change in sales excluding gasoline going back to 1993. While the year-over-year gain of 6.9% is down from the 8.2% pace at the start of the year, it is still very healthy, and is higher than the increases that we were running for most of the previous economic expansion, and about on par with how we were doing for most of the Clinton economic expansion.
"
162,AZO,"Core inflation was much lower than now in both of those previous expansions (these numbers strip out only the energy side, not the food side of the ex-food and energy inflation, so it is not a perfect match). That suggests that real retail sales outside of gasoline are healthy, at least on a year-over-year basis. Then again, we are coming off the biggest downturn in spending in decades. That means there is a lot of pent-up demand out there.RELATED ARTICLESThe Consumer Is AliveTrade Deficit Much Worse than ExpectedInitial Jobless Claims Drop to 395K
"
163,AZO,"Retail and Food Service Sales were in line with expectations for June, coming in with an increase of 0.1%. Retail sales alone were up 0.2%.  Total retail sales are up 8.5% from a year ago (8.1% including food service).  
"
164,AZO,"The Retail Sales report covers far more than just the Malls and is a very broad based measure of consumer spending. Since consumer spending makes up 70% of the economy, it is a very important number. That overstates things a bit since retail sales are mostly about the sale of goods, not services; and services make up two thirds of what consumers spend. Still, it is a pretty important thing to watch.  
"
165,AZO,"Auto (and parts) sales were up 0.8%, partially reversing a 1.8% drop in May. On a year over year basis they were up a solid 8.9%. That figure includes sales at parts dealers like Autozone (AZO  -  Free Report) as well as the dealers like CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report).    
"
166,AZO,"Excluding autos, retail sales were unchanged, in line with expectations, down from the May rise of 0.2%.  Year over year sales are up 7.9%. The year over year numbers are pretty robust, but keep in mind that these numbers are not adjusted for price changes, so part of the year over year gains simply reflect inflation. However, outside of food and energy, inflation is very tame on a year over year basis. On a month to month basis energy prices are falling, while other prices are still rising slightly.  
"
167,AZO,"The growth was uneven, and that may be the more important story. Sales were weak in many of the more discretionary types of retail sales for the second month in a row. The report tracks 13 major categories of stores, of which eight were up and five down on the month. Year over year, all  types of stores with the exception of Electronics and Appliances are showing increases, ranging from 0.5% (Furniture stores) to 23.6% for Gas Stations.   
"
168,AZO,"Clearly, gas prices were the major factor in the increased sales at the corner ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) station, not a sudden rise in the number of 44oz. fountain drinks being consumed. Actually the evidence suggests that the volume of gasoline sold is actually declining slightly in response to higher prices. 
"
169,AZO,"Aside from the Gas Stations, which are clearly a special case, the next strongest group on a year over year basis was the non-store retailers, the group that includes the catalog and Internet retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). They are up 14.7% year over year. As noted above, the Auto Dealers and Parts stores were up 8.9% year over year.  
"
170,AZO,"Not surprisingly, the worst performers on the month were the gas stations, where sales fell 1.3% after a 0.5% rise last month. Falling revenues at gas stations is a good sign, not a bad one. Money not spent at the pump can be spent elsewhere, and much of the cash spent on gasoline flows abroad to pay for oil imports, rather than recirculating in the economy.  
"
171,AZO,"The other part of non-core inflation, food, showed an increase, of 0.3%, after falling 0.1% in May. Sales at Grocery stores (and other stores selling food and beverages, excluding restaurants) jumped by 6.8% year over year. Sales of food for the home are among the least discretionary purchases, along with gasoline.  Spending at Health Care stores, such as Walgreen's (WAG) also tends to be relatively stable. That was the one stable area to see a decline, with sales down 0.2% on the month, but only after an increase of 1.2% in May. Sales are up 4.1% year over year.   
"
172,AZO,"It was the highly discretionary types of retail sales that took it on the chin in June. Sales at Electronics and Appliance stores are a good example. They fell 0.2% on the month, but that is on the heels of a 1.8% plunge in May. Year over year, sales are down 2.4%. However, on the electronics side of things, prices generally decline over time, so the situation is a bit of the flip side of what is going on at the gas stations (year over year).

"
174,AZO,"Sporting Goods and Hobby stores saw sales fall, with a drop of 0.7% on top of a 0.4% decline last month, and up just 3.3% year over year. This category also includes book stores, so the bankruptcy and partial liquidation of Borders may be distorting the numbers in this group.  Longer term though, the switch to electronic book sales, such as on the iPad or the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Kindle pose a secular and existential treat to the book store category. Those electronic sales are mostly made by firms in the non-store retailing category.

"
175,AZO,"Clothing stores like Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) showed some improvement, with sales up 0.7% after being unchanged in May. Relative to a year ago they are up 6.5%, which is a bit below average. A new pair of jeans is a bit less discretionary than a new kitchen table, but less discretionary than going to the grocery store.  
"
176,AZO,"General Merchandise stores, a category that includes the Department stores, saw a 0.4% increase on the month, after falling 0.1% in May. Year over year General Merchandise sales are up 4.0%, so sales are generally on the soft side at the mall anchors as well as the stores in the periphery of the Mall. 
"
177,AZO,"Going out to eat and drink is also a very discretionary item, and sales at bars and restaurants were down 0.4%, after rising 0.8% in May. Year over year sales are up 4.7%.  
"
178,AZO,"Overall, I have to call this a mixed report. The overall number was low, but in line with expectations.  My concern is more in the mix, with a very sharp slowdown in the sorts of sales that signal confidence on the part of the consumer.  
"
179,AZO,"Keep in mind that these numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but inflation is low and likely to remain low.  The bond market is crystal clear on its view that inflation will remain low.

"
182,AZO,"The second graph, (also from Calculated Risk)  shows the year over year change in sales excluding gasoline going back to 1993.

184,AZO,"Earnings Preview 5/20/11
"
185,AZO,"Earnings season is starting to wind down, with just a few stragglers left. A total of 99 firms are due to report, including 13 from the S&P 500. Mostly we are down to the retailers, many of which have fiscal period ends a month later than everyone else.
"
186,AZO,"The firms reporting this week include AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Heinz (HNZ) and Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report). North of the border, the major Canadian banks will all be reporting, including Toronto Dominion (TD), Bank Of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY).
"
187,AZO,"It will be an average week for economic data. We start off with New Home Sales and Durable Goods orders on Tuesday, followed by the second look at first quarter GDP on Wednesday, and finish up the week on Friday with data on Personal Income and Spending, as well as the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the core PCE index.MondayNothing of significance.TuesdayNew Home Sales are expected to remain at the 300,000 rate they were at in March. That is simply a pathetic level, even if it is slightly off the record low set in January. The records go back to the Kennedy administration. If we do come in at 300,000, that is still lower than any month prior to 2010. Unlike used home sales, each new home sold represents a lot of economic activity. Thus this is a very important report. Normally, new home sales are what leads the economy out of recessions, but they have been a huge drag this time around.New Orders for Durable Goods are expected to drop by 2.0% after rising 2.5% in March. Previous months are often revised significantly for this data, and the recent trend has been for upward revisions, so it would not be surprising to see March revised up to about 2.9%. Much of the weakness expected comes from the highly volatile transportation equipment segment. Since they are so high priced, a few orders for jetliners can really push around the total number, but the orders tend to be lumpy. Excluding transportation equipment, new orders are expected to rise 0.6% down from an increase of 1.3% last month. Thus, with the exception of transportation equipment, things are slowing down, but not headed down.WednesdayThe second look at GDP growth in the first quarter is released. The initial read was a disappointing growth rate of just 1.8%, down from growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter. The consensus is looking for a slight upward revision to 2.0% growth. That is still quite anemic, particularly coming out of a deep recession. The composition of the growth rate is just as important as the overall growth rate itself. Growth that comes from the build-up of inventories for example is of much lower quality than business investment in new equipment and software. We will provide a complete breakdown of which parts of the economy are adding to growth, and which are serving as brakes on economic growth, and how the contributions have changes since the first look at the numbers last month.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in they year, but then had a very rough month or so in March and April. The last two weeks have been much more encouraging. Last week they fell sharply, by 29,000 to 409,000. A further decline is expected next week, getting us back below the psychologically important 400,000 level. The four week moving average will probably stay well above the 400,000 level.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 81,000 to 3.711 million. That is down 937,000 from a year ago. I would expect a decline this week. The consensus is looking for a level of 3.700 million. Some of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Those however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 4,000 to 4.109 million, and are down by 1.278 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.937 million, which is down 47,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not exactly match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.120 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Given the differential between job growth and the decline in total people getting benefits, it looks like about 1 million people have simply run out of benefits, and have not found new work. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayPersonal Income is expected to have increased by 0.4% in April, down from a 0.5% increase in March. This is a broad measure of income, not just wages and salaries. The composition is important, as over the last year or so, much of the growth in income has come from transfer payments, not from wage growth. Personal Spending is expected to have slowed to an increase of 0.5% from 0.6% last month. That is still more than the increase in income -- meaning some more downward pressure on the savings rate. A falling savings rate boosts the economy in the short term, but a low savings rate is not healthy over the long term. The U.S. still has a very low savings rate relative to both history and the rest of the world, although it is significantly higher than it was a few years ago.The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey is expected to be unchanged at 72.4. That is a lot better than where it was a year ago, but not exactly a robust reading.
"
188,AZO,"Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
189,AZO,"Historically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.
"

191,AZO,"Earnings Preview 2/25/11
"
192,AZO,"The fourth quarter earnings season is almost over. A total of 350 firms are due to report, but only 13 are S&P 500 firms. A great many of next week’s reporters are retailers, many of which have fiscal years than end in January, not December.
"
193,AZO,"So far earnings season seems to be going well. With 95.8% of the S&P 500 reports in, total net income is up 29.6% over a year ago. The firms reporting this week include AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Heinz (HNZ), Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report), Novell (NOVL) and Range Resources (RRC).  
"
194,AZO,"It will be a heavy week for economic data. We will get data on Personal Income and Spending, both ISM reports (manufacturing and non-manufacturing), a revised look at Productivity and Unit Labor Costs in the fourth quarter. We wrap up the week with the payroll data for February.MondayPersonal Income is expected to have increased by 0.1% in January, down from a 0.4% increase in December. Personal Spending is expected to have increased by at 0.4%, down from a 0.7% increase December. Of course if spending is rising faster than income, it implies a fall in the savings rate. Over the short term that is a good thing, but in the longer term that is very bad news. In addition to the amount that Personal income goes up, the data breaks out the sources of that income growth. Over the last few years far too much of that income growth has come from higher transfer payments from the government, and not from higher wages and salaries. That started to change a bit last month, and it would be nice to see more increases in paycheck income. Dividend income will probably rise nicely, but be offset by a fall in interest income due to the ultra low interest rate environment we are in.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index is expected to dip slightly to 67.5 from 68.8 last month.  This is a regional “mini ISM. Like the ISM, any number over 50 indicates expansion, so we are still talking about pretty robust growth, just a bit slower than last month though. Not that significant in and of itself, but it might give a heads up on the ISM number, particularly if there is a big change in it.TuesdayThe ISM manufacturing index is expected to slip slightly from its 60.8 level last month to 60.5%. As a “magic 50 index that reading would mean that the manufacturing side of the economy is continuing to grow, but it is doing so at a slower pace than it was in January. In addition to the overall index, pay close attention to how some of the key sub-indexes which cover production, new orders and employment are faring. The 60.8 level last month was very strong.Construction Spending fell by 2.5% in December. The consensus is looking for a decline of 0.6% for January. Look for possible revisions to the December number as well.Auto and light truck sales probably continued to accelerate from the 12.6 million seasonally adjusted annual rate they posted in January. That is well over the under 10 million pace at the depths of the Great Recession, but a far cry from the 16 to 17 million annual rates that were the norm before the recession. It will be a very long time before we hit those levels again, but we will continue to see vehicle sales slowly recover.WednesdayWe get the appetizer for the employment report in the form of the ADP employment survey. Last month, the ADP raised hopes greatly when they reported a net increase of 187,000 private sector jobs. That set up a big disappointment when the BLS reported a gain of just 50,000 private sector jobs. It was the second month in a row where the ADP number was FAR higher than the BLS number. As the firm that actually cuts the checks of most companies payrolls, ADP is in an excellent position to gauge the strength of the job market. However, its numbers are often quite different than the private sector jobs numbers that are reported by the BLS on Friday. The BLS numbers do tend to be revised in the direction of the ADP numbers, so the big differential last month might be pointing to an upward revision to the November numbers when the BLS reports.Challenger Gray and Christmas, the big outplacement firm, will release its tabulation of large layoffs. They were down 46.1% year over year in January. I would expect a similar year-over-year decline in February.The Fed Releases its Beige Book, a collection of mostly anecdotal evidence on the state of the economy. The overall tone of the Beige Books has been improving over the last year or so, and I would expect that trend to continue.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They have been extremely erratic of late. Last week they fell by 22,000 in the last week, to 391,000. The consensus is for them to bounce slightly to 400,000. Given how volatile initial claims have been over the last month or so, that seems to very possible. Still, even a level of 400,000 seems pretty good compared to the experience of the last few years. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims were locked in a tight “trading range."" We now appear to have broken out of that trading range to the downside. This could well indicate that the economy is about to start producing a significant number of new jobs.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 145,000 to 3.790 million. That is down 1.004 million from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 65,000 to 4.437 million, and are down by 1.232 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.159 million, which is down 90,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.235 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.We get the second read on Productivity growth in the Fourth quarter. In the first look it was 2.6%, up from 2.3% in the third quarter. The consensus is looking for a slight upward revision to 2.7%. However, after today’s downward revision to 4Q GDP growth, that is highly unlikely, and a downward revision to 2.4 or 2.5% growth seems more likely to me. Over the long run, productivity is probably the single most important economic statistic there is. It is productivity, after all, that determines per capita GDP, and that is the GDP growth that really counts. Growing simply because there are more people in the country does not improve living standards. However, in the short term, rapid increases in output per hour are not particularly helpful in raising the number of hours worked (i.e. reducing unemployment).Unit Labor Costs fell by 0.6% in the fourth quarter in the first look. That is a sharp acceleration in the decline from the 0.1% in the third quarter. The consensus is looking for a revised decline of 0.8%. However if productivity is revised down as I expect, then we will probably see a smaller decline in unit labor costs than in the first look. Still down, but not quite as much. The growth in productivity was greater than the increase in compensation for labor. Falling unit labor costs are one of the big reasons for the high net margin fueled earnings growth that we have been seeing in the recent earnings reports. Essentially all of the gains from productivity growth are accruing to the owners of capital rather than the providers of labor. Capital getting the lion’s share of that growth has been the pattern for several years now, but historically the two factors of production tended to share equally in the fruits of productivity growth. In the short term, that is certainly good for corporate profits and hence the stock market. However, the resulting large disparities in income inequality are seen by many (including myself) as one of the underlying causes of the financial meltdown and the resulting Great Recession.The ISM Services Index is expected to have slipped a bit from the extremely strong 59.4 reading in February. The consensus is for it to slip to 59.0. This is also a “magic 50 index, so we could see a decline and still indicate that the service side of the economy is still growing. As with the ISM manufacturing index, the behavior of the key sub-indexes of business activity, new orders and employment are at least as interesting as the overall level of the index.FridayThe most important report of the week is the employment report. In January, payrolls seriously disappointed by rising by only 36,000 and 50,000 on the private side. Growth should pick up in February, but total payrolls will likely again be lower than private sector payrolls, as State and Local governments continue to lay people off to deal with their dismal fiscal situations. Consensus estimates expect total growth of about 172,000 in total and 185,000 on the private side. Revisions to prior months' numbers will also be important, and in recent months they have been upward significantly. The unemployment rate might bump up a bit from the 9.0% rate in January. The consensus is looking for a 9.1% rate. The two-month fall in the unemployment rate is the biggest since 1958, but it has happened without a lot of support from job creation in the establishment survey. Much of the change in the unemployment rate will depend on the civilian participation rate, which fell to 63.2% in January from 64.3% in December. If it continues to decline, the unemployment rate might stay where it is, or even fall further. If the participation rate stops falling the unemployment rate will likely shoot upwards. That would not really be all bad. The key measure will be the percentage of people who are actually working. That ticked up to 58.4% In January from 58.3% in December, but is still extremely low. The report will probably show that average hourly earnings increased slightly in February, most likely at a slower pace than the 0.4% increase in January.  The average workweek was probably unchanged at 34.2 hours. Overall, that adds up to middling report. Keep an eye on the duration of unemployment numbers which remain at historically very high levels.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
195,AZO,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.Potential Positive Surprises:
"
196,AZO,"Nacco Industries (NC) is expected to report $4.23 vs. $2.48 last year.

The earnings miss prompted us to cut our losses and sell AZO.
"
584,AZO,"Gafisa SA  was also removed from the Focus List after the close. GFA had a nice run in the portfolio, posting some solid gains on more encouraging data out of the housing market and strength in the emerging Brazilian economy. But within the last couple days, the current-year estimate dropped 15 cents to $1.84 per share. We will be exiting our position with a respectable gain around 10%.
"
585,AZO,"Focus List UpdatesMonro Muffler Brake Inc.  (MNRO  -  Free Report) finished unchanged on news that the company is raising its second-quarter guidance. We took a long look at the automotive company after AutoZone's miss the other day. However, management raising the lower end of its earnings estimate to 47 cents, from 43 cents, fortifies the decision to keep Monro in the portfolio. The higher end of the guidance remained at 48 cents. 
"
586,AZO,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) declared a dividend of 55 cents per share, noting that it is payable Dec 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 1.

"
588,AZO,"A Growth and Income AdditionE.I. du Pont (DD) was added to the Growth & Income portfolio after the close. The company is a diversified chemical and products manufacturer which makes everything from laminate flooring, to Teflon, to crop protection products.

"

"
626,AZO,"As I write this, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) are trading higher in response to raised fiscal second-quarter estimates from one brokerage analyst. The change has yet to be factored into the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which currently stands at 47 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly higher at 48 cents per share. The home goods retailer has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters and could be a beneficiary of the rebound in housing. Bed, Bath & Beyond is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 23, after the close of trading.
"
627,AZO,"Though used cars did not qualify for the Cash for Clunkers rebates, optimism about CarMax's (KMX  -  Free Report) second-quarter results has been growing. During the past few weeks, 4 brokerage analysts have raised their profit projections. The revisions have pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 2 cents higher to 18 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 19 cents per share. KMX beat expectations over the past 2 quarters after previously missing twice. CarMax is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 22, before the start of trading.
"
628,AZO,"Though KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) is projected to have lost 68 cents per share, the actual fiscal third-quarter loss could be less than most analysts forecast. The most accurate estimate is far more bullish, calling for a loss of 61 cents per share, and the homebuilder has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters. KB Home is scheduled to report on Friday, Sep 25, before the start of trading.
"
629,AZO,"Research in Motion (RIMM) has topped expectations for 3 consecutive quarters. Ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter report, 3 analysts have raised their projections. The changes were not significant enough to move the Zacks Consensus Estimate from its current level of $1 per share, though the most accurate estimate is a penny higher, at $1.01 per share. Research in Motion is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 24, after the close of trading.
"
630,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesTexas Industries (TXI) has missed expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters.

There was no company news. Volume was higher than normal at 202,000 shares compared to 169,000 shares. 
"
655,AZO,"Despite its recent run-up, the #2 Rank (buy) stock is still fairly cheap. NewMarket trades at just 11.4x forward earnings. We're going to continue to holding NewMarket since it has excellent fundamentals and the stock has upward momentum.MEDNAX, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) is one just 3 stocks that is slightly in the red in the Focus List. Therefore, we are watching it closely. It didnt help matters that the stock dropped 0.94% today on light volume and no news. However, weve only held MD for a few weeks and its portfolio loss is a mere 1.67%. 
"
656,AZO,"More importantly, the companys solid fundamentals point to outperformance going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimates remain bullish. For the full year, earnings estimates are up 8% over the past 2 months. For 2010, analysts polled by Zacks are calling for year-over-year growth of 11%. Well keep holding here, looking for a turnaround into positive territory.       
"
657,AZO,"We are keeping an even closer eye on AutoZone Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report). It is down 5.43% since being added to the portfolio in mid-June.  We are not yet ready to give up on AZO as we believe that it will rebound. However, we will also be careful not to let the loss get too big should it continue falling.       
"
658,AZO,"Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) caught a nice bid off news that Blockbuster will close up to 960 stores by the end of 2010, sending shares of NFLX up 3.90% on the day. The news from Blockbuster comes as the company tries to restructure some of its short-term debt and focuses on a smaller number of core stores to move back into profitability.
"
659,AZO,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) also closed on the right side of the ledger, adding 3.46% on the day on an analyst upgrade.

"
663,AZO,"Overview - Neutral 
"
664,AZO,"OPPORTUNITIES 
"
665,AZO,"The industry is very concentrated, with the top 8 global automakers having more than 90% of global revenues, and the top 50 global auto parts companies having 80% of global revenues (the top 4 US tire producers have 75% of the US market).
"
666,AZO,"There is a focus on automation and simplifying product lines to lower costs and benefit from economies of scale. The average car now needs only 15-25 man-hours per vehicle, and this drops 2% annually.
"
667,AZO,"Hybrid/alternative cars represent a source of growth in the future. Market share gains by hybrids/alternatives will be slow, and they are now only 4% of cars on the road. General Motors (GMGMQ) and Chrysler both have filed for (and are currently emerging from) bankruptcy, and will become more competitive in the long run.
"
668,AZO,"WEAKNESSES 
"
669,AZO,"Earnings are below expectations and have been for some time. Demand for autos is down 35% due to a weak economy and weakening real estate market.
"
670,AZO,"Demand is also hurt by weakening employment. The recent credit crunch is crippling to auto sales, and this has a trickle-down effect throughout the industry.
"
671,AZO,"Furthermore, there is a slowdown of SUV sales, which are 55% of sales (cars are 45%). Imports have also been more competitive, as they tend to have better gas mileage. Costs for domestic producers is much higher than seen for foreign producers, and this is creating a loss of market share in the US by US producers. Also, the presence of unions has led to costs being much higher than seen in other countries.
"
672,AZO,"Pricing averages (2)% in this sector annually. Incentives are increasing as the industry is trying to increase sales. Overcapacity is about 20% in this sector. Pension deficits are rising due to a weak stock market, lower interest rates and less pension funding.
"
673,AZO,"BUY/SELL RATINGS 
"
674,AZO,"AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) is a Buy due to improving same-store sales and a resurgence in the used car and auto parts market. TRW Automotive (TRW) is a Buy due to restructuring.
"
675,AZO,"Autozone Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) continues to trade mostly sideways in spite of strong earnings estimates and attractive valuations. The current-year jumped after AZO reported solid third-quarter earnings in late May, increasing 40 cents to $11.70 per share. Based on this estimate, this stock has a forward P/E multiple of 13X, in line with the overall market but with a nice 12% earnings growth projection in the next-year period. 
"
676,AZO,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is set to report its fourth-quarter results this week on July 16. Estimates have been on the rise into the number. The current-year is up an impressive 38 cents to $2.06 in the last 90 days. The next-year estimate is up 49 cents in the same period to $2.09.
"
677,AZO,"AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) reported a strong fiscal second-quarter performance earlier today, as many drivers are opting to fix up their current vehicles rather than buying new ones during this recession. 
"
678,AZO,"Shares of the leading automotive replacement parts and accessories retailer are up more than 8% Tuesday, which makes it one of the top-performing Zacks #1 Rank companies. 
"
679,AZO,"AZO reported $2.03 for the quarter, compared to $1.67 a year earlier. Analysts were only expecting $1.85. This marks the company's second consecutive quarter of better-than-expected quarterly profit.

"
700,AZO,"During the past few weeks, 3 of the 18 covering brokerage analysts raised their fiscal second-quarter profit projections on Autozone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report). The revisions pushed the consensus earnings estimate back up to $1.84 per share. The most accurate estimate is far more bullish, at $1.93 per share. AZO has beat expectations twice during the past 4 quarters, but also missed once. AutoZone is scheduled to report Tuesday, Mar 3, before the start of trading.
"
701,AZO,"Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc. (FSYS) has topped expectations for 4 consecutive quarters. Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter report, 1 brokerage analyst raised his profit forecast, which helped the consensus earnings estimate rise back to 41 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 50 cents per share. This is a volatile stock with the potential to respond to good earnings. Fuel Systems Solutions is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 5, after the close of trading.
"
702,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
703,AZO,"Earlier this month, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) warned that fiscal second-quarter earnings would be ""substantially below"" the consensus earnings estimate. The company blamed the economy, price-based promotions and lower gasoline profits for the warning. Nearly all of the covering analysts cut their projections in response, sending the average profit forecast 11 cents lower to 60 cents per share. Costco has historically met or topped expectations, so a miss may not occur. However, forecasts for the remainder of fiscal 2009 have been cut and it is probable that guidance for the second-half of the year will be disappointing. Costco is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Mar 4, before the start of trading.
"
704,AZO,"Tech Data Corporation (TECD  -  Free Report) has missed profit expectations for 2 consecutive quarters. Though earnings estimates are unchanged ahead of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report, forecasts for fiscal 2010 are dropping. This suggests a strong possibility of disappointing guidance. Tech Data is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Mar 3, before the start of trading.

"
716,AZO,"No companies are expected to top expectations. CKE Restaurants, Inc. (CKR) and National Semiconductor Corporation (NSM) could miss estimates. The previous version of this week's article had previously listed the wrong ticker for CKE Restaurants. The correct ticker is CKR.
"
717,AZO,"Just 49 companies have been confirmed to report for the second week of December. Within this group are S&P 500 members AutoZone, Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report), Ciena Corporation (CIEN  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report), The Kroger Co.

"
718,AZO,"(The light earnings calendar is typical for this time of year. Except for a mid-December bump when some early reporters give their end-of-year results, there will not be a significant number of earnings reports until the second-half of January.)
"
719,AZO,"The scheduled economic data should not move the markets significantly. October pending homes sales might get more attention on Tuesday given the recent rebound in homebuilding stocks, but I don't expect it to have a meaningful impact.
"
720,AZO,"Tuesday: October pending home sales
"

"
724,AZO,"Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner will speak in Geneva about the potential for market instability on Monday. Later in the day, Vice Chairman Donald Kohn will talk about the banking system at a housing forum in Washington, D.C.
"
725,AZO,"The Fed will hold its final scheduled meeting of the year on Dec 16. Futures are pricing a 75-basis point cut.
"
726,AZO,"Congress could hold a vote on whether to extend the Big 3 financing. Many senators were not swayed on Thursday, however, so it is unclear what the future of the bailout is.

729,AZO,"Trends in earnings estimate revisions do not suggest any of the companies reporting will top expectations.
"
730,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
731,AZO,"All of the covering brokerage analysts cut their fiscal third-quarter profit projections on CKE Restaurants, Inc. (CKR) over the past few weeks. One reason might have been the company's observation that restaurant operating costs rose 60 to 80 basis points during the quarter. The downward revisions caused the consensus earnings estimate to fall 7 cents to 10 cents per share. CKE has missed during the past 3 quarters. CKE Restaurants is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Dec 10, after the close of trading.
"
732,AZO,"Last month, National Semiconductor Corporation (NSM) revised its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance. Due to weakness in the wireless handset market, the company expects sales to total between $420 and $425 million. (Previously, NSM predicted sales of $470 to $480 million.) The majority of the covering brokerage analysts quickly cut their profit forecasts, causing the consensus earnings estimate to fall 8 cents to 24 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 20 cents per share. Investors should also note that NSM missed first-quarter expectations by a penny per share. National Semiconductor is scheduled to report on Monday, Dec 8, after the close of trading.

749,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings SurprisesAutoZone Inc. (AZO  -  Free Report) has topped market expectations twice in the last three quarters. Ahead of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report, brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts. The consensus earnings estimate now calls for earnings of $3.90 per share, a penny higher than a week ago. The most accurate estimate is even more bullish at $3.92 per share. Autozone is scheduled to report on Monday, Sep 22, before the start of trading.

757,AZO,"The New Year Shift
"
758,AZO,"With the new year, we turn our attention to 2008 and 2009 from 2007 and 200 and the tables will be significantly different from those of weeks past. In our system, the fiscal year is determined on if the year has been completed, not if it has been reported. Thus 2007 is now FY(0) and 2008 is now FY(1).
"
759,AZO,"The total number of estimates for 2009 is still thin, and the number of estimate revisions is even thinner. Thus, dont put too much emphasis on the 2009 data yet. Also realize that the changes in growth rates you will see over the coming weeks will be as much a reflection of new estimates being added as changes in existing estimates.
"
760,AZO,"Earnings Scorecard and Median Growth Rates
"
761,AZO,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is off to a mixed start. Positive surprises are out numbering disappointments by just over 2:1, which is a little bit behind the normal 3:1 margin. The median surprise is a healthy 3.36%. The median year-over-year growth rate is 6.98%, which is well behind the double-digit median growth rates we have been accustom to for the last five years.
"
762,AZO,"It is still very early, with less than 5.0% of firms reporting, and the sample of fourth-quarter earnings is hardly representative. Five sectors have yet to have any firms report.
"
763,AZO,"Among those that do have reports in, Tech looks terrific with median year-over-year growth of 29.7%. That number should come down significantly as the reporting season wears on as the remaining firms have a median expected growth rate of 14.3%. Still, that sort of growth is better than a sharp stick in the eye, and should be good enough for silver in the median year-over-year growth race. On the other hand, the Financials would probably prefer the sharp stick in the eye. The median earnings growth is -141.5%, indicating that more than half the reporting firms have moved from positive earnings in a year ago to a loss this year. That number should get better as reporting season continues, but is still likely to be anemic at best when all is said and done. The median expected year-over-year growth for the remaining firms in the sector is just 2.7%, and the estimates are falling fast.
"
764,AZO,"Energy should be the top performing sector on a median growth rate basis with 19.0% growth anticipated. Tech and Industrials are predicted to take the silver and bronze with growth rates of 14.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Utilities and Health Care should make it over the double-digit threshold as well with 12.8% and 10.8% growth, respectively. Materials, Telecom and Consumer Discretionary are expected to be the weakest on a median growth rate basis.

"
766,AZO,"On a total net income basis, the fourth quarter can be summed up in a single word: UGLY. Total net income reported so far is 18.2% below year ago levels. However it very much looks like a tale of two markets, with Tech doing well and Financials doing awful. The Financials total net income is 38.0% below year ago levels, and based on the expectations of the yet to report firms (-55.4%), should deteriorate further. Telecom will lead the pack but that is artificially boosted by the AT&T/Bell South merger a year ago.
"
767,AZO,"Technology total income should come down slightly from the 22.9% growth reported so far, based on the 19.8% growth expected for those yet to report. Energy and Health Care dont have any firms which have reported yet, but should turn in double-digit total net income growth performances of 14.9% and 11.4%, respectively.
"
768,AZO,"While at first glance, looking at the yet to be reported group (the vast majority of firms), a decline of 8.5% in total earnings looks bleak, keep in mind just how concentrated the declines are. If just Financials are excluded, expected total net income growth jumps to positive growth of 7.2%. Given the importance of the Financials to both the market and to the overall economy, that may be a little akin to asking: ""Aside from that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play,"" but it does help put things into perspective. If one goes one step further and excludes the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is being hammered by some of the effects of the consumer credit crunch and a very promotional Christmas season, the overall growth rate in total net income jumps to the double digits at 10.8%. Looking forward to the first quarter, many of the same trends are in place, albeit in a more muted fashion with significant weakness expected among the Financials and the Discretionary firms and significant strength in Technology and Energy.

"
770,AZO,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
771,AZO,"The revisions ratio for 2008 is 0.56, indicating nearly two estimate cuts for every increase. The total number of revisions over the last four weeks was slightly lower than it was last week (three weeks of overlap) largely due to the holidays. As earnings season gets into full swing over the next few weeks the totals will climb significantly from current levels.
"
772,AZO,"By far the sector that is faring the worst is the Financials where cuts outnumber increases by almost 10:1. In fact, the Financial sector accounts for 47% of all the estimate cuts for 2008. Put another way, the revisions ratio for the rest of the S&P 500 is 0.95, which is very much in the neutral range.
"
773,AZO,"The revisions ratios for the Materials and Utilities sectors were also ugly at 0.24 and 0.30 respectively, however the total number of revisions for those two sectors was very light, which means that the picture is not quite as bleak as it appears at first glance.
"
774,AZO,"The Consumer Discretionary sector was also weak with almost two cuts for every increase, and that on a much more robust total number of estimate revisions. Just three firms, AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) accounted for 41% of all upward revisions in the sector however. Note that the ratio of firms with rising estimates to falling estimates confirms the weak numbers for the sectors with weak revisions ratios.
"
775,AZO,"Only two sectors were showing substantial strength, Energy and Staples. Both had a reasonably robust total number of revisions.  The reason for the strength in Energy is clear enough: $100/barrel. For Staples it appears that much of the strength comes from the grocery stores where higher food prices are helping profitability.

"
777,AZO,"The first peak at 2009 revisions shows that analysts are already revising their estimates downward on balance for the year, although not at the same rate they are doing so for 2008. As with 2008, Energy and the defensive Health Care and Staples sectors are doing well while the picture for the Financials looks bleak. However, the total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is just 600 (250 up and 350 down) and the numbers for some of the individual sectors are very light. If this holds up, the go heavy on Energy and light on Financials play that was so profitable in 2007 looks like it will work again in 2008.

"
779,AZO,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
780,AZO,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
781,AZO,"Despite their current problems, the Financials still have a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials will account for 22.7% of the total net income for the S&P 500. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is the cheapest on a P/E basis, it is still the second largest overall influence on the market. For many years it was clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Just within the last moth it lost that spot to the Tech sector. Based on 2007 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of only 12.5x and based on 2008, only 10.4x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
782,AZO,"Energy is the second largest sector based on total earnings, both for 2007 (15.6%) or 2008 (15.2%), but is a fairly distant third when it comes to total market capitalization (and thus weight in the index) at 12.8%. On a P/E basis, Energy is the second cheapest sector at 13.7x for 2007 and 12.2x for 2008.
"
783,AZO,"Much has changed during 2007, and it is likely that much will also change in 2008 as well. At the start of 2007, the Financials represented 21.9% of the S&P 500 total market capitalization and were expected to provide 26.9% of the total earnings. In other words the sector has lost 4.92% of ""market cap share"" in just one year, and 4.16% of 2007 ""earnings share"".
"
784,AZO,"For perspective, the whole Utilities sector currently comprises just 3.53% of market capitalization and 3.30% of 2007 earnings. Energy on the other hand has seen its share of the market capitalization of the index rise 3.80% share points.
"
785,AZO,"Clearly the Financials are a big influence on the market, comprising 17.1% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. The credit crunch and mortgage woes have had an effect on the sector. At the beginning of 2007, it comprised 21.9% of the market capitalization of the index. The Financials sector is relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be a big influence on the market, since they contribute 22.3% of the total expected earnings for 2007 and 23.2% of the expected earnings for 2008.  However, at the start of the year, Financials represented 26.9% of the expected earnings for 2007. The Financials are the cheapest sector in the market followed Energy on a P/E basis. However, given recent events in the credit markets there have to be serious questions about how real the earnings are for many of the firms in the sector. Given the pace of estimate cuts, look for the actual total earnings to be significantly less than is currently forecast.
"
786,AZO,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the 12.4% of the total market capitalization of the index. It is expected to contribute 15.2% of the total earnings in 2007 and 14.7% in 2008. At the beginning of the year Energy was just 9.0% of the total market capitalization of the index. Tech on the other hand represents 17.4% of the total market capitalization, but only 12.5% of the 2007, and 13.2% of the 2008 total earnings. Tech recently dethroned Financials as the biggest sector in the market, a position it has not held since the height of the dotcom bubble. Energy last held the title back in the late 1970s.
"
787,AZO,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 13.6x 2007 and 12.1x 2008 earnings. The Financials are trading for 12.7x 2007 and 10.6x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.6x and 14.3x, respectively. Tech continues to be the most expensive sector trading at 22.9x and 18.9x 2007 and 2008 earnings, respectively. Based on 2008 expectations the P/E for the overall market translates to an earnings yield of 6.9%, which is far more attractive than the 3.86% level available on a 10 year T-Note. The note however has been helped by a flight to quality. The yield on 10-year AA corporates is at 5.33%. Still, equities look much more attractive than bonds on this basis. However, keep in mind that these earning are after several years of very robust growth and corporate profits are near a record high percentage of GDP. If firms were to return to more normal levels of profitability, they would be much less attractively valued. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2008 P/E ratios.

"
791,AZO,"The prospects of a of the Fed giving investors a Hanukkah present (the next Fed meeting will occur on the seventh day of the Festival of Lights) and new funding into financial firms such as Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) put the markets into rally mode. Adding to the bullish sentiment was the third rebound by the S&P 500 after falling below 1420 this year. Other factors include hope for a Santa rally and the simple fact that December has been a very good month for the markets. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, December is the second best month of the year for the S&P 500 and the Dow.
"
792,AZO,"Before betting the farm, investors should realize that there are still many things that could cut off the music. Average holiday spending per consumer is down from last year, foreclosures are rising, energy is darn expensive, fourth-quarter economic growth is lackluster and the credit crunch is ongoing. Not to mention the fact that the margin for error is very large. In hindsight, it will be easy to say that the Fed should have done X, Y and Z, but right now, nobody really knows what X, Y and Z are.
"
793,AZO,"So how will this affect trading during the first week of December? It is difficult to say, but it would not surprise me to see the markets trade higher.
"
794,AZO,"There won't be much in the way of scheduled events to stop stocks from rising (though much of the movement has been caused by unscheduled events). Only 55 companies are confirmed to report earnings, four of which are in the S&P 500: Autozone (AZO  -  Free Report), Coviden (COV), National Semiconductor (NSM) and Novell (NOVL). Economic releases should not play a material role, unless the December ISM manufacturing index (Monday) and the November employment numbers (Friday) are exceptionally strong, which seems unlikely.

802,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Dec 3 - 7Casey's General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report) topped expectations the past two quarters by an average margin of about 20%. Ahead of the convenience store chain's third-quarter report, three of the four brokerage analysts have raised their profit forecasts. The effect of these revisions was a six-cent increase in the consensus estimate to 48 cents per share. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at 49 cents per share. Casey's General Stores is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Dec 5, after the close of trading.

Revenue growth in the third quarter was ""well over 30%"" and same-store sales have increased by double-digits. Slightly more than half of the covering analysts revised their third-quarter forecasts in response to the guidance, pushing the consensus estimate three cents higher to 57 cents per share.

Prior to the warning, brokerage analysts had been forecasting profits of 18 cents per share; now the consensus estimate calls for earnings of 11 cents per share. CHS missed expectations last quarter by a margin of four cents. Chico's FAS is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Dec 4, before the start of trading.

832,AZO,"It is going to be one very busy and volatile week.
"
833,AZO,"The main event is the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. This is will be a one-day meeting with a statement due out around 2:15 ET. Expectations call for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by as much as 50 basis points, though I think the cut will be 25 basis points. As important as the size of the rate cut will be, which is not guaranteed to happen, the wording in the statement will matter too. Any language judged to be overly hawkish or that signals the pace of growth is slowing too rapidly will cause some turmoil. Bluntly put, there is a lot of room for error. A ""sell on the news"" reaction to an otherwise favorable rate cut and statement is also not out of the realm of possibilities.
"
834,AZO,"Four of the leading investment banking firms will be reporting fiscal third-quarter results. Lehman Brothers (LEH) is scheduled for Tuesday morning. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) will report on Wednesday. Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will both report on Thursday. Profit forecasts have been falling for all four firms.
"
835,AZO,"Friday is a triple witching day, meaning stock options, index options and futures contracts will all expire. Combined, these expirations can lead to increased volatility. In addition, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, starts that evening. As a result, trading volume could taper in the afternoon and some of Friday's volatility could start on Thursday.
"
836,AZO,"To better convey just how the busy the week is going to be, here is a day by day schedule.
"
837,AZO,"Monday: The New York Fed's Empire State Index will be released in the morning. This is the last piece of ""up-to-the-date"" economic data released before the Fed meeting, though it is a regional survey. Two companies are scheduled to report including S&P 500 member Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report)
"
838,AZO,"Tuesday: Lehman Brothers will report before the bell and will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET. August PPI will be released in the morning, giving the Fed one additional reading on inflation. The FOMC will release its statement around 2:15 (possibly, a few minutes earlier or later). In addition to Lehman, eight companies will report earnings including S&P 500 members AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report)
"
839,AZO,"Wednesday: August CPI, housing starts and building permits will be released in the morning. Morgan Stanley will report as will 13 other companies, including S&P 500 fellow member General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report).
"
840,AZO,"Thursday: Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs will report before the start of trading. (BSC was the only major brokerage firm to miss second-quarter expectations and profit forecasts have been falling ever since.) The Conference Board's index of leading indicators and weekly initial jobless claims will be published in the morning. In addition to BSC and GS, earnings reports from 15 other companies have been confirmed including S&P 500 members ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).
"
841,AZO,"Friday: Stock options, index options and futures contracts all expire. The Philadelphia Fed will release the results of its latest manufacturing survey around lunchtime. One company is confirmed to report. Yom Kippur starts at sundown.
"
842,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21General Mills recently revealed that it generated ""good sales and earnings per share gains for its fiscal 2008 first quarter"". The company guided for sales growth above its previous forecast of low single-digit growth and for earnings per share of about 81 cents per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate five cents higher to 81 cents per share. GIS matched fiscal fourth-quarter expectations after previously topping estimates for 10 consecutive quarters. General Mills is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 19, before the start of trading.

843,AZO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21
"
844,AZO,"As I stated previously, forecasts for Bear Stearns have been falling ever since the company missed second-quarter expectations. During the past three months, fiscal third-quarter profit projections have plunged 35% to $2.22 per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish at $1.70 per share, reflecting cuts by two brokerage analysts within the past seven days. Bear Stearns is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 20, before the start of trading.
"
845,AZO,"Lehman Brothers easily surpassed fiscal second-quarter expectations after coming up a penny shy during the first quarter. Profit forecasts for the fiscal third-quarter have dropped materially over the past 30 days with nine of the 14 covering brokerage analysts lowering their projections (including two within the past week). The current consensus estimate of $1.60 per share is 21 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at $1.47 per share. Lehman Brothers is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 18, before the start of trading.

853,AZO," OVERVIEWback to topThird quarter 2003 earnings season is almost over as 489 (or roughly 98%) of the companies in the S&P 500 have already announced earnings. To no surprise, the results have been very positive. The average gain in EPS from last year has been 18% with top line revenue growing at 10%. Both figures are easily running higher than Wall Streets expectations. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and into 2004, we remain optimistic that the positive earnings trend will continue. The current Wall Street consensus is for fourth quarter 2003 earnings to grow by 22% versus last year.  We believe that the current estimate is not only achievable but will be exceeded rather easily.From a valuation standpoint, the S&P 500 is trading at 20x 2003 earnings estimates with earnings projected to grow at 12% per year over the next three to five years. Given the strong positive earnings momentum, increasing quality of earnings through more conservative accounting practices and continued low interest rates, we believe there is a good chance the multiple will expand. However, the market is not cheap, especially since it is trading at the upper end of its P/E range over the past year. For the market rally to be sustainable, we will need the current fourth quarter estimates and estimates into 2004 to not only be maintained but raised. Thus far, it appears this will be the case as increased business confidence is leading to increased revenues for many companies. Given that many companies now have lean cost structures, we believe that there will be solid earnings growth as the economy continues to improve.This week, only 125 companies will release earnings results. Of which, 5 of those will be in the S&P 500. Despite the positive earnings news, we strongly recommend checking out the Zacks industry rankings provided in this report. The Zacks rank is based on a proprietary model that focuses on past earnings trends and forward earnings revisions from Wall Street analysts. The model has an excellent track record. Therefore, the Zacks industry rankings should provide an excellent starting point for your equity research.Companies in the spotlightIn this section, we will focus on two stocks that our independent equity analysts feel you should be buying or selling. Our analysts start with the quantitative Zacks model and build their final buy/sell decision by performing additional fundamental analysis on the company. To view the entire report on each of these spotlight companies or to gain access to our detailed analysis on over 1,350 companies, log on to www.zacksadvisor.com.Buy - AutoZone (Ticker: AZO) AutoZone, Inc. is the nations leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories, primarily focusing on the do-it-yourself customer. AutoZone sells hard parts, accessories, maintenance items, and other merchandise under brand names as well as private labels. The company owns more than 3,000 stores in the U.S. and 40 stores in Mexico. The business is made up of two segments - retail and commercial. The commercial segment supports the do-it-for-me group of customers, whereby AutoZone supplies parts and products to local dealers, repair and service shops.As a retailer, AZOs sales are contingent on consumer demand as it relates to the need for auto parts and accessories. Some of the issues influencing consumer demand for AZOs products include the state of the economy, seasonality, age of the average automobile on the road, and expiration of warranties. The average age of automobiles has perhaps the greatest influence on the demographics of the industry. The average age of cars on the road is increasing, which should drive the demand for auto repair.AutoZone continues to post favorable results with the fourth quarter (the period ending August 2003) surpassing expectations. While the company did report lower comparable store sales in the quarter compared to the year-earlier period, it was largely the result of facing a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter 2002 above-average level. Lower comparable store sales did limit some growth at the company. For the year, however, margins improved, new stores grew, sales per square foot increased, inventory appears lean, and cash flow was nearly $540 million (before share repurchases). These positive factors allowed for a variety of growth options and methods to enhance shareholder value, such as continued share repurchases. Earnings per share grew 48% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, which was stronger than we expected. Also, commercial comparable store sales have grown by greater than 20% over the last four quarters. This segment should be able to continue to drive growth over the next several years. Overall, we like AutoZones industry leading position, with sizable economies of scale helping to boost profitability and limit competitive entrants. Furthermore, the company has an aggressive share repurchase program, which is driving EPS and increasing shareholder value. Lastly, AZO is a growth stock that we believe offers upside potential at its current price given the companys solid track record, sizable commercial growth opportunities and strong fundamentals. We are raising our 2004 earnings estimate and maintaining our buy recommendation, with a price target of $109.75.Sell - Winn-Dixie Stores (Ticker: WIN)Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. was established in 1928 and operates a chain of retail self-service food chains in the U.S. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, Winn-Dixie operates in 12 states primarily in the southeastern part of the U.S. and the Bahama Islands. Its retail stores sell groceries, meat, seafood, flowers, bakery products, fuel, liquor, pharmaceutical products, and household and other general merchandise. The retail stores also operate pharmacies, company operated photo labs, in-store banking services, and dry cleaners.The company has more than 1,070 retail stores, 34 fuel centers (gas stations) and 31 liquor stores. In addition, Winn-Dixie operates 16 manufacturing plants and 15 warehouse distribution centers at strategic points to support its retail outlets. Winn-Dixie also has four wholly owned subsidiaries: Thriftway, Sack & Save, City Meat Markets, and Save Rite Grocery Warehouse. Winn-Dixies growth strategy has been based on its diversified food retailing. The companys primary objective has been to enhance its facilities within its stores. However, several factors have been responsible for its depressed quarterly figures. An overall sluggish economy added to negative sales momentum. This and the increased threat from competitors are driving our negative outlook on the company.The moderately growing U.S. economy has negatively affected the food retailing sector. The economic environment, characterized by higher unemployment, has discouraged consumers from spending more on higher-margin goods. Retailers are suffering from a decline in discretionary consumer spending, and Winn-Dixie is not an exception. Winn-Dixies stores in Florida are located along the Gulf Coast and have been further affected by the weak travel industry. Winn-Dixie is seeing increased competition from other value operators such as Wal-Mart and Publix. Both Wal-Mart and Publix have made inroads in the southeastern markets and are progressing steadily. Approximately 75% of the nationwide increase in net retail food capacity is attributable to Wal-Mart alone. Publix has also planned a major expansion program. It is likely to open more stores in the Southeast and spend around $600 million in this regard. Kroger, another competitor, has cut 1,500 jobs in order to cut costs, and this will likely spark further price cuts. Prices of most supermarket stocks tumbled in the wake of Krogers announcement, as higher costs continue to worry retailers.Winn-Dixie followed a strategy to upgrade its stores in order to attract customers. However, poor execution of this strategy resulted in inefficient stores and poor customer service, which allowed competitors to penetrate its markets. Winn-Dixie has lost market share in 35 of its 47 markets, mainly to Wal-Mart and Publix. Going forward, we foresee Winn-Dixies competitors becoming more prominent in the Southeast, further hurting Winn-Dixies market share. Considering these continued negative trends, we are maintaining our sell recommendation with a target price of $7.00. Early 3Q 2003 EARNINGS SCORECARD - S&P 50064% have beaten estimates

856,AZO,"This screening strategy has been such a great performer over the
"
857,AZO,"last few years, we like to re-publish it on a periodic basis for
"
858,AZO,"those who missed it in the past. So if you're looking for a 
"
859,AZO,"strategy that generates only a handful or so of stocks each 
"
860,AZO,"month, has an excellent win ratio and has shown consistently 
"
861,AZO,"impressive returns (way beyond the 'market'), ... read on. 
"
862,AZO,"The Parameters to this Strategy are:
"
863,AZO,"Zacks Rank = 1 (and no more than 4 weeks old - in other words, 
"
864,AZO,"it was a 2 or higher, 4 weeks prior)
"
865,AZO,"% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks >= 0 (earnings with
"
866,AZO,"fresh upward revisions)
"
867,AZO,"% Rating Change over 4 weeks >= 0 (analysts seemingly have such
"
868,AZO,"a huge upside bias, I'm excluding anything that's been even 
"
869,AZO,"slightly downgraded)
"
870,AZO,"Net % Change in Insider Holdings over 24 weeks >= 0 (very 
"
871,AZO,"simply, I'm excluding any stock where company insiders are net 
"
872,AZO,"sellers)
"
873,AZO,"P/E using 12 mo. Forward EPS Estimates 
"
874,AZO,"% Change Actual EPS Q0/Q-1 >= 0 (positive EPS growth this 
"
875,AZO,"quarter over last) and % Change Actual EPS Q-1/Q-2 >= 0 
"
876,AZO,"(positive EPS growth last quarter over the one before that) (In 
"
877,AZO,"other words, two quarters of positive EPS growth.)
"
878,AZO,"% Change Actual EPS F0/F-1 >= 0 (positive EPS growth this year 
"
879,AZO,"over last)
"
880,AZO,"5 Year Historical EPS Growth >= 17 (yes, 17)
"
881,AZO,"Last EPS Surprise >= 0 (no negative surprises allowed)
"
882,AZO,"Price/Sales ratio 
"
883,AZO,"And finally, the stocks all had to be trading at a minimum of 
"
884,AZO,"$3 or more. (The median price for the stocks that qualified this
"
885,AZO,"week is $49.69, with the cheapest one at $11.65.) 
"
886,AZO,"The Results:
"
887,AZO,"Over the last two years, this strategy has shown an average 
"
888,AZO,"annualized gross return in excess of 70%.
"
889,AZO,"This strategy is rebalanced monthly, holds an average of only 4 
"
890,AZO,"stocks at a time and has an impressive 76% win ratio (winning 
"
891,AZO,"periods).
