0,BRK.B,"It is not for no reason that Warren Edward Buffett is an investment guru. Suffice it to say that his company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report), has yielded a staggering return of more than 700% since inception.Buffett’s investing mantra is quite simple. He believes in purchasing shares of great companies and holding them for a considerable period of time. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time. They also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Such companies tend to belong to sectors such as technology, industrials, healthcare and communication services, to name a few. Solid economic growth and the Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates are providing the much-needed windfall to such sectors.Tech stocks, in particular, are hitting record highs as investors regained their appetite for risk. And why not? U.S. and Chinese officials resumed talks over trade issues, which helped soothe nerves. Threats of a trade war were looming large after President Trump recently prepared another gargantuan round of tariffs on Chinese imports.Let us, thus, focus on the Oracle of Omaha’s favored companies that are likely to make the most of the second-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on strong economic data. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a sign that corporates are finding ways to fill positions despite the lack of skilled workers. Such upbeat hiring figures breezed past analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions.Job gains were pretty broad-based, with white-collar jobs leading the way with 50,000 additions. From manufacturers, health-care providers to construction companies, all hired workers, a clear sign of a burgeoning economy.The unemployment rate rose to 4% last month, but for good reason. The jobless rate went up mostly because of around 600,000 people entering the labor force. This showed that more Americans are searching for jobs as they are easier to find.The U.S. economy, in the meanwhile, is projected to expand in the second quarter at an annual pace of nearly 4% after a 2.2% gain in the first three months of this year, economists say. This would put the economy in a solid position this year to meet or even beat 3% growth in gross domestic product, one of the primary aims of the government (read more: US GDP to Hit Elusive 3% Annual Growth in 13 Years: 5 Picks).At the same time, the tax overhaul policy will provide the much-needed wherewithal to corporates. After all, the tax laws gave companies massive relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas.4 Warren Buffett Stocks for Q2 EarningsAs mentioned above, Buffett’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. Banking on such positives, it will be prudent to invest in four of his favorite stocks from the aforementioned sectors that are expected to report a significant uptick in second-quarter earnings.Lest we forget, U.S. companies are expected to see one of the strongest second-quarter earnings season in almost a decade. Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies in the second quarter are estimated to improve 19.1% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues (read more: Start of Q2 Earnings Season).These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1,BRK.B,"Recent weeks have seen escalating trade hostility between the United States and China. However, starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts expect a strong Q2 earnings season, after solid jobs data spur a welcome shift in market narrative.Energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are likely to record the highest year-over-year earnings growth. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q2 earnings season.Q2 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors look forward to the outset of the Q2 earnings season this week, when bigwigs like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) will be reporting their Q2 numbers. Notably, for the whole of S&P 500, results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are estimated to improve 19% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 24.6% earnings growth on 8.7% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the highest growth in almost seven years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on strong economic data. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a sign that corporates are finding ways to fill positions despite the lack of skilled workers. Such upbeat hiring figures breezed past analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions.Job gains were pretty broad-based, with white-collar jobs leading the way with 50,000 additions.

This would put the economy in a solid position this year to meet or even beat 3% growth in gross domestic product (GDP), one of the primary aims of the government (read more: US GDP to Hit Elusive 3% Annual Growth in 13 Years: 5 Picks).The recent strength in the economy has offset trade war tensions. Needless to say, the United States and China have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s imports, with Beijing accusing the United States for triggering the ‘largest scale trade war’ (read more: Think Small As U.S.-China Trade War Breaks Out! 5 Top Picks).Potential Gainers of Q2The energy sector is poised to record highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 138.4% from the same period last year on 20.3% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A more or less healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily fueling the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q2 earnings expected to rise 54% on 24.1% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q2 earnings poised to be up 45% from the same period last year on 22.5% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 24.5% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand, while manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Q2 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 23.8% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. High profits are also expected from financial segments as well. Total Q2 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 18.4% from the same period last year on 3.8% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth mostly on higher interest rates (read more: Fed Lifts Rates for the Second Time in 2018: Winners & Losers).Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthA very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of stellar earnings growth in Q2.

2,BRK.B,"Now a literal household name, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has experienced meteoric growth since its May 1997 IPO, since which its stock price has soared an astounding 111,260%. This represents about hundred times more growth than any of its industry competitors over that same time frame. This year alone, Amazon is up nearly 43% compared to an industry average of 9.2%.With this much growth already baked into its stock price, many investors may feel that Amazon stock is too expensive and that they have missed their chance to cash in. Is this truly the case? Let’s take a look.An Ever-Expanding Sphere of InfluenceOur team reported on Thursday that shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) plummeted on news that Amazon would purchase online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move is part of the firm’s push into the $400 billion industry. While specific details have not yet been released, the idea is that the firm would sell prescription medicines online.This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into healthcare. The company announced in January that it, alongside Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), would begin “partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs.” The partnership will see the formation of an independent company, at which a top-level executive from each respective firm will take lead.Amazon also announced Delivery Service Partners on Thursday, a new program that is designed to let local entrepreneurs manage and operate delivery networks with up to 40 vans within their respective regions. The move puts firms like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) directly in their crosshairs. It said that the move would involve “hundreds” of small businesses and ultimately result in the hiring of “tens of thousands” of delivery drivers across the country.This week, Amazon began rolling out special deals for its Prime members to Whole Foods, which it acquired in August of last year. According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, this could double Whole Foods’ customer base. Amazon is also expanding Go, its cashier-free convenience store initiative which made its public debut in January of last year.Amazon’s sphere of influence is only continuing to expand. It is difficult to fathom that the same firm which at one point only sold books, now has a presence in retail, logistics, media production, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, just to name a few of its numerous ventures. What makes the company interesting is the fact that it continues to invest and expand into new territory, just as its recent news announcements have shown us.By the NumbersAmazon had a stellar earnings report in April, delivering first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.27 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.05 (168%) and representing 121% year-over-year growth. The company also reported $51.04 billion in revenue, beating our Consensus Estimate by almost a billion dollars and representing 43% in year-over-year growth.Product sales, which account for 61.9% of Amazon’s overall sales, increased 33.2% year-over-year to $31.61 billion, while service sales (which account for the other 38.1%) rose 62.2% year-over-year to $19.44 billion. This was driven largely by Amazon’s physical store presence through Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Physical store sales accounted for $7.46 billion in revenue compared to our $4.35 billion Consensus Estimate.The strong earnings report was also guided in part by strong performance in Amazon’s Web Services division (AWS), which saw revenues climb 48.6% year-over-year to $5.44 billion. The change was primarily driven by an expanding customer base, which included the addition of enterprise customers such as LG Electronics and Shutterfly (SFLY  -  Free Report). AWS now accounts for ~11% of Amazon’s total revenue and ~73% of its operating income, and holds a third of the global cloud computing services market.Investors should take note of Amazon’s 12-Month Forward P/E ratio of 101x, which is notably lower than its F1 2018 ratio of 130.4x. The ratio shifted dramatically in April, as analysts significantly raised their estimates on the back of the firm’s extremely strong earnings report.Investors may also notice that the aforementioned 12-Month Forward P/E of 101x still appears to hold a significant premium to the industry average of 23.7x. The reason why this is the case however, is because Amazon sacrifices profits in the short-term to fund its many different initiatives. This reduces earnings and thus inflates the ratio. This aggressive investment strategy is what has allowed Amazon to grow in such an explosive fashion. One good example is AWS, which was not immediately profitable as the firm created its infrastructure, but now represents one of its most lucrative divisions.The effects of Amazon’s investment strategy become clear when we look at the last five years of Amazon’s earnings estimate history, represented by the green line:Note that although earnings estimates for F1 2018 sat at $8.69 per share before April’s report, they currently sit at $12.74 per share. That Amazon’s estimates have continuously increased is a testament to analyst confidence that its various initiatives have not only already brought in results but will continue to do so.Here is another point that investors may find interesting:Although Amazon is burning through cash to fuel their operations, it has been increasing its margins consistently for the last six years. This is important because it tells us that Amazon is becoming more efficient at converting sales into actual profit. Once Amazon’s newer investments turn profitable, it will mean that Amazon can potentially continue to pull off earnings surprises as significant as last quarter’s 168% beat.OutlookAlthough investors may feel hesitant about Amazon’s current stock price, various signs point to it being warranted rather than overhyped. With a perpetually growing product portfolio, aggressive operations investment, and increasing margins, Amazon is positioning itself to dominate multiple industries at once for years to come.While nothing is certain, investors should remain aware of the possibility that should they attempt to wait for a better entry point to invest, it may never come. Regardless of if investors choose to purchase Amazon stock, they should continue to monitor its performance. As its various divisions continue to grow, an increasing number of firms will see their business models threatened.Amazon currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3,BRK.B,"There’s so much going on with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) right now that we can just hit the high spots now. These include a new CEO to head up its health insurance initiative, its physical expansion, its apartment house pickup service Hub and new skills for Alexa.Amazon & Banks Choose CEOAmazon’s ambition to crack healthcare or at least the insurance side of it through partnerships with leading banks took another step forward with the appointment of a CEO effective Jul 9. The Boston-based company will operate as an independent entity that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints with the goal of ensuring people take their prescriptions to thereby reduce health complications and cost. Healthier people will also be less of a burden for insurance companies.The person chosen for the job is Dr. Atul Gawande, a world famous surgeon, writer and public health innovator, specializing in general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He is also Professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, as well as founding executive director of the health systems innovation center, Ariadne Labs.“We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert’s knowledge, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation,” said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.“Atul embodies all three, and we’re starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor.” Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), and Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) had similar words of praise for the incoming CEO.Amazon Expansion and EmploymentWe can debate about whether Amazon’s operating cost will increase as it creates more of a physical presence because this will require real estate and a larger employee base. In fact this is one of the biggest disadvantages that traditional retailers have to deal with when compared with Amazon. Moreover, once you’re already employing a lot of people like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), it is relatively harder to automate operations because retrenchment will put you up against labor unions.Amazon is making the most of its position as a mainly online retailer by significantly automating operations and processes and employing as few people as possible. This is visible in its Amazon Go shop concept and also in its fulfillment centers.So its fourth Michigan fulfillment center in Gaines Township, which is an 850,000 square foot facility, will create just a 1,000 full time jobs. Similarly, the new Bessemer fulfillment center (the first of its kind in the state of Alabama), which is an 855,000 square foot facility will employ just 1,500 employees. These employees, who will work alongside robots to pick, pack and ship small items to customers such as books, household items and toys, will however be well taken care of in terms of wages and benefits.What’s more, it isn’t just the mundane jobs of the warehouses that are being automated. Over time, Amazon has even shifted tasks like forecasting demand, ordering inventory and negotiating prices to algorithms.Amazon says in a statement, “We’ve been working for some time on standardizing the products, tools and services we offer to the brands and resellers that sell on Amazon, and have made some organizational changes as a result.” It also says that it has more than 16,000 corporate jobs open worldwide and that it had created 130,000 jobs last year.So Amazon’s physical expansion may not be as good as it might have been in terms of employment, but it’s good nonetheless because of the rate of expansion.Hub by AmazonAmazon recently announced Hub by Amazon, which is essentially a package pickup location for apartment buildings. The service is available not only on Amazon packages but also from others like UPS, FedEx, or even the Post Office.  Delivery persons enter their code to drop off packages while residents enter their code to pick them up at any time 24/7. Amazon offers security for the packages and also personal assistance if required. The facility helps Amazon deliver packages for pickup within one day.  Amazon says that the service is already available to 500,000 residents from 30 such locations across the U.S. Big residential property owners and managers, collectively overseeing thousands of apartment properties like AvalonBay, Fairfield Residential, Pinnacle, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, WinnResidential and Equity Residential, have already signed up to use the service.This looks like a rather neat way to creep into the broader logistics business.Alexa Acquires More SkillsAlexa acquired a number of skills over the past week or so-First, through Alexa for Hospitality, she can serve guests asking for hotel information, guest services, music playback in their room and more. The goal is to improve guest experience while offering them the kind of voice services many are now accustomed to in their own homes. Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) was the first big hotel to adopt the technology, introducing the new Alexa experience at select properties in Marriott Hotels, Westin Hotels & Resorts, St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, Aloft Hotels, and Autograph Collection Hotels starting this summer.Designed by tech startup n-Powered, college students can now ask Alexa questions, such as when their classes are scheduled, how much cash remains on their food cards and how much they owe for tuition. Northeastern University will be offering its students Echo Dots through which the service will be available but it isn’t known yet what if anything it will charge them for it.  It should make life easier for students and save faculty time, so other colleges may go for similar programs as well.A voice-based, music education startup called Bamboo Learning has released an Alexa skill called Bamboo Music that will help students learn and practice music theory through voice and listening exercises. The company was founded by Amazon veteran Ian Freed, who was VP of Amazon devices from 2010 to 2015 and helped design the Alexa-enabled Echo.Users will now be able to get Alexa to set recordings, launch apps and navigate menus on the Dish Hopper range of set-top boxes.Private-LabelD A Davidson analyst Tom Forte raised his price target on the stock from $1,900 to $2,100, because of “the increase in our annual sales forecasts by 100 basis points, per year, due to our increased confidence in its ability to generate additional private-label and advertising revenues.""With private-label growing in importance at Amazon, Coresight Research, in partnership with DataWeave, recently aggregated data on 6,825 products across 74 identified Amazon private labels to study their progress. Coresight had the following observations:The bulk of Amazon private labels are apparel brands with many sub categories containing relatively few (around 100) products each as Amazon tries to cater to a broad cross section of people with targeted offerings. But other leading retail categories like food and beauty haven’t received the same attention. With the acquisition of Whole Foods, the company gained access to its food brands, which are listed on its site. It appears that Amazon will take a similar approach to food and beauty as it has with apparel.Its private label brands are also getting a boost with Amazon Prime Wardrobe that is now available to all U.S. users. The system allows you to select at least three and at most eight items that you have a week to try on and reject if necessary. Amazon says that its private label brands Lark & Ro, Daily Ritual, Amazon Essentials, and Goodthreads are the top-ordered items, which could just be because its own brands are more widely available on the service.CustomersAmazon has reported that online retailer zulily has been moving its business critical workloads to AWS, including its store, mobile application, and supply chain, as it leverages the cloud to serve customers better. The press release said that zulily has seen a 30-40% performance improvement per request made on its website and mobile app.  Meanwhile, Sears  has announced that the number of its Auto Centers accepting Amazon tire pickup and fixing has now been increased by 71 to total 118. Sears collects a small fee for the service.Facial Recognition IssueAmazon employees are protesting its marketing of face-recognition technology called rekognition to private businesses and law-enforcement agencies. An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) investigation earlier this month showed that Amazon has been selling such information to police in Florida and Oregon.The WSJ reports that in fact anyone with a credit card and an Amazon Web Services account can access it. There is also no approval process for consumers, who can be tracked just about anywhere there is a camera, even if they aren’t carrying any devices.According to a recently-published letter posted to an internal forum, employees who called themselves Amazonians said that “Our company should not be in the surveillance business; we should not be in the policing business; we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations.” It also objected to and called for the cessation of infrastructure service provision to Palantir, the Peter Thiel-backed surveillance company, which has ties to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department.Seattle Head Tax Battle WonBig companies won the battle against homeless people when the Seattle City Council repealed a newly enacted ""head tax"" on the its largest companies by a 7-2 vote. The tax would have impacted only the largest companies by revenue, Amazon being one. It was expected to hit 500 companies that would have been required to pay a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city to raise at least $45 million over five years. The money was to go toward affordable housing and support services for the homeless.Amazon was one of the most vociferous opposers, threatening to take its business to other states to avoid the tax. Since this trend would have led to unemployment, the state was forced to reconsider. Amazon promptly said it would support non-profits working for the homeless.Senators Question Echo PrivacyA recent controversy over the way an Echo device inadvertently recorded a conversation and even sent it to an unintended recipient have raised privacy questions around the device.U.S. Senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons have written to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos requesting information about the technical design and privacy features of Echo devices as well as the Alexa digital assistant platform. Flake is chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, and Coons is a member.Supreme Court Ruling Will Have Minimal ImpactIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has said that states can tax online companies. The existing law based on physical presence hasn’t however been nullified.Since Amazon already collects taxes in all states in which it operates and also charges a fee for taking on the hassle for sellers that want the service, the decision is a slight positive for the retail business.For buyers, cost of products on Amazon’s marketplace (not the stuff it sells directly) could go up if the concerned sellers aren’t collecting sales tax. However, since Amazon is also in the process of integrating its marketplaces business into the retail business, so any negative impact on this business will likely be small for Amazon.One-Month Pice ActionRecommendationAmazon shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

4,BRK.B,"The much talked about and widely speculated foray of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) into the healthcare space is shaping up, with the appointment of the CEO of their healthcare company.The three heavyweights formed a healthcare alliance early during the year and have been hunting for the best fit to helm its affairs. Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, will head the new company, to be based out of Boston, from Jul 9.Despite no prior background in running a healthcare company, the company will bank on Gawande’s analytical acumen to cope with issues plaguing the current healthcare practices in the United States. Per Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, Gawande possesses the qualities of “an expert’s knowledge, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation”Frustrated with soaring healthcare costs, the three companies have come together to primarily take care of the healthcare needs of more than a million of their employees.  Warren Buffett recently called healthcare cost ""the hungry tapeworm on the American economy.""  Amazon has, however, expressed interest in the pharmacy space also.The  new company will operate as an independent entity, free from profit-making incentives and constraints.The news of the possibility of these companies making an entry into healthcare space late last year sent shockwaves through the industry with the existing players fearing a disruption. Led by concerns of market share loss and a tough competitive environment that might be the beginning of a number of mergers and acquisitions have been announced and taken place since then, setting the trend of cross consolidation in the healthcare industry.Existing companies in the space are making all efforts to gain in size and scale to tightly hold on to their ground when the winds of change blow.Some of the deals in this vein are that of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation, Express Scripts by Cigna Corp., purchase of the primary care unit of DaVita by UnitedHealth Group Inc., Rite Aid’s merger with Albertson's, and Walgreens Boots Alliance partnership with Humana to set up primary care clinics. All these companies are seemingly doing their homework and getting ready to face the radical changes to be bought by the new comers.There is no doubt that the entry of these most influential companies (especially Amazon, which has successfully turned the tide in its favor in whatever business it has laid its hands on thus far) is a shot across the bow to the traditional healthcare system in the United States and could unsettle the industry. While the companies have come together to manage healthcare costs for their own employees, it would not come as a surprise if they start providing service to the public at large.These companies, with their established brands, huge customer data, cutting-edge technology and superior product and services, should lead to a radical healthcare transformation. It is expected that the solutions created by them will to a large extent solve the three main challenges of the healthcare sector — access, quality and cost.  A shift from “one-size-fits-all” care treatment to “tailor made care” should be in vogue, as these customer-centric companies try to design customer-specific products and services compared with traditional healthcare players that have hardly ever extended such care to customers.Considering the health insurance industry, which was concentrated on a handful of big players that command product pricing and service offerings, and had an upper hand in dealing with customers, will find themselves in a radically changed scenario. Players in this space have already had to make fundamental changes in their business operations and attitude since the enactment of Obamacare in 2010 that put a check on malpractices to protect customers’ interest. Now, the entry of players that are already well established in their own fields and enjoy customer loyalty, will give traditional healthcare players a jolt.It will, however, not be a cake walk for these new entrants to establish themselves very soon in the healthcare industry. The need of the hour for healthcare entities is razor-sharp focus on innovation and service to protect their share in a market that they have ruled for ages.Among the companies mention above, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Berkshire Hathaway carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

5,BRK.B,"The Federal Reserve lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signalled at a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy heated up and inflation crawled higher.With the Fed hiking rates and aiming for more increases this year, banks, insurers and brokerage firms stand to gain. Meanwhile, utilities, homebuilders and gold miners are likely to lose.Fed Gets Slightly More HawkishThe Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Eight of the 15 Fed officials said that they expect interest rates to increase at least four times this year, up from seven in the March Fed rate meeting. The Fed’s dot plot, in fact, indicated that policy makers predict two additional rate hikes this year for a total of four increases instead of three as planned earlier.By the end of this year, the median forecast for the federal funds rate stands at 2.4%, compared with the March forecast of 2.1%. Beyond this year, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee predicts that it will hike rates three times next year and one more time the following year to propel its benchmark rate up to 3.4%.Fed’s View on Economy & InflationThe Fed’s decision reflected an economy that is improving by the day. After all, the jobless rate is at its lowest since 2000, wages are going up and consumers are pretty confident. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment is low.” Lest we forget, for the first time in nearly 20 years, there are more job openings in the United States than workers to fill the positions.Fed officials also believe that the economy doesn’t require much help at the moment. Fed has removed the language that said the central bank expected federal funds rate “to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”Powell, in the meantime, added that the Fed is comfortable with the comeback of inflation. The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), has already touched the central bank’s 2% target during March and April. The Fed expects inflation to remain higher than 2% in the next two years. (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Beat the Fastest Rise in Inflation in 6 Years).Winners & Losers in a Rising Rate SettingWith the Fed raising interest rates and hinting at faster hikes, certain sectors stand to gain, while some sure have a lot at stake.Let’s take a look at the sufferers first –UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won’t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario. Utilities are capital intensive and funds generated from internal sources do not always meet requirements. Hence, these companies have towering debt loads. Low interest rates help them pay off debts and book profits.But higher rates along with an escalating debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.Home Construction Higher federal funds rate will make it more expensive for banks to borrow money, which eventually translates into higher borrowing rates for consumers. This is surely a dampener for real estate activities and losers, affecting construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.Mortgage rates are already on the rise. On average, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbed to 4.66% last month, the highest in seven years, before dropping slightly in recent weeks.GoldRising rates diminish the appeal of precious metals like gold because the commodity doesn’t offer yield as high as other safe haven assets like government bonds. Higher interest rates also boost the dollar and dent demand for dollar-denominated commodities.Following the Fed’s announcements, the ICE Dollar Index that measures the value of dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% to 93.898.Now, which areas are set to make the most of a rate hike? Of course, financials!BanksBanks are definitely the go-to rate trade now. As a rule, higher interest rates boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.National banks like the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are very rate-sensitive and have consistently seen earnings rise on a quarter-point rate hike.InsurersVery few companies root for a rate hike as much as those in the insurance industry. And why not? The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth.Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins.Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment.Asset ManagersBrokerage firms advantage significantly from an increasing rate environment since a hike in rates generally occurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Notably, a wealth management firm like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenues, much of which flows directly to pre-tax profits.Top 5 GainersGiven the aforesaid positives, we have selected five solid stocks from these winning areas that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).BankFinancial Corporation (BFIN  -  Free Report) operates as the holding company for BankFinancial, National Association that provides commercial, family, and personal banking products and services in Illinois.

It has amassed assets over $1.38 B, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.35%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 24.70% of the portfolio. Energy and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B (BRK.B  -  Free Report) accounts for about 3.53% of total assets, followed by Jpmorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 22.77% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSPYV seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Value Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value sector in the U.S. equity market.The ETF has lost about -1.19% so far this year and was up about 10.93% in the last one year (as of 05/23/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $28.05 and $32.54.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 12.99% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 390 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors.

7,BRK.B,"The Dow snapped a record streak of wins to traverse a turbulent week. Trade-war related concerns continued to weigh on investors with President Trump expressing doubts over the success of upcoming negotiations with China. Additionally, the spike in 10-year Treasury yield also spooked markets, sparking off fresh inflationary concerns. Such fears were also stoked by encouraging retail sales numbers.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.4% on last Friday, marking its seventh straight session of gains. This was the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Nov. 8, 2017. Notably, healthcare stocks were down initially following the news that President Trump unveiled his new healthcare plan.However, the broad market recovered later after the announcement was not followed up by stringent measures. Low inflation data and weak dollar also boosted investors’ confidence in equities.The index gained 2.3% over last week. This was the blue-chip index’s largest weekly gain since March. Energy and tech stocks were major drivers of the U.S. stock markets. Oil prices first rallied on last Wednesday in the wake of United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal. This increase fueled a rally in energy stocks once again.Meanwhile, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares jumped after celebrity investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) announced that it had bought 70 million shares of Apple in the first quarter. Consequently, shares of Apple rose to an all-time high $190.37.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.3% on Monday, increasing for the eighth consecutive session. This marked the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Sep. 20, 2017. Stocks gained on the first trading day of the week as trade fears subsided. President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that he was considering relaxing stringent sanctions that have been imposed on Chinese tech giant ZTE Corp. last month.The index lost 0.8% on Tuesday after the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note hit a seven-year high. This, in turn, occurred after retail sales increased over two consecutive months, raising inflationary fears. Moreover, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad commented that trade tensions between the United States and China were far from over.The index gained 0.3% on Wednesday reversing previous day’s broad-based decline. In particular, retail stocks gained on strong sales data of April and Macy’s Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings report. Moreover, Russell 2000, the benchmark index for small-cap stocks hits an all-time high. Overall, most stocks closed in the green as investors appeared to ignore concerns regarding rising yield on the U.S. government bonds and geopolitical tensions.The index lost 0.2% on Thursday after President Trump commented that trade talks between the United States and China may not be successful. Trump stated: “Will that be successful? I tend to doubt it,” ahead of the second round of trade talks between the two countries. Meanwhile, a decline in technology shares negated gains made by energy stocks.Components Moving the Index The Home Depot, Inc.

8,BRK.B,"While health insurers have managed to stand tall thesepast fewyears and the performance so far in 2018 has been commendable, some disruptive forces are underway in the industry that might alter the functioning of the organization and pose new challenges.Let’s take a look at some of the current happenings that might shake the industry.Will Foray of New Players Disrupt the Industry?Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) -- corporate czars in their respective fields--have teamed up to enter the healthcare market. While they have come together to manage healthcare cost for their employees, it would not come as a surprise if they start a healthcare company to provide services to the public at large.Amazon has already expressed interest in the pharmacy business. A lot of progress is being made on this joint venture. At Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, Buffett revealed that the joint venture will soon have a CEO to look after healthcare affairs.There is no doubt that the entry of these retailers (especially Amazon, which has successfully turned the tide in its favor in whatever business it has laid its hands on thus far) will widely unsettle the healthcare sector.These retailers, with their established brands, huge customer data, cutting-edge technology and superior product and services, should lead to a radical healthcare transformation. It is expected that the solutions created by them will to a large extent solve the three main challenges of the healthcare sector — access, quality and cost.  A shift from “one-size-fits-all” care treatment to “tailor made care” should be in vogue, as these customer-centric companies try to design customer-specific products and services compared with traditional healthcare players that have hardly ever extended such care to customers.Considering the health insurance industry, which was concentrated with a handful of big players that command product pricing and service offerings, and had an upper hand in dealing with customers, will find themselves in a radically changed scenario. Players in this space have already had to make fundamental changes in their business operations and attitude since the enactment of Obamacare in 2010 that put a check on malpractices to protect customers’ interest. Now, the entry of players that are already well established in their own fields and enjoy customer loyalty, will give the traditional healthcare players a jolt.The need of the hour for healthcare entities is razor-sharp focus on innovation and service to protect their share in a market that they have ruled for ages. What’s more, they must do so to save their space from retail invasion.What Does the Individual Mandate Repeal Mean for Insurers?In December, Obamacare’s Individual Mandate, which required most Americans to be covered under a health insurance or to pay a fine, was stripped off, as part of the tax reform act. This provision will no longer be in effect from 2019. This policy change might lead to healthy individuals opting to remain uninsured only to buy an insurance cover when sick. This should lead to an adverse change in customer mix with insurers getting sick customers mostly, which might increase their risk pool and cause high claim incidence.Insurers have been lobbying against this repeal fearing its unfavorable outcome. This might also destabilize the public exchanges where more sick customers would flock to buy insurance, causing an increase in insurance premium, or lead the insurance companies to exit from exchanges, if the business doesn’t look sustainable. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has stated that repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate would cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027. This implies an increase in the uninsured rate, which is inversely proportional to insurers’ earnings growth.Tough Regulatory Oversight to PrevailMergers and consolidation are rife in the sector, triggered by the changing industry environment, which calls for the business to growbig in size in order to command the market and remain a leader. And the best way for insurers to achieve this status is to go for mergers and acquisitions.However, this will not be easy to come by, given that regulators will not spare any chance to strip down a deal, which would go against the interest of consumers and throttle competition. Thus, the ride may not be easy for insurers on this front.Margins to Stay Under PressureMinimum MLR rebate requirements limit the level of margin insurers’ can earn in their Commercial Insured, Medicare Insured and Medicaid Insured businesses while leaving them exposed to higher-than-expected medical costs. This has kept health insurers’ margins under pressure lately, a trend that will likely continue in the coming quarters. A host of factors —including compliance costs related to health care reform regulation, increased fees and taxes, pricing pressure, stiff competition and rising medical costs — are also inplay in compressing margins.The industry is also witnessing a general shift in patient mix from commercial insurance to government (Medicare, Medicaid and State-subsidized marketplace or exchange) which is another major dampener of insurers’ profitability. Premiums for Medicare, Medicaid and state-subsidized policies tend to be higher due to serious health issues for many enrollees. However, they carry smaller profitability margins compared to commercial insurance.To Sum UpContinued uncertainty will cast a shadow on the industry in the near term. Insurers will have to constantly take stock of their business workings to build a resilient enterprise. This will require an increased amount of investment and talent. Players can only emerge as winners when they act proactively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

9,BRK.B,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) shares jumped over 11% in the past week. Let’s see what’s driving the optimism:Amazon Stops Buying Google Shopping AdsMarketing firm Merkle noticed late last month that Amazon ads stopped appearing on the Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Shopping platform. Amazon subsidiaries like Zapoz however continue to advertise on the platform.Google has said that periodic adjustments in ad campaigns are not unheard of while people connected with Amazon have confirmed on condition of anonymity that the company has in fact stopped advertising there.Maybe we are reading too much into it, but since Amazon spends an estimated $50 million a year on the platform, this could be worth analyzing...The most obvious reason forwarded by analysts is that Amazon could be turning focus to its own advertising business, so making money for Google while it tries to take share from it may not make sense any more. Amazon’s own comments on its earnings call regarding the very strong growth in its advertising business supports this theory.This could also be a continuation or escalation of the showdown between the two companies. Amazon earlier removed Chromecast from its marketplace and Google removed YouTube from Amazon devices in retaliation.Alexa Building Healthcare ChopsCNBC reports that according to internal documents seen by its reporters, Amazon is building a healthcare division within Alexa to obtain HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance with particular focus on diabetes management, maternity and pediatrics, and geriatrics.Rachel Jiang who has varied experience at the company will be leading the effort. Missy Krasner, who joined Amazon last year after helping Box attain HIPAA compliance, will be responsible for business development and strategy. Other members of the team are Larry Ockene who has worked as engineer at Amazon for the last 10 years and Yvonne Chou who has taken various roles across Prime, fashion and retail.The healthcare market is complex and highly regulated so Amazon is rightly taking it a step at a time. Its past efforts include a collaboration with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) to encourage developers to make apps (Alexa skills) for diabetes management; a special team within AWS dedicated to health and pharmaceutical companies; and a joint initiative with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) to improve patient outcomes while reducing cost for insurers and employers.According to Transparency Market Research, the digital health market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.4% between 2017 and 2025, to reach$536.6 billion by the end of 2025. HIPAA compliance will facilitate sharing and uploading of patient data on Alexa-enabled devices and take Amazon that much closer to taking its share of this market.Jeff Bezos says, “Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation.” So that is going to be Amazon’s approach for sure.Amazon Experience CentersAmazon has tied up with home builder Lennar to convert model homes from the company into Amazon experience centers, i.e. homes in which customers can have Alexa operate thermostats, lights, shades, locks and televisions with simple voice commands. The goal is to showcase how Alexa operates. So even if you aren’t buying a Lennar home, you can buy the Amazon devices to convert your home into a smart one powered by Alexa.Lennar communities in Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington already have Amazon experience centers and the companies haven’t said if more locations will be added later. Lennar earlier had a similar arrangement with Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Siri that likely didn’t go down that well. It has now gone all in with Alexa.Amazon Sears DealSears Holdings  shares soared on the announcement of a deal with Amazon that will see it offering tire installation services for orders booked on Amazon. The services will extend to all brands and not just its own DieHard brand. The service will initially be available to all customers in eight metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. that say they want to have their tires shipped to one of the 47 Sears Auto Centers in these regions.The service will eventually be extended to all its 400+ Auto Centers across the U.S.The relationship between the two has been growing over the past year ever since Sears started selling its Kenmore branded home appliances on Amazon and then later added DieHard batteries.Sears has seen a sharp decline in sales over the past few years and has been closing down a large number of stores. There’s some doubt about whether the company will even be able to continue as a going concern. So any deal like this that is likely to send customers to its stores, even if they are well satisfied Amazon customers, is something investors cheer. But this may just be en route to selling off its entire business to Amazon…who knows, right? RecommendationsAmazon shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

10,BRK.B,"Who doesn’t want to follow investment strategies of billionaire investor Warren Buffett? Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B has added more than 78% over the last five years (as of May 15, 2018), better than the 64.4% gain of the broader market ETFSPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report).Notably, Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing disclosing the first-quarter stock holdings has shown some major changes. Below we highlight those alterations in portfolios so that retail investors can bank on some winning ETF and stock investment strategies.Buffett is All About Apple Buffett is outright bullish on Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Berkshire has the highest stake in the 13F portfolio at 21.27%. After raising his stake in Apple by 23.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, he added 75 million more shares of Apple in the quarter. Berkshire Hathaway now owns about 4.9% of the outstanding shares of Apple.Investors interested in following Buffett and being part of Apple’s growth story can play ETFs like iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report), Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT  -  Free Report) (read: Why You Should Believe in Buffett & Bet on These Apple ETFs).Treat Teva NicelyBerkshire more than doubled its holdings in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited TEVA to 40 million shares during the first quarter of 2018. Teva has about 16% weight in iShares MSCI Israel ETF (EIS  -  Free Report) and 5.4% in VanEck Vectors Generic Drugs ETF (GNRX  -  Free Report).Make Money With MonsantoBerkshire reported the addition of 7.3 million shares of Monsanto in the first quarter, reaching the total to 19 million shares. ETFs like iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI  -  Free Report), First Trust Indxx Global Agriculture ETF FTAG, Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF ( (XLB  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF MOO have substantial weights in Monsanto. While VEGI has about 14.3% exposure to Monsanto, other ETFs have 8.1% to 10.1%.Dump IBMBerkshire left IBM after cutting its stake in the company. Per an article published on CNBC, Buffett last year said ""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too"" (read: Invest Like Warren Buffett With These ETFs).So, investors following Buffett may carefully handle the likes of First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV  -  Free Report) as the fund has about 7.4% weight in IBM. But the fund has other strong candidates like Apple (which takes about 8.5% of the fund) (read: Should You Buy the Dip in IBM With ETFs?).Steer Clear of General MotorsBerkshire offloaded stakes in General Motors (GM  -  Free Report).  For General Motors, the stake declined to around $1.8 billion from about $2 billion.

11,BRK.B,"Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) has received the Federal Reserve’s approval for buying back an additional $5 billion worth of common shares by Jun 30, 2018. This is over and above the $12 billion of repurchase authorization that the company had received in June as part of its 2017 capital plan.The repurchase of extra shares will help the company offset the impact of the additional common stock that was issued when Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) exercised its outstanding warrants. Berkshire Hathaway converted the warrants that it had acquired after the financial crisis into BofA’s shares in August 2017.Additionally, this capital distribution will mitigate the increase in regulatory capital that resulted from the sale of BofA’s non-U.S. consumer credit card business.As part of its efforts toward transforming into “a single-brand business serving core retail customers in the United States”, BofA divested its U.K. consumer credit card operations, MBNA Ltd. to Lloyds Banking Group plc (LYG  -  Free Report) earlier this year, which enhanced its Basel 3 risk-based capital ratios.BofA’s repurchase program includes both common stock as well as warrants. The company mentioned that the buyback can take place either through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.Given a robust capital position and lower dividend payout ratio compared to its peers, the company is expected to sustain its capital deployment activities, thereby continuing to enhance shareholder value.Another company from the same space, which has a solid capital and balance sheet position, is Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report). Its 2017 capital plan includes share repurchase authorization worth $15.6 billion.BofA’s shares have gained 30.9% so far this year, outperforming the 18.2% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

12,BRK.B,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) continues to find favor with Warren Buffett. Per a recent regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Buffett led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) disclosed that it has increased its stake in Apple in the third quarter of 2017.Berkshire revealed in the filing that it has bought around 3.9 million of Apple shares, taking its total share count to over 134 million.Berkshire has been raising its stake in the tech giant, ever since it made its first investment in May 2016. The firm had bought around 9.8 million of Apple shares at a price of $109 per share back then.Buffett is a value investor as he mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment. His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and a capable management.Given this, Buffett has shied away from most technology companies, given the difficulty to understand the businesses. He so far has restricted himself to buying Apple and IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) stock.However, subsequent to the rise in stake in Apple, Berkshire lowered its stake in IBM by 32% in the third quarter. Per Seeking Alpha, at the close of third-quarter 2017, in terms of magnitude, Berkshire’s top holdings were Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz, Apple, Coca-Cola and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report).Notably, shares of Apple have gained 48% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 46.9% rally.Why is Buffett Interested in Apple?Apple commands a strong user base with exceptional brand loyalty. It is widely perceived that Apple users refuse to switch to any other platform that isn’t running on iOS.Moreover, per 24/7 Wall St. “100 Most Valuable Brands In The World” list, Apple is the most valuable brand in the world. We believe that no Android product enjoys such brand loyalty.We note that Apple’s brand is something that gives it an edge over its competitors. Per Seeking Alpha, “Brand strength allows Apple to charge higher prices and enjoy higher margins for its 'premium' product.”Reportedly, Apple’s spectacular results in the last quarter were backed by steady iPhone sales (higher average selling price was a big factor) along with a spurt in Services segment and a resurgent Macs and iPad business.Notably, Apple returned about $11 billion through dividends and share repurchases in the last reported quarter. The company returned $234 billion to shareholders out of its $300 billion capital return program.Moreover, Apple on its last conference call, declared a quarterly dividend of 63 cents per share, payable on Nov 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of Nov 13. When Berkshire made its first investment in the company, Apple’s quarterly dividend was 57 cents per share.Apple also provided a very encouraging outlook for the current quarter, which includes the holiday season, anticipating strong performance of its latest smartphone — iPhone X.TechCrunch was quoted citing Canalys’s data that Apple has bypassed China’s Xiaomi to once again become the world’s top wearable producer, following the September launch of its third-generation Apple Watch.However, stiff competition from cheaper Chinese handsets remains an overhang.Apple Inc.

15,BRK.B,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.73%. Let’s see. how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterBerkshire Hathaway has likely reported a decline in operating earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to lower operating earnings from Insurance Operations as well as Finance & Financial Products. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.88, reflecting a noticeable decline of 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Also, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer has likely witnessed weak underwriting results due to the significantly higher catastrophe losses arising from the unprecedented hurricane activity occurring during the third quarter. This will not only impact the underwriting profitability of the company but also render volatility to the P&C insurer’s earnings.However, the company’s Railroad, Utilities and Energy units have likely witnessed a rise in operating revenues, driven by a higher contribution from both BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. In addition, the segment has possibly displayed improved net earnings in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, driven by increased earnings from the railroad as well as energy businesses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Berkshire Hathaway is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Berkshire Hathaway has an Earnings ESP of -9.33%.

16,BRK.B,"Who doesn’t want to get as lucky as Warren Buffett in the investment world? Since Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s (BRK.B  -  Free Report) inception, the holding company has yielded a stellar return of nearly 21%.Buffett’s investing style has always remained simple: buy shares in great companies and hold them for a significant period of time. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time. They also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Such companies tend to come from sectors such as financials, technology, and consumer discretionary. The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates is already providing the much-needed windfall to financial service providers, as well as computer and software makers.Things have been looking up for consumer stocks as well.  A record low jobless rate and a series of highs for the stock market has buoyed optimism on household finances and the economy. Lest we forget, the Dow Jones had touched 23,000 in intraday trade for the first time on Oct 17. The blue-chip gauge, in fact, logged its fourth 1,000-point climb over the past 12 months, the most it has ever posted in a calendar year.Thus, let us focus on the Oracle of Omaha’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Trump Tax PlanThe tax code hasn't been refurbished since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan, along with a divided Congress, broadened the tax base and lowered marginal tax rates.Recently, the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for the much awaited tax code rewrite.  Such a tax cut would include trimming the business tax rate to 20% from 35%.The lowering of the domestic tax rate will result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This should, ultimately, boost the economy and drive interest rates. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Non-banking financial institutions should gain immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally occurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Moreover, big companies from the tech sector also have massive overseas cash piles. Bringing back funds held overseas will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and get involved in M&A activities.The tax plan aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25%, and 35%. The current top rate is 39.6%. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force in the continued strength of big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest in such bellwethers. Confidence in US Economy Highest in 13 YearsThe U.S. consumer sentiment index, in the meantime, touched 101.1 in October, up from 95.1 in September, as per the University of Michigan’s findings.  This key economic indicator, which measures attitudes on future economic prospects, scaled its highest level since 2004.Americans think the economic scenario right now is “as good as it gets.” The index for the current economic condition rose to 116.4 from 111.7. The U.S. economy is already growing close to the range projected by the White House, while the manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month.Investors’ sentiments were buoyed by narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and a rebound in exports in August from July. This is quite encouraging, as analysts had feared that hurricanes might affect trade data in August, with exports delayed due to storms.Household optimism was largely driven by underlying strength in the labor market. A clearer view of last month’s labor market data, in fact, showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, the U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten.The unemployment rate declined to 4.2%, the lowest since February 2001, while wages increased 0.5% to average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and in line with a post-recession high.4 Warren Buffet Stocks to Consider Ahead of Q3 EarningsAs mentioned above, American business magnate Warren Buffet’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. Banking on such positives, it will be prudent to invest in four of his favorite stocks from the aforementioned sectors that are expected to report a significant uptick in Q3 earnings.These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP.

17,BRK.B,"The financial sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately. With developments in President Donald Trump’s tax reform plan and odds of another rate hike to end this year increasing, financials stocks have been rallying.Cause for AppealRepublican leaders unveiled a tax reform plan aimed at reducing taxes for the corporate and also individuals. Although still in its early stages, it has increased investor optimism about hopes of tax cuts and deregulation (read: Treasury ETFs Weaken in the Wake of Tax Talk and Fed Chief Rumors).Moreover, in its latest September meeting, the Federal Reserve held on to rates. However, it hinted at chances of a rate hike in the December meeting. The current probability of a December rate hike of 25 basis points is 76.7%, per the CME Fed watch tool.Adding to the rally, the current favorite to lead the Fed, Kevin Warsh, is seen as a friend of the administration who is expected to expedite the process of deregulation and further rate hikes if he assumes the position currently held by Janet Yellen (see all Financials ETFs here).iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Financials Index. It has AUM of $1.98 billion and charges a moderate fee of 44 basis points a year.

The fund has returned 33.6% in a year and 11.0% year to date (as of Oct 2, 2017). VFH currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineVFH is more popular than IYF, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, it also may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  It also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, both the funds have had relatively similar year to date performance. IYF returned a mere 0.2% more than VFH so far this year whereas in a year, VFH clearly outperformed IYF. With growing developments in the sector, these ETFs are poised to offer great growth potential. However, since the factors driving growth in this sector is still in its early stages, a better-ranked ETF like VFH might help alleviate some of the political uncertainties prevailing in the region.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Fidelity Investments, Wellington Management and JPMorgan Chase & Co. sold 21 million shares, 9.8 million shares and 8.7 million shares, respectively.This is exactly opposite to what the “Oracle of Omaha” Warren Buffett is doing with the stock. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) recently bought an additional 75 million shares of the iPhone-maker worth between $11 billion and $14 billion, making it the third largest shareholder.Buffett told CNBC that “Apple is an unbelievable company” and he thinks that “it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States.”Notably, Apple shares have returned 11.2% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming S&P 500’s increase of 1.8%.  Institutional Investors versus BuffettInstitutional investors’ skepticism around Apple can primarily be attributed to growing concern over iPhone demand. However, Buffett seems to be less concerned about the short-term weakness in iPhone sales.Notably, iPhone unit sales of 52.2 million in the recently concluded second-quarter fiscal 2018 were less than disappointing and it increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. Double-digit growth in several markets including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam was a tailwind.Moreover, revenues from iPhone (62.2% of sales) grew 14% from the year-ago quarter to $38.03 billion. The upside can be attributed to higher iPhone average selling price (ASP), which increased to $728 from $655 a year ago. Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. Quote More importantly the stickiness of iPhone is playing a significant role in expanding Apple’s services business. Services — including revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services — increased 31% year over year and 8% sequentially.Moreover, Apple currently has a Value Style Score of B, which reflects the stock is undervalued.Zacks Rank & Other StocksCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"
21,BRK.B,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) reported okayish results, but investors heaved a sigh of relief when iPhone demand turned out to be less disappointing than anticipated, especially given Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSM  -  Free Report) warning earlier on. And as in past earnings announcements, management continued to point to its services business that grew strong double digits and the installed base of iPhones (people who could be convinced to buy more services/entertainment from Apple in the future). There was also the big $100 billion share buyback announcement that captured headlines and won Warren Buffett’s heart.Here’s some other Apple news from the past week or so-Apple, Goldman Sachs Team UpApple and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) are getting together to bring more financing options to consumers. For Apple, it is essentially replacing Barclays with Goldman Sachs in the co-branded credit card that’s linked to Apple Pay. For Goldman, it’s a chance to enter a market dominated by Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) by partnering with a very well-known consumer brand.Apple’s reasons for choosing Goldman are unclear given the company’s lack of experience in the area and since none of the companies are commenting on the media report. But it could have something to do with a lower payout as it strives to maintain profitability in a sluggish smartphone market.For Goldman, the advantages are more obvious because the company needs to break out into consumer finance as other areas of the business aren’t doing too well right now.The big question here is of course the changing consumer behavior because millennials and younger are loath to spend more as they have seen the effect of high debts on personal balance sheets as a result of extravagant and unnecessary spending necessitated by the great American dream. They are, on the other hand, keener on discounts, rewards, offers and so on. And that’s where the market is really competitive.So it’s a start -- let’s see where the partnership goes.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Can’t Have Enough AppleThe billionaire investor has revealed that in the last first quarter of 2018, he bought an additional 75 million shares of Apple for $12-13 billion, taking his total stake in the company to 240.3 million shares worth around $42.5 billion.Apple also took advantage of softer pricing amid broader weakness to spend more than $23 billion on its own shares at an average price of $171.48.At the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffet used creative analogies to support his decision. For example, ""Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year…They buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years."" So people shouldn’t be too concerned about the short term softness in iPhone sales. People should instead look at the ""extremely sticky"" products that attract customers and keep them coming back for more.Buffett generally doesn’t have an appetite for technology stocks and his IBM holdings admittedly didn’t meet expectations, leading him to offload the shares earlier this year.But the bet on Apple seems to be more because Apple is growing into more of a consumer products company (with some great technology behind it). It does all the things that Buffett likes: sells a sticky product, earns a huge profit (""If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States,"" he told CNBC), pays a dividend and buys back shares (""I love the idea of having our 5%, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7% without our laying out a dime."")This is also Berkshire’s first major investment/acquisition in two years.Whatever be the reasons for the investment, there’s no doubt that it’s a big vote of confidence for Apple. No wonder the shares bounced back quickly.Apple Rethinks Ireland Data CenterApple has shelved plans to construct an 850 million euro (743 million pounds) data center in Western Ireland to take advantage of the green energy sources in the region. The data center would have employed up to 300 people. The reason for the decision change was cited as delays in the plan approval process. In this case, a couple of environmentalists objected to the structure by taking the matter to court.When the High Court ruled in its favor, the decision was appealed at the Supreme Court. However, this was too much of a delay for Apple, which is seeing rapid growth in its EU business, so the company announced its withdrawal ahead of the Supreme Court’s ruling. The Irish government is now in the process of amending its planning laws to include data centers in the list of strategic infrastructure. This is expected to speed up the approval and legal process involved.   Apple isn’t withdrawing from Ireland, however, and has plans of expanding its European headquarters in County Cork where it already employs over 6,000 people.Apple Going Green on AluminumApple is offering a group including Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto and the governments of Canada and Quebec $10 million plus technical support to set up a JV called Elysis. The governments will contribute $47 million each while the two companies will together contribute $43 million plus intellectual property. 3.5% of the JV will be owned by Quebec with the rest split evenly between Alcoa and Rio Tinto. Apple and the government of Canada aren’t taking ownership stakes for their investment.Elysis is developing a new aluminum extraction process to be called elysis that won’t emit any greenhouse gases, or so the parties claim. The process will use a new unnamed advanced conducting material instead of carbon that will release oxygen instead of carbon dioxide.The technology needed to retrofit existing smelters or build new, greener ones is expected to be ready for sale by 2024.Apple uses a boatload of aluminum in all its products, so responsible sourcing can help it achieve its clean energy goals. And it doesn’t hurt to be ahead of the pack while it’s at it. RecommendationsApple shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

26,BRK.B,"Tech has hit a purple patch, largely backed by Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Apple’s shares recorded the biggest weekly gain in six-and-a-half years and also the highest five-day price gain in its history on May 4 after Warren Buffett’s company loaded up on the iPhone maker.Given the tech rally sparked by Buffett’s purchase of Apple shares, investing in sound tech companies seems judicious. Also, tech companies are well positioned to register double-digit growth this earnings season which makes it a great bargain.Apple Ends at a Record After Buffett Raises StakeWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) bought 75 million shares of Apple in the first quarter. This was in addition to the 165.3 million Apple shares that Berkshire owned at the end of last year. The recent buyout puts Apple among Berkshire’s largest holding, surpassing its stake in Wells Fargo.Buffett told CNBC that “Apple is an unbelievable company” and he thinksthat “it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States.” He added, “over the last year we’ve bought more Apple than anything else.”Apple had reported net income of $13.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, up from $11 billion a year ago. Chief Executive Tim Cook further added that revenues in all four geographical regions have improved, with more than 20% growth in Greater China and Japan.The Cupertino-based tech giant’s shares popped 3.9% following Buffett’s bet on Apple, bringing its week-to-date advance to 13.3%, the biggest five-day percentage gain since October 2011.

In fact, the bellwether tech name led the broader tech rally. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) jumped 1.9% on May 4, the highest among all the S&P 500 sectors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished in the positive territory for the week, up 1.3%.The recent tax cut has already given the much needed windfall to tech earnings, while cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data remain growth areas. Tech earnings in the first quarter, largely, continue to be stronger than expected, with total earnings till now up 29.6% from the same period last year on 12% higher revenues. Notably, 90.9% has beat EPS estimates and 93.2% revenue estimates (read more: Is the Earnings Picture Really That Strong?).Tech is Having a Great Earnings SeasonAnd if you look at the tech behemoths, they have put up a spectacular show.

The Redmond-based company posted revenues of $26.82 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, both of which have topped the consensus estimate.Netflix subscriber growth, in the meanwhile, breezed past estimates and Google somehow managed to stay afloat — thanks to a change in accounting policy.

27,BRK.B,"Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) surged more than 2.4% in early morning trading Friday, defying industry volatility that saw tech behemoths Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) open lower. Apple appears to be gaining on the back of news that Warren Buffett has added even more shares of the iPhone maker.Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) bought 75 million shares of Apple stock during the first quarter of 2018, the CEO told CNBC on Friday. The Omaha, Nebraska-based giant now holds roughly 240 million Apple shares.“It's an amazing business,” Buffett said. “You can put all their products on a dining room table. That's not the way it used to be in this country. It's incredible to me.”Buffett is in Omaha for Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting, where the latest Apple purchase will be disclosed on Saturday. The new addition represents a 45% increase to Berkshire’s stake in the consumer electronics bellwether.Shrugging off concerns that Apple missed smartphone unit sales estimates in its most recent quarter, Buffett explained that spending time trying to guess how many iPhone X devices were sold in a three-month period “totally misses the point” of the stock.The investing icon also said that Apple is an “unbelievable company” and pointed out that it makes more profit that any other U.S. corporation.Buffett’s bullishness mirrors a similar uptick in analyst sentiment for Apple. In just the past week, the company has witnessed seven positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, lifting the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents in that time. Analysts now expect Apple to report earnings growth of 24.1% this fiscal year.Still, one negative revision within the past few days has kept Apple at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock does, however, stick out in our Style Scores system with its “B” grades in the Value and Momentum categories.With Friday’s early gains, Apple is now up 6% on the year and is just 1.5% off its all-time high. Meanwhile, shares are trading at just 15.5x forward 12-month earnings, and its PEG of 1.3 implies that investors are also getting a great price for its growth prospects.It makes sense that a notorious value investor like Warren Buffett would love Apple right now, but investors looking to ride trends and follow analyst movement might also be a fan of the iPhone maker.Want more market analysis from this author?

28,BRK.B,"Investors have preferred defensive sectors like utilities or other high yielding securities over the past few months, given heightened volatility and uncertainty despite a soaring stock market. The trend may reverse as the Fed’s latest move will lead to rotation from these sectors into financials, technology, industrials, and consumer discretionary (read: Utilities ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs Amid Market Turmoil).This is especially true given that the Fed has turned hawkish and will start unwinding its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet next month. It has also hinted at one more rate hike by the end of this year with three lifts-off in store for 2018.Higher Rates: Pros & ConsHigher rates tend to reflect stronger economic conditions and lower the risk of deflation, making many corners of the market tempting to investors. A strong economy is likely to boost capital spending, which should bode well for information technology and industrial sectors. The financial sector will likely benefit from a higher interest rate spread while consumers will also see a boost if the dollar stays strong. Moreover, an improving economy coupled with surging stock market will continue to add wealth effect, resulting in rising consumer confidence.Higher rates will attract more capital to the country from foreign investors, thereby boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies. However, this would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, reflecting that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates (read: 5 Hot Global Dividend ETFs).Further, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom will be impacted by higher rates. Higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn hurt profitability across various segments.How to Play?While there are number of ETFs to tap sector rotation, we have highlighted four funds that are popular and has a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).  Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This is the most popular financial ETF in the space with AUM of $25.6 billion and average daily volume of nearly 68.2 million shares. The fund follows the Financial Select Sector Index, holding 69 stocks in its basket with double-digit allocation to the top two firms - Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report). In terms of industrial exposure, banks take the top spot at 44% while capital markets, insurance, and diversified financial services make up for double-digit exposure each. The fund charges 14 bps in annual fees (read: ETF Investing Lessons from Warren Buffett).Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -  Free Report)This most popular technology ETF follows the Technology Select Sector Index and has $17.8 billion in AUM. The fund charges 14 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of more than 10.3 million shares a day on average. It holds about 75 securities in its basket with higher concentration on the top two firms – Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) – that accounts for a combined 25.5% of the assets. In terms of industrial exposure, the fund is widely spread across software, Internet software & services, hardware storage & peripherals, IT services, and semiconductors that make up for a double-digit allocation each.Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI  -  Free Report)This is the most popular ETF in the industrial space with AUM of $10.5 billion and an average daily volume of more than 9.2 million shares. The fund follows the Industrial Select Sector Index, holding 70 stocks in its basket with each accounting for less than 6.8% of the assets. About one-fourth of the assets is allocated to aerospace & defense while industrial conglomerates, and machinery make up for a double-digit share each. This ETF charges 14 bps in fees per year (read: 5 Solid Reasons to Buy Industrial ETFs Now).Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR  -  Free Report)This fund follows the MSCI U.S. Investable Market Consumer Discretionary 25/50 Index and holds 375 stocks in its basket with heavy concentration on Amazon (AMZN) at 12.5%. Internet & direct marketing retail, cable & satellite, and movies & entertainment are the top three sectors accounting for a double-digit exposure each.

29,BRK.B,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, after the market closes. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 23.73%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Berkshire Hathaway is likely to report bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by better-than-expected performance across all segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.01, reflecting a noticeable improvement of 39.6% from the year-ago quarter.Also, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate from 35% to 21%, has likely boosted the company’s bottom line and driven its margin expansion.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer is expected to have witnessed higher revenues as well as earnings at its Manufacturing, Service and Retailing segment owing to greater consumer demand and a favorable performance across other units.The company’s Railroad, Utilities and Energy units have probably witnessed a rise in operating revenues, driven by a stronger contribution from both Burlington Northern SantaFe Corp. (BNSF) and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. In addition, the segment has possibly displayed improved net earnings in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, driven by an estimated increase in earnings from the railroad as well as energy businesses.Also, strategic buyouts and investments are anticipated to have aided the company’s performance in the last completed quarter.Being a P&C insurer, Berkshire Hathaway has perhaps incurred catastrophe loss due to unpredictable weather-related events in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. This in turn is expected to render volatility to the company’s underwriting results.  Also, the company might have suffered escalated costs and expenses, primarily due to increasing cost of sales, operating expense as well as depreciation and amortization. This rise in expenses is likely to restrict the operating margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall profitability in turn.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Quote What the Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Berkshire Hathaway is likely to beat on earnings this to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Berkshire Hathaway has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.01. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Berkshire Hathaway carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:National General Holdings Corp. (NGHC  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on May 7. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +5.59% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Banco Macro S.A. (BMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.

It has amassed assets over $1.21 B, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.39%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 24.70% of the portfolio. Energy and Consumer Staples round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B (BRK.B  -  Free Report) accounts for about 3.63% of total assets, followed by Jpmorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 22.97% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSPYV seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Value Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Value Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization value sector in the U.S. equity market.The ETF has lost about -3.12% so far this year and was up about 8.20% in the last one year (as of 04/25/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $27.63 and $32.54.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 12.97% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 391 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SPYV is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Value ETF has $35.75 B in assets, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.33 B. VTV has an expense ratio of 0.06% and IWD charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

31,BRK.B,"It’s been 13 years of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime membership service. Now, the service has reached 100 million subscribers after adding more members in 2017 than in any other year. Amazon had shipped more than 5 billion items last year.CEO Jeff Bezos did update investors on a number of key milestones in his annual letter to shareholders, but, market pundits said that Prime subscriber numbers were the most encouraging. In fact, the total count of Amazon Web Services active users, including the Prime numbers, was up 250% last year.Amazon Web Services currently has nearly $20 billion in annual revenues. The company acknowledged 2017 as the best year for hardware sales. Among the products, the Echo range of devices was a bestseller. Amazon also created more than 130,000 jobs last year.GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives said that Bezos will increase outlays by another 20% this year banking on Prime subscribers’ growth, and is on path for stronger-than-expected organic growth in 2018.Here’s How HBO, Netflix and Tinder CompareWhile the Prime subscriber count is ticking up by the minute, let’s see how the number compares to those of other subscription services?Compared to Amazon Prime, HBO and Netfix have more subscribers throughout the globe at 142 million and 125 million, respectively. On the other hand, subscription businesses including Spotify, Hulu and Tinder have fewer global subscribers at 71 million, 17 million and 3 million users, in that order.Burgeoning Retail BusinessAs per Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Amazon is positioned to capture the next wave of online retail. Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market last year and is aiming to expand its fresh food offerings. At the same time, it is trying to succed in harder-to-deliver categories like apparels through its Prime Wardrobe segment.Credit Suisse, in the meantime, has raised its 12-month target price on Amazon to $1,800 from $1,750 on Apr 20 after it noted meaningful revenue growth on flourishing segments like Amazon Web Services and online retail.What If You Bet $1,000 on Amazon 10 Years Ago?Amazon’s success, in part, explains why Bezos’ net worth is just shy of $130 billion. In fact, your investment of $1,000 in 2008 would now be $19,300, or more than 19 times including price uptick and dividend gains reinvested, per CNBC calculations.Warren Buffett, chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) admitted that he didn’t realise the value of Amazon at first. He underestimated the brilliance of Bezos’ execution and went on to say that Bezos is the “most remarkable business person of our age.”Amazon Stock VerdictWhile Amazon’s high-profile membership service set a milestone, its central retail business is expected to gain steadily this year. Amazon’s aggressive expansion, unique market positioning and capability to disrupt new industries, in the meantime, helped its stock scale new highs despite lofty valuations. Amazon has outperformed the Internet - Commerce industry in the past year (+68.3% vs +48.5%).In fact, the company’s projected growth rate for the current year is 89.9%, while the broader industry is expected to gain only 11.6%. To top it, investors have seen two upward earnings estimate revisions, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the current-year time frame. And the consensus estimate for Amazon has trended upward over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $8.49/share to $8.64/share right now. If this wasn’t enough, the company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +12.08%. A solid Zacks Rank and positive ESP have resulted in an earnings beat 70% of the times over the past decade.

33,BRK.B,"As expected, the Fed kept the short-term interest rates steady at 1-1.25% in its two-day FOMC meeting concluded yesterday and laid out the timing of reverse quantitative easing (QE), starting next month.The central bank will start unwinding its $4.5-trillion balance sheet, which is mostly composed of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it acquired under a program known as QE till 2014 since recession. So long, it has reinvested the entire proceeds it got from bonds. Now, the Fed will use a cap system every month to execute its roll off plans and reinvest the rest.The central bank has set a roll off target of $10 billion ($6 billion in Treasuries and $4 billion in mortgage-backed securities) per month that will increase every quarter until it reaches $50 billion ($30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for mortgage-backed securities) a month. The process is likely to continue until the balance sheet reaches about $2-$2.5 trillion.The Fed also hinted at one more rate hike this year and expects three lift-offs in 2018. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, the odds for a rate hike by December increased substantially to 67% from 58% a day ago (read: Should You Buy Bank ETFs Ahead of the Fed Meeting?).The move gave a bit more hawkish-than-expected signal, pushing Treasury yields higher, and in turn benefiting the financial sector. The sector is a major beneficiary of a rising-interest-rates environment. This is because the steepening yield curve would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers.Further, the upside to the finance sector is confirmed by the Zacks Sector Rank in the top 50% with more than 70% of the industries placed in the top 38%. This suggests continued outperformance for the sector for the coming months.

34,BRK.B,"With Hurricane Harvey devastating large portions of Texas and tensions between the U.S. and North Korea heating up once again, it has already been a difficult week for many people across the country. Because of this, our latest edition of Wednesday Wisdom will focus on the words an investor known for his wisdom, patience, and level-headedness: Charlie Munger.While Munger is less outspoken than his longtime business partner Warren Buffett, his approach to value investing is just as important to remember. The vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) is well known for his ability to eliminate biases from his investing decisions, and what’s more, Munger has always been public about his belief in companies that are ethical.Like Buffett, Munger has emerged as one of the most successful value investors of all time. His first job was at a grocery store owned by Warren Buffett’s grandfather, but he quickly worked his way up through the business world and is now worth more than $1.5 billion.With a fortune like this, it’s obvious that Munger has figured something out, so this week’s Wednesday Wisdom will take a look at a few of his most iconic quotes to see if we can learn something useful about the practice of investing.We don’t talk about this often enough, but our individual personalities can be one of the biggest challenges to overcome in the investing world. While Munger has made the observation that people with high IQs are often too temperamental to be successful investors, he’s really speaking to a larger problem that can affect anyone. Regardless of your IQ, we are all susceptible to our personal biases, and we must always work to mitigate their influences over our portfolios.Patience, patience, patience. Unfortunately, investors frequently forget that, by definition, investing is a long-term activity. For most people, the goal of investing is to steadily accrue profits over time in order to provide a better future for themselves. That’s a task that requires patience. Sometimes even the strongest investing decisions take a long time to pay off.What Munger is getting at here is the old “KISS” adage: keep it simple, stupid. Here at Zacks, we also believe in a simple investing philosophy, and we’ve developed a proven system that places an emphasis on earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions to find the highest quality stocks.As our founder Len Zacks once infamously declared, “Earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices.” It’s that simple.Want more advice from the investing greats?

35,BRK.B,"e massive trail of destruction in Houston and Texas Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Harvey has left insurers feeling jittery in the fear of high claim costs. While its too early to estimate the loss incurred due to the calamity, one of JPMorgan analyst’s anticipates potential losses to range anywhere from $10-$20 billion.Harvey, which went from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane, is expected to be among the top 10 financially damaging catastrophes ever to strike the United States.Is There a Silver Lining to the Cloud?On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurer's underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. Notably, insurance industry is highly cyclical in nature, and is characterized by periods of soft and hard pricing phases.Major events like Harvey are required by the industry now to turn the pricing cycle. A benign cat loss environment in the recent years fattened the capital reserves of the insurers resulting in the loosening of underwriting standards as insurers equipped with huge cash did not mind undertaking risky businesses at low prices. This heightened competition and insurers were compelled to lower prices further to attract more business. Eventually, pricing woes crept up, as evident by the continued soft pricing in many insurance business lines.Though the industry suffered a cat loss of $21.6 billion in 2016, it was only a modest increase compared with the 10-year average of $19.1 billion.A recent report by Swiss Re states that global insured losses from disasters plunged to $23 billion in the first half of 2017 from $36 billion in the year-ago period.Lower levels of claims from natural catastrophes and other disasters suppressed demand for insurance against such events, consequently putting pressure on premiums.Further, a report from insurance broker Marsh stated that global insurance rates fell for the 17th consecutive quarter, with property insurance rates down 2.8%.In a recent fact release, the Information Insurance Institute stated that the private insurance industry will easily able to handle losses from Harvey As of Mar 31, 2017, the U.S. property/casualty industry has $709 billion of capital, a cushion that is more than adequate to deal with events like the one mentioned above.Nevertheless, the industry has outperformed the broader market in last two years, evident from a return of 32% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 24%. Insurance Stocks in FocusCompanies such as Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report), and Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report) have a significant presence in the region with market share of nearly 13%, 11% and 9%, respectively. Other companies with presence in Texas are MeLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report), Kemper Corp., Chubb Ltd. among others. However, these companies have considerably lower market share in the region.Shares of both Progressive and Berkshire Hathaway fell by 2.3%, while Allstate and Travellers declined 1.5% and 2.6%, respectively, on Aug 28, the first trading session after Harvey struck on the night of Aug 25.Nevertheless, some of the stocks gained the following trading day on the likelihood of benefiting from raised premiums due to the devastation caused by Harvey.ConclusionIt remains to be seen weather-related losses over the coming months can shrink the massive capital surplus and change the insurance pricing cycle of the industry.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

36,BRK.B,"Holding shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (BRK.B  -  Free Report) render dynamism to a shareholder’s portfolio. It gives a feel of investing in mutual funds apart from rewarding investors with higher returns at the same time. But above all, the company has Warren Buffett at its helm, creating tremendous value for shareholders over the last 51 years with his unique skills.Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate with more than 90 subsidiaries engaging in businesses ranging from ice-cream to insurance. Nonetheless, its property and casualty insurance business generates maximum return on equity. However, the company faces the risk of volatile underwriting results due to exposure to catastrophes. Nonetheless, its inorganic growth story remains impressive with addition of heavyweight names in its portfolio.The company’s stakes in Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) increases fourfold. It also raised its stakes in the four biggest U.S. airlines, plus acquired Precision Castparts and made an investment in The Kraft Heinz Co (KHC  -  Free Report), Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report), among others.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have gained 5.5% quarter to date, edging past the industry’s growth of 3.8%. It has also outpaced the S&P 500’s 0.74% gain.However, the stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Also, estimates witnessed downward revisions over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 moved south by 5.5% and for 2018, by 2.6%. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway failed to beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and the average surprise was a negative 6.91%. Also its VGM Score is D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all these three factors.Are There Stocks Worth Adding to Portfolio?Berkshire Hathaway, the name says it all. Yet there are other attractive stocks in the property & casualty insurance industry that may not be as big a name as Berkshire Hathaway but promise greater returns.With the Federal Reserve already hiking rates twice this year (intended for one more), the property and casualty insurers stand to benefit from the improving rate environment. This is because investment income a major component of an insurer’s top line.Improving economy indicating more disposable income and better consumer sentiment should support more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher.Though increasing catastrophes will induce volatility in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to counter the anticipated loss.Additionally, influx of capital, building of reserves and containment of underwriting expenses also pave the way for growth prospects.Choosing the StocksApart from Berkshire Hathaway, we have zeroed in on two other stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio. We refine our search using the VGM Score, price performance quarter to date, a favorable Zacks Rank, an attractive price-to-book (P/B) and northbound estimate revisions.  VGM Score of A or B coupled with Buy rated stocks are best bets.Illinois-based Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (AFH  -  Free Report) engages in underwriting commercial automobile insurance policies in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of B. The P/B ratio is 1.41. The company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 57.94%. Atlas Financial is witnessing upward estimate revisions — up 4.5% for 2017 and 2.6% for 2018, respectively, — over the last 60 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Shares of Atlas Financial have rallied 12.8% quarter to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s growth and Berkshire Hathaway’s gain.California-based First American Financial Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report) provides financial services. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. The P/B ratio is 1.67. The company delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 12.64%. First American Financial is witnessing upward estimate revisions — up 9.2% for 2017 and 6.4% for 2018, respectively, — over the last 60 days. Its expected long term earnings growth is pegged at 13%, better than the industry average of 10.4%.Shares of First American Financial have gained 8.3% quarter to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s growth and Berkshire Hathaway’s gain.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars. But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar. And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month. Learn the secret >>

37,BRK.B,"If you are an avid investor, you must also be a diehard fan of the Oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffet has consistently beaten the markets for decades by accumulating positions in some of the world’s sought-after companies. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time, while they also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Thus, let us focus on Buffet’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the first-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price. But before we do so, let us look at his top stock holdings from his darling sectors:Financials Scoops Up Top SpotBuffett has huge stakes in several financial stocks. He has, particularly, liked American Express since the 1960s. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) holds around 151.6 million shares of the credit card giant, valued at $15 billion. When it comes to banks, Berkshire has a sizeable position in Bank of America, which is nearly $20.4 billion. Buffett’s second-largest holding is America’s second most profitable bank, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Berkshire holds 452.8 million shares of Wells Fargo, which indicates that Buffett is quite optimistic about the current financial environment.A recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. But, this time around, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks).Consumer Goods Comes SecondBuffett has a sizeable position in consumer stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz. Coca-Cola is much trusted as Buffet has assured that he will never sell shares in the renowned beverage company. Berkshire held around 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, making it the company’s fourth-largest holding. Kraft Heinz is another consumer staples firm where Buffett and his company has 325.6 million shares, worth $25.3 billion.Consumer staples seems to be the safest option at a time when markets are plagued with widespread uncertainty. Trump talk of Syria bombing, unabated trade tensions, high profile departures in the Trump administration and midterm election year spell a rough phase for stocks. Staples, on the other hand, is generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the state of the larger market.Tech Takes Third SpotThe Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates, in the meantime, has already provided the much-needed windfall to computer and software makers. Any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%, per the latest tax law.The lowering of the tax rate will encourage big tech companies to bring back funds held overseas. This in turn will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and engage in M&A activities. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will make the most of the positive tax overhaul initiative by repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. It is also the most valuable holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.Industrials & Airlines in FocusBuffett has the fourth-largest stake in the Industrials sector. And why not? Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.But, Buffet has started to show keen interest in airlines which he earlier used to steer clear of. He believes that planes being more efficient and relationships between unions being better will certainly help airlines fly high. Buffett holds several airlines, but, Southwest Airlines is the most valuable.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Consider in Q1 EarningsAs mentioned above, American business magnate Warren Buffet’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. But, not all of his choices from the aforesaid sectors will report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings.We have, thus, figured out three of his top stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett particularly likes Moody’s as the company continues to post strong numbers, so there’s some real money-making potential there. The company, in the most recent quarter, declared an operating income of $462.8 million.The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on Apr 27. Moody's has an Earnings ESP of +0.85%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.9%, better than the industry’s estimated growth of 21.4%.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett favors Mastercard as an increasing number of customers are switching to cashless payments, as it is preferred by most businessmen.The company is likely to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on May 2. Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of +2.39%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 29.7%, well ahead of the industry’s projected growth of 15%.Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) is a payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities to electronic payments.Buffett likes Visa as the company has the same competitive advantages and business qualities that Mastercard possesses.Visa is expected to report earnings results for the March quarter on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.2%, above the industry’s projected growth of 15%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

38,BRK.B,"After a promising start to 2018, major stock indexes forfeited their yearly gains over the past few weeks amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war between the U.S. and China. Now, as investors look to rebound from what has been a tough stretch for many, it could prove prudent to dig deep into the tried-and-true strategies of Wall Street’s top figures.One of those top performers is, of course, the legendary Warren Buffett. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his decades of success, Buffett has amassed billions of dollars through a meticulous brand of value investing that touts patience and confidence. Simply put, Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) firm are icons of the investing world.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. This portfolio is tracked by a large swath of investors looking to mimic the success of Berkshire’s legendary CEO.But not even Berkshire Hathaway has made it through 2018’s early volatility unscathed, and with most of the public lacking the patience of Buffett, some followers of the portfolio might consider ditching some of its worst-performing stocks. Let’s take a closer look.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report)Commercial banking giant Wells Fargo has been marred by a fraudulent account scandal that tracked back to upper management, calling the company’s business practices into question and damaging its public reputation. More recently, interest rate uncertainty has caused headwinds for the finance sector. Shares of WFC have slipped more than 13% so this year, lagging the S&P 500’s nearly 2% drop.Buffett has been forced to publicly defend Wells Fargo at times, with the bank remaining one of Berkshire’s largest holdings. On top of that, Wells Fargo has underperformed from an earnings standpoint, missing consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter and inspiring a significant selloff.The company has an opportunity to turn things around with its new report on Friday. Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting that Wells Fargo will post earnings growth of 7%, but revenue is expected to be down year over year and could add more pressure to the situation.Still, earnings estimates have trended slightly higher throughout the quarter, indicating that the company’s fortunes could be improving. WFC is holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) heading into its report date. Meanwhile, shares are trading at just 10.9x forward 12-month earnings, which is a discount to the stock’s median Forward P/E of 12.5 displayed over the past year.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)Kraft Heinz remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, but the stock has underperformed amid a continued shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. The stock has tumbled more than 21% so far this year, and shares are hovering just above their 52-week low.These headwinds are putting pressure on Kraft’s earnings outlook. Within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed seven revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. Analysts now expect the company to post earnings growth of 8% on net sales growth of 1%.This negative estimate revision activity has earned KHC a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Still, the Zacks Rank is only designed to be a one- to three-month indicator, and Kraft’s dividend yield of 4.1% is likely to keep buy-and-hold investors on board.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)Southwest was one of Berkshire’s 10-largest holdings at the end of 2017, followed shortly by fellow airline company Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report). Unfortunately, industry-wide headwinds—including lower-than-expected demand for spring travel—have punished these stocks. Heading into the day, LUV was down more than 17% on a year-to-date basis.Management has a bearish view on unit revenues for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile to be flat, down from the previous forecast of growth between 1% and 2% from the prior-year quarter.This negative outlook has put a damper on analyst sentiment for Southwest. Over the past two months, LUV has witnessed six negative revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement among revising analysts. This negative revision activity has given the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more market analysis from this author?

39,BRK.B,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) shares gained more than 5% in intraday trading yesterday, recording its biggest one-day gain since April 2015, before closing at $13.44 for a 4.3% jump. This followed a dismal trading session on Monday when the shares plummeted to $12.86 — the lowest since July 2009.By and large, investors were accustomed to bearish reports on GE due to continuous lackluster performance in the recent quarters amid portfolio restructuring initiatives along with a top management overhaul.So what suddenly drove the positive share price movement?Speculations are rife that Warren Buffett, the famed investor and the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report), is likely to invest in GE, aiming to capitalize on the undervalued stocks. The rumors created an unlikely rally for GE shares as investors probably believed in Buffett’s wisdom and decided to join the bandwagon. Like Buffett, investors too expected to gain from a stock that seemed to have long-term potential despite losing more than half its market value last year.GE shares might have also benefited from an overall comeback in Wall Street sentiments as fears of an escalated trade war were allayed. The murky trade war resulting from tariffs and counter tariffs imposed by the United States and China could have overtly hurt exporting firms like GE. As the tensions gradually eased, the market rallied, benefiting stocks like GE, which recorded the biggest percentage gain among components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Despite the euphoria, shares of GE have underperformed the industry, with an average loss of 54.7% in a year compared with a decline of 14.2% for the latter. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery had earlier decided to focus on three core businesses: Aviation, Healthcare and Power. However, the company is now contemplating to spin-off its core operations to maximize shareholder returns after taking a hit of $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter from the legacy insurance business. This could result in further fluctuations in share price as the market awaits clarifications.Significant order backlog, high operating risks related to the Brexit referendum and foreign currency woes remain other headwinds. GE Power has been the biggest drag on margins due to lower demand of turbines. The company aims to improve its profitability by reducing overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. GE further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.GE has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Federal Signal beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 16.5%.Crane has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.4%. It has beaten earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

40,BRK.B,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) recently cleared the final regulatory red tape in its acquisition of Oncor, following the receipt of the Public Utility Commission of Texas’ (“PUCT”) approval for the deal. PUCT’s sanction is a significant milestone achieved by the company as it will facilitate the completion of the pending Energy Future Holdings Corp. (“EFH”) buyout, the parent company of Oncor.What’s the Deal?In August 2017, Sempra Energy announced that it is set to buy EFH and in turnTexas’ electrical grid giant Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor) as well.  Including Oncor’s debt, the enterprise value of Sempra's proposed offer for the Oncor buyout is $18.8 billion. Notably, the company aims at acquiring 80% ownership of Oncor. Per the terms, Sempra Energy will maintain the existing independence of Oncor's board of directors, on completion of the transaction.Impressively, per media sources, Sempra Energy practically snatched away Oncor from Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) that has been bidding for this regulated utility since July 2017.Synergies from the AcquisitionThe deal will add Texas’ largest electric transmission and distribution provider to Sempra Energy’s portfolio, thereby expanding its market in the state where it currently operates only 10 power plants. Apart from expanding the company’s regulated earnings base, this deal will boost Sempra Energy’s future growth in the Texas energy market and U.S. Gulf Coast region.Meanwhile, management at Sempra Energy believes this transaction will enhance the company’s business mix and provide increased and more geographically diversified utility earnings.Sempra Energy earlier announced that the buyout, expected to be over by the first half of 2018, will be accretive to its earnings, beginning in 2018. In line with this, during its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company declared that it expects the Oncor buyout to be accretive to its 2018 earnings by 20 cents per share.With Oncor’s plants providing electricity to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses in Texas, no doubt its acquisition will significantly enhance Sempra Energy’s customer base and thereby its profit level.We expect the company to duly complete the Oncor buyout within its expected time of first half of 2018, now that it has got through the last lap of regulatory approvals.Price PerformanceSempra Energy has outperformed the industry it belongs to, over a year. During this period, the company’s shares have rallied 1.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 0.6%. This might have been driven by the systematic investments that Sempra Energy makes in its infrastructure development projects.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are NewJersey Resources Corporation (NJR  -  Free Report) and Just Energy Group, Inc.

41,BRK.B,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Monday for the third consecutive trading day. The day’s gains helped markets recover from the correction which occurred earlier this month after key indexes reached their best levels ever on Jan 26. As of Feb 26, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down only 3.4%, 3.2% and 1.1%, respectively, from their January highs. The CBOE Volatility Index came at 15.97, its lowest settlement since Feb 2.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 1.6%, or 399.15 points, to close at 25,709.27. The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 2,779.60. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,421.46, gaining 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 4.2% to close at 15.80. A total of 6.3 billion shares were traded on Monday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.36 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.04-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.91-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Markets Rally for Third Straight Trading DayAll the key U.S. indexes rebounded and increased for the third consecutive trading day after entering correction territory earlier this month. The movement lacked specific catalysts, but some of the gains came after the Fed released its semi-annual monetary policy report on Friday ahead of the new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s first testimony on monetary policy in the Congress on Tuesday.In the monetary policy report the Fed sees the labor market is “little beyond full employment,” but wage gains will grow moderately. The report indicated that inflation will remain near or lower than Fed’s target rate of 2% this year. However, the semi-annual report did not throw any light on the number of rate hikes this year.Additionally, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Monday that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will “do a lot of rate hikes” provided the Committee has enough data to support such a move. Bullard’s cautious tone was mainly because he argued that the economy is still in a low-inflation, low-growth ""regime.""Meanwhile, the Dow registered an increase of around 400 points. For the S&P 500 index, nine out of 11 sectors increased during the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) jumped 1.6%, becoming the best performing sector among the S&P 500.

Consequently, CEO Warren Buffett announced a $29 billion benefit from recent U.S. tax restructuring. Buffett said that in case the company fails to get any market bargains it is expected to return the cash to its shareholders.Gains in Berkshire Hathaway had a positive impact on the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), which rose 1.5% becoming the second biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors.

42,BRK.B,"Californian utility provider Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) is set to buy Texas’ electrical grid giant Oncor Electric Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor). The move came after Sempra Energy confirmed to acquire Oncor’s parent company, Energy Future Holdings Corp., on Aug 21.Per media sources, by signing the deal, Sempra Energy practically snatched away Oncor from Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) that has been bidding for this regulated utility, since July.Details of the DealIncluding Oncor’s debt, the enterprise value of Sempra's proposed offer for Oncor is $18.8 billion. Excluding debt, Sempra Energy will pay cash worth $9.45 billion for ownership rights of Energy Future as well as Oncor.To fund the $9.45 billion cash, Sempra Energy plans to combine its own debt and equity, third-party equity, and $3 billion of expected investment-grade debt at the reorganized holding company. Sempra Energy expects its equity ownership after the transaction to be approximately 60% of the reorganized Energy Future company.The buyout, expected to be over by the first half of 2018, will be accretive to Sempra Energy's earnings beginning in 2018. However, the deal remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval from a handful of the U.S. regulatory authorities.Post the buyout, Sempra Energy will maintain the existing independence of Oncor's board of directors. On completion, the Oncor board will consist of 13 directors, including seven independent directors from Texas, two from existing equity holders and two from the new Sempra Energy-led holding company.Benefits of the BuyoutThe Oncor buyout will add Texas’ largest electric transmission and distribution provider to Sempra Energy’s portfolio, thereby expanding its market in the state where it currently operates only 10 power plants. Apart from expanding the company’s regulated earnings base, this deal will boost Sempra Energy’s future growth in the Texas energy market and U.S. Gulf Coast region.Although Energy Future has been suffering from bankruptcy issues since 2014,Oncor that earned $431 million of profit last year has always been considered a viable investment option. Notably, Oncor’s plants provides electricity to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses in Texas and with its acquisition Sempra Energy’s customer base is thus poised to grow.Moreover, per terms of the agreement, Sempra Energy will support Oncor's plan to invest $7.5 billion of capital over a five-year period to expand and reinforce its transmission and distribution network. This in turn will enhance the service territory of Oncor and in turn, Sempra Energy, thereby adding opportunity to earn more profit.Our Take on the AcquisitionIt is interesting to note that this is the fourth time that that an acquisition attempt has been made for Oncor. Last month, Berkshire Hathaway aimed to buy Oncor. In April, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) made an attempt to take over Oncor but failed to progress amid concerns from the Public Utility Commission of Texas. A buyout attempt last year backed by the Ray Hunt family of Dallas also faltered.However, this time, Elliott Management Corp. played a vital role in the finalization of the Oncor-takeover deal, with it being the largest creditor of bankrupt Energy Future Holdings. In fact, Elliott strongly opposed Berkshire Hathaway’s $18 billion offer, including debt, made in July, arguing it to be an undervalued one and not in creditors’ interest. On the contrary, the corporation backed Sempra’s bid for Oncor saying this time the proposal offers greater returns than offered by Berkshire.We believe the Oncor buyout to be a profitable strategic fit for Sempra Energy and will bolster the company's utility and energy infrastructure businesses, once integration is over post acquisition.Price PerformanceSempra Energy has outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the last one year. During this period, the company’s shares have rallied 9.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 8.4%. This might have been driven by the systematic investments that Sempra Energy makes in its infrastructure development projects.Zacks Rank & Key PickSempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Just Energy Group, Inc. (JE  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

44,BRK.B,"The second-quarter earnings season is at its high with 70% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, the performance of 350 index members (accounting for 79.3% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 11% on 5.9% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 74% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 16%, outperforming the top line.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 83.3% companies on the S&P 500 Index (accounting for 77.7% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.1% earnings growth on 4.8% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 80.0% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 66.3% for the top line is lower than the same of S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. A few insurers have incurred losses due to severe wind and hail catastrophe events, happened in during April-May in the U.S.    Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion, preserved on a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistent low rates. Annuity sales should have also gained from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably cut their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have also boosted more policy writings, driving the premiums higher to generate a lion’s share to an insurers’ top line. Besides, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably lifted the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been curbing the pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing this soft pricing.Let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 4.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) is a conglomerate providing insurance and reinsurance. Besides, it operates railroad systems, generates, transmits and distributes electricity, plus regulates natural gas distribution and storage facilities among others.  Last quarter, Berkshire missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.79%.

46,BRK.B,"Wednesday is officially here, and that means we could all use a little mid-week pick-me-up. So who do we turn to for some inspiration? As investors, that answer is almost always the wise and successful Warren Buffett, a man whose success on Wall Street is matched only by his positive outlook on life.Buffett—who, alongside Charlie Munger, has led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) for decades—is notorious for his investment philosophies and minimalist lifestyle. Indeed, the country’s second-richest man is also perhaps its most infamously frugal.Regardless of how he chooses to spend his mountains of cash, Buffett is looked up to in the business and financial world as a model for consistency and long-term success. And at 86 years of age, one can imagine that Buffett has plenty of lived experiences to share with the younger generations.In fact, Peter Kunhardt, the director of HBO’s Becoming Warren Buffett documentary, recently told CNBC that young people are “Warren’s favorite audience to talk with.”Becoming Warren Buffett is centered on Buffett holding a real, in-person chat in front of a class of high-school students. “He always said he'd like to be a teacher if he wasn't an investor,” Kunhardt added.But what exactly does Buffett say to young people when he gets the chance? Kunhardt said that he expected to hear specific business and money advice, but instead, Buffett delivered a rousing speech about how to be a good person.“His entire class, which lasted for a couple of hours, was about how to become a good, decent person, and how by becoming a good and decent person, you will become a successful person in business as well,” said Kunhardt.While it’s nice to hear these second-hand accounts, sometimes we actually want our advice directly from the horse’s mouth. Luckily, we get a chance to hear Buffett speak to a massive audience at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting.At this year’s event, Buffett and Munger spoke in front of the meeting’s nearly 40,000 attendees for hours. The longtime business partners entertained a plethora of questions, but according to CNBC, the pair had plenty of things to say to young people.Munger, the elder of the two, joked around a bit, saying “I’ve got some advice for the young: If you've got anything you really want to do, don't wait until you're 93.”Buffett offered some more serious advice about job searching and finding a satisfying career that you love.Sure, it’s probably pretty easy for the guy who is worth billions to recommend that young people find something that they love to do, but Buffett’s advice is an important reminder that the younger generation has plenty of time and freedom to discover what truly makes them happy.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

47,BRK.B,"(0:20) – New Rules for the S&P 500: Why is This Important?(1:45) - SNAP Gets Barred From the S&P 500(4:00) – Impact on Other Companies and IPOs(5:30) - Ulta Compared to Snapchat: Why Indexes Matter(7:20) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comAfter an IPO, one of the big steps for a company is its inclusion in major market indexes, such as the S&P 500. Getting added to a benchmark puts a company in focus, and it can have a decent impact on the actual stock too. That is because it basically results in forced buying of stocks, as funds tracking the indexes have no choice but to buy those that have been added, and remove those that have been ejected out of a benchmark.While you might think this is a small detail, more than three trillion dollars are in passive investments these days, and SPY alone has more than a quarter trillion dollars in assets. Add in the other two major ETFs tracking the S&P 500—VOO and IVV—and you are approaching half a trillion dollars that is directly based on this single benchmark, and that doesn’t even include mutual funds). With these kinds of numbers, you can see why this might be a big deal to a company, and why it can definitely help to reduce supply of a given stock (and thus have a positive impact on the price).But getting into indexes is by no means a guarantee, as many index providers have criteria for including firms into their benchmarks. This can include trading levels, size, location of headquarters, and now, can include share class structure too.This Week’s Podcast TopicIn today’s podcast, we take a closer look at this issue of multiple share classes and how some companies in particular might be impacted by the rules. Snapchat’s parent Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) is especially in focus due to these rules, as the company’s multiple share classes—and issuance of non-voting shares to the public—is preventing the company from ascending to the S&P 500, among other benchmarks.Thus, SNAP will not see the benefit from the forced index buying that many of its peers do. This is actually a huge deal, at least if we look to similarly-sized companies as a guide.Ulta SNAP is relatively comparable to Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), at least in terms of market cap. Plus, both are often considered growth stocks, so it is a decent enough proxy.For ULTA, the company makes up roughly seven basis points of the fund. That doesn’t sound like a lot—and it certainly isn’t compared to the blue chip giants out there—you have to remember how much money is in SPY and similar funds. Since there is such an enormous pool of money, SPY ends up owning about one percent of all the ULTA shares (according to Morningstar).But that is just SPY, there are plenty of other funds out there and the top 20 holding funds (according to Morningstar) account for more than a quarter of all the Ulta shares! Obviously, this is a huge percentage, but it doesn’t even scratch the surface of the fund and index impact on the company.And while SNAP won’t miss out on everything, it does seem doomed to miss out on many of the major indexes from not just S&P, but FTSE Russell as well. This is definitely something for investors to consider, and it could have repercussions for others in the market too.   Other FactorsInvestors should note that some of the more famous multi-share class companies, such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), will not be impacted by these new rules, as they will be grandfathered in. However, new companies like Snap or the three share class Blue Apron could be in trouble.Make sure to listen to today’s podcast for more information about this issue, and why it could have ramifications for plenty of tech companies and IPOs down the line too. Many aren’t going to want to miss out on this gigantic pool of money, and it may force some positive changes as a result.Bottom LineBut what do you think about SNAP and the indexes?

48,BRK.B,"Big moves from giants such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) helped lift the market and boost investor confidence on Monday.But despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding nearly 400 points and the S&P 500 climbing over 1.18%, investors shouldn’t assume that the recent extended sell-off is completely over. This means investors should remain aware of the most recent analyst sentiment, and as always, focus on stocks that are likely to top earnings estimates.Finding stocks that beat analysts’ expectations is a great and proven way to beat the market. With that in mind, one way for investors to try to make solid returns—especially during somewhat volatile times—is to pick stocks expected to beat earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.With all of this said, we are giving our readers a free look at five strong stocks in order to help them identify a handful of companies that seem ready to top earnings estimates this week.1.      Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR  -  Free Report)This Texas-based supplier of building products and prefabricated components for residential construction is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports a “B” for Value in our Style Scores system. Builders FirstSource’s fourth-quarter sales are projected to jump nearly 10%, while its earnings are expected to climb by 6.25%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.On top of that, BLDR’s Earnings ESP of 10.15% signals that earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of the firm’s Q4 results. Builders FirstSource is set to report its fourth-quarter and full fiscal year earnings on Wednesday, Feb. 28, after the closing bell.2.      TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report)This off-price retail power, which owns TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks a “B” grade for Value. Our current estimates are calling for TJX’s Q4 sales to climb over 14% to hit $10.82 billion. The retailer’s earnings are expected to come in at $1.28 per share, which would mark a nearly 24% year-over-year jump.TJX also has an Earnings ESP of 0.51%, signaling that analyst sentiment about the retailer has improved recently. Investors should also note that TJX has met or topped earnings estimates in 14-straight quarters. The retaileris set to report its Q4 and fiscal full-year earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday, February 28.3.       Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report)The parent company of Monster Energy and other beverages is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and earns a “B” grade for Growth. Monster is expected to see its sales pop by 11.64% while its earnings are projected to expand by 5.71%.Monster currentlyhas an Earnings ESP of 3.40%. Investors might be happy to note that the beverage giant topped earnings estimates by nearly 17% in the fourth quarter of 2016. MNST is set to report its Q4 and fiscal full-year earnings after market close on Wednesday, Feb. 28.4.       Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report)Best Buy is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports “A” grades for both Value and Growth, as well as a “B” for Momentum. Before last quarter, this retail electronics power had topped or beat earnings estimates for nearly five years in a row, with massive beats in the first and second quarters of 2017.Best Buy is expected to see its Q4 earning reach $2.03 per share, which would mark a 4.10% jump from the year-ago period. BBY also currently sports an Earnings ESP of 4.59%. Best Buy is expected to report its Q4 results before the opening bell Thursday, March 1.5.       Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report)This sports apparel and footwear retailer is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts an overall “A” VGM score. Last quarter, Foot Locker topped our consensus earnings estimate figure by 8.75%.

49,BRK.B,"Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) surged nearly 2% to inch closer to their all-time high on Monday following an array of news regarding the iPhone giant, including a significant iCloud announcement and further investment from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report).iCloud UpdateApple’s iCloud service has become widely popular with customers, especially on iPhone and iPad devices. The company’s storage service allows Apple users to store a massive amount of data—often photos and videos—in the cloud to prevent their devices from filling up.The platform is widely used, but some investors might not know that the company uses other cloud computing technology to house Apple user data. Apple noted in a recent iOS Security update that it now uses Alphabet (GOOGL) cloud services.“The keys and the file’s metadata are stored by Apple in the user’s iCloud account,” Apple noted in the report. “The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as S3 and Google Cloud Platform.”Media outlets had previously reported—as early as 2016—that Apple uses Google’s cloud services for iCloud storage, but Apple did not confirm this until recently.Apple has worked heavily with Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure cloud services, as well as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS, in the past. Microsoft was notably left out of the language in the most recent report, while Amazon’s S3 cloud-based data storage service is still mentioned.China According to a new Reuters report, Apple will begin to store its iCloud data for Chinese customers in China. Until now, the company stored its Chinese data in the U.S. This move has raised some security concerns, as many experts worry that the Chinese government will be able to access user data too easily.A new set of Chinese laws require cloud services offered to Chinese citizens be operated by Chinese companies, with the data stored in China.The Chinese government previously had to go through the U.S. legal system in order to obtain any information it might want. Now it will not. “While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful,” Apple said in a statement.Apple users outside of China won’t have their iCould storage changed in any way.Warren BuffettWarren Buffett seems more bullish on Apple than ever before. The Oracle of Omaha noted in a recent interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that his company has purchased more Apple stock than anything else over the last year.Buffett placed much of his faith in Apple on the company’s ability to keep customers.""Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,"" Buffett told CNBC. ""I see how strong that ecosystem is, to an extraordinary degree. … You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using. [IPhone] is a very sticky product.""Berkshire Hathaway’s other large positions include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and other industry powers.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

50,BRK.B,"Pre-market futures are up again ahead of the first trading day for the new week. We saw European market indexes rise and Asian markets perform even better — +1.2% on both the Shanghai and Nikkei. This follows a robust Friday in domestic indexes, particularly the 349-point gain (1.4%) in the Dow.Warren Buffett maintained his formidable relevance this morning, appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box with host Becky Quick following his 53rd yearly letter to shareholders released this weekend. The Oracle of Omaha spoke about his firm, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), gaining $100 billion gain in unrealized equities, translating to massive reduced liabilities. Boiling this down, Buffett announced a $29 billion benefit from recent U.S. tax restructuring.Buffett will also be stepping down from the board of Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), which initially pressurized shares before the rising tide of market futures lifting this boat as well. The 87-year-old with a net worth of $87 billion also spoke about his planned healthcare services platform, combining efforts of Berkshire with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), while citing the healthcare industry in the U.S. is a “major economic problem.”Specifically, Buffett cited the choice of the right CEO is crucial for this venture, with the goal being to improve healthcare for everyone. It looks to be a potentially huge enterprise without its main goal being to cut costs and turn a profit.Q4 earnings season begins to unwind — save for the retailers, whose fiscal calendar is a month behind to collect complete holiday shopping data — but prior to today’s open, we saw a top- and bottom-line miss for Dean Foods (DF  -  Free Report). The dairy giant posted 25 cents per share, missing by a penny and -34% year over year, on $1.94 billion in sales which fell short of the $1.95 billion expected. Guidance for full-year 2018 is in a range of 55-80 cents per share; the Zacks consensus was 86 cents. For more on DF’s earnings, click here.

53,BRK.B,"The Fed minutes released yesterday signaled a hawkish stance and raised the chances of a faster-than-expected rates hike. This is because Fed officials are now more confident about economic growth and the need to keep raising rates as inflation picks up.They now see a much stronger economy than at the end of 2017, thanks to tax cuts, increased consumer spending, rising consumer confidence, 17-year low unemployment, pick up in average hourly earnings and better-than-expected January inflation numbers (read: 5 ETF Ways to Trade Surging Inflation).The minutes point to “further gradual increases” in short-term interest rate. Many market participants believe that the addition of the word “further” opens the door to four hikes. According to data compiled by CME Group, there is 30% probability that the Fed will raise rates four times this year, compared with about 20% a month ago.In particular, the combination of tax cuts and spending increases would result in higher inflation, compelling Fed to tighten its policy aggressively. Notably, the first rate hike for this year is expected to come as soon as next month.The hawkish signals pushed Treasury yields higher, and are expected to benefit the financial sector. The sector is a major beneficiary of a rising interest rate environment. This is because the steepening yield curve bolsters profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers (read: 7 Ways to Play Rising Yields With Inverse Treasury ETFs).Given this, we have highlighted three ETFs and stocks that are expected to see smooth trading this year and lead the market higher.Top ETFsWhile there are a number of ETFs in this corner of the market, we have highlighted those that have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This is by far the most popular financial ETF in the space with AUM of $33.1 billion and average daily volume of nearly 59 million shares. The fund follows the Financial Select Sector Index, holding 67 stocks in its basket with double-digit allocation to the top two firms, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report). In terms of industrial exposure, banks take the top spot at 45.5% while capital markets, insurance and diversified financial services make up for a double-digit exposure each. The fund charges 13 bps in annual fees and is up 3.6% in the year-to-date time frame (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report)This fund manages nearly $8 billion in asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 408 stocks by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Financials 25/50 Index. It is pretty well spread with each holding no more than 9.4% of the assets. Banks account for nearly half of the portfolio, followed by insurance (19%) and financial services (11%). The product sees solid volume of 666,000 shares and charges 10 bps in annual fees. It has gained 3.4% since the start of the year.iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to U.S. investment banks, discount brokerages, and stock exchange firms by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Investment Services Index. The product holds 27 securities with the largest allocation going to top five firms that collectively account for 44.4% of the portfolio. It has accumulated $224.1 million in AUM and trades in moderate volume of nearly 41,000 shares a day. The product charges 44 bps in fees per year from investors and has gained 4.6% in the year-to-date timeframe.Top StocksWe have chosen three stocks using the Zacks Stock Screener that fit our criteria of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and VGM Score of A or B.Moelis & Company (MC  -  Free Report) It is a global independent investment bank providing strategic and financial advisory services in the United States and internationally.

54,BRK.B,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, after the market closes. The company’s poor earnings history shows that its bottom line missed estimates in the first three quarters of 2017.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This Quarter    Earnings at Berkshire Hathaway have possibly been aided by an improved performance across all segments. However, soft underwriting results at Insurance Operations segment due to cat loss are anticipated to have weighed on the company’s bottom-line improvement. In fact the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.77, reflecting a noticeable slip of 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Nonetheless, a compelling array of products is expected to have driven higher revenues at Insurance Operations.Results at Railroad, Utilities and Energy segments are projected to have benefited from higher contribution from both BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.Also, strategic acquisitions and investments are likely to have favored the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Berkshire Hathaway is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Berkshire Hathaway has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.77. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Berkshire Hathaway carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates in the next releases are as follows:Bank of Montreal (BMO  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 27 with an Earnings ESP of +0.60% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is set to release third-quarter earnings on Feb 22.Eaton Vance Corporation (EV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.41%. This Zacks #2 Ranked player is set to announce third-quarter earnings on Feb 27.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

55,BRK.B,"Following investing strategies of billionaire investor Warren Buffett is everyone’s dream. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) has added more than 100% over the last five years (as of February 15, 2018), way better than the 73% gain of the broader market ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) during the same time frame.The winning trend of Berkshire Hathaway is continuing as the entity tacked on about 12% in the last three months compared with 5.6% offered by the key U.S. equity gauge S&P 500 index-based ETF.Notably, Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing disclosing the fourth-quarter stock holdings has shown some major changes. Below we highlight those alterations in portfolios, so that retail investors can bank on some winning ETF and stock investment strategies.Take a Bite of Apple  Buffett is outright bullish on Apple. This is evident from his raising of stake in Apple by 23.3% to 165.3 million shares. Last year, Buffett indicated that consumers ‘want the product’ (or Apple products) despite its price. The in-fashion stock gained more than 9% in the last five days (as of Feb 15, 2018), mostly reflecting Berkshire Hathaway’s interests. Apple’s five-day gains of 6.3% came in comparison of 3.5% increase in SPY (as of Feb 16, 2018).Apple has a Value Score of B. Investors interested in following Buffett and being part of Apple’s growth story, can play ETFs like iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report), Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT  -  Free Report) (read: Can Tech ETFs Regain Investors' Love After Selloff Snub?).Rush Out of IBMBerkshire scrapped about 94.5% of its IBM holdings, leaving only 2.05 million shares. In his latest move, Buffett cut IBM holdings by about 32%. Per an article published on CNBC, Buffett last year said ""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too.""So, investors following Buffett may opt to stay away from the likes of First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV  -  Free Report) as the fund has about 8% weight in IBM. But the fund has other strong candidates like Apple (read: ETFs to Buy as Cisco Returns to Revenue Growth in 2 Years).Treat Teva Nicely Berkshire surprised many investors by disclosing its stake in drug-maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) during the fourth quarter. Teva has about 15.7% weight in iShares MSCI Israel ETF (EIS  -  Free Report), around 5% weight in VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (PPH  -  Free Report) and 5.4% in VanEck Vectors Generic Drugs ETF (GNRX  -  Free Report).Bet Big on Bank of New York Mellon Berkshire upped its stake in Bank of New York Mellon (BK) by about 20% during the fourth quarter. The stock has about 4.6% exposure in Davis Select Financial ETF DFNL.Get Rid of General Mortars Berkshire offloaded 10 million shares of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), which lowered its holdings by 16%. Funds like First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF FTXR and First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) have around 7% focus in General Motors.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

57,BRK.B,"Benchmarks ended in positive territory on for the fifth straight trading day on Thursday, with both the Dow and S&P 500 posting their best such feat since December 2011. Both the two indexes are now up over 4% for the year and are on the way to post their biggest weekly increases since November 2016. Additionally, the Nasdaq has increased more than 5% for the year.

On Nasdaq, a 2.25-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Markets Recover for Fifth Straight DayAll the key U.S. indexes rebounded and increased for the fifth consecutive trading day after entering correction territory last week. Although, the movement lacked specific catalysts, part of the day’s gains were fueled by strong earnings and a resilient U.S. economy. For the S&P 500, 10 of the 11 key sectors increased on Thursday, with utilities and technology stocks leading the way.On the earnings front, shares of Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) advanced 4.7% after reporting fiscal second quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, the company’s top line registered its first year-over-year rise in around two years.  (Read More)Additionally, Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares surged 3.4% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) increased its stake in Apple by more than 23% during the fourth quarter.

Although, initial claims increased, it still remains below the level of 300,000, implying a tighter labor market.Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.4% last month, after remaining unchanged in December. PPI registered year-over-year increase of 2.7% in January. Also, core-PPI increased 0.4% in January, better than December’s rise of 0.2%.

58,BRK.B,"No one person’s commentary about the stock market commands quite as much attention as that of Warren Buffett. Of course, the “Oracle of Omaha” has certainly earned that level of respect, amassing billions of dollars over decades of meticulous investing. But this also means that when Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) reports its latest holdings, investors often move quickly to copy its recent moves.Berkshire filed its 13F for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, providing the would-be Buffetts of the world with an update on the conglomerate’s latest adjustments and giving Wall Street the closest thing to a look inside the mind of the billionaire investor that it could possibly have.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. Some of the company’s larger stakes include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of American (BAC  -  Free Report), and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).During the fourth quarter, the portfolio’s value increased about 8%, reaching a whopping $191 billion on the back of one major new addition and several position increases. Should you be following in Buffett’s footsteps by buying the same stocks? Let’s take a closer look.Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by about 23% during the quarter. The technology behemoth is now the portfolio’s largest holding at 14.63% of its total value. Berkshire first purchased AAPL in Jan. 2016, and when asked to explain the move at the time, Buffet responded by simply saying, “Because I liked it.”Apple is currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has been hammered by the recent market sell-off, which occurred just days after the company reported disappointing iPhone sales during the holiday quarter. Nevertheless, the stock is sporting a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and the fact that it presents such a rare value opportunity in the tech sector probably explains Buffett’s position.Shares of Apple are trading at just 15x forward earnings, coming in slightly below the market-wide average. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of 1.26, so investors are getting a decent price for its growth aspirations as well. Apple’s P/S of 3.55 is a bit stretched, but the company remains a cash cow and is generating more than $11.30 in cash per share right now, significantly outpacing its industry peers.Apple remains a strong buy-and-hold option for investors focusing on financial security and value. The firm’s dominant grip on the consumer tech industry might be slipping a bit, but Apple should remain a titan for years to come.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report)Buffett and Berkshire took the bulk of their position in BNY Mellon during the second quarter of 2012. Since then, the size of the holding has fluctuated a bit, including several small decreases in 2015 and two 50% increases in 2017. The conglomerate also upped its stake in BK by about 20% during the fourth quarter, buying a number of shares between $51 and $55.BNY Mellon has performed basically in line with the market over the past year, moving a respectable 18% higher over that time. The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has an overall VGM grade of “D.”Investors should not expect explosive earnings growth or consistent market-beating returns from BNY Mellon. But the stock is probably a decent option for investors looking to diversify their financial holdings with a sound asset servicing company.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA  -  Free Report)Berkshire surprised many investors with the revelation that it had taken a new stake in this struggling drugmaker during the fourth quarter. Its position is relatively small and accounts for just 0.9% of the portfolio’s value, but it led many on Wall Street to question whether Buffett could see something in the stock that others were missing.The generic drug giant has faced significant headwinds lately, due in large part to lower U.S. generic drug prices and increased competition—causing management to take out massive loans to protect from its shrinking profit margins.Berkshire could be well positioned to benefit from the company’s planned turnaround, but investors should note that Teva is currently holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nevertheless, the Zacks Rank is only a one-to-three month indicator, and we know that Buffett likes to buy and hold his stocks well beyond that. Teva might be risky right now, but if the company can solve its debt crisis, it could bounce back over the next few years.Want more analysis from this author?

59,BRK.B,"Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) gained more than 2% in early morning trading Thursday after news emerged Wednesday that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) upped its stake in the technology behemoth during the fourth quarter.According to Berkshire’s latest quarterly filing, the conglomerate increased its holdings of Apple by 23.3% over the course of the quarter. Buffett and Berkshire first took a stake in the iPhone maker in 2016 and have slowly added to it since then.Apple shares were down about 1% on the year before Berkshire’s disclosure. The stock was dragged down in the recent market sell-off, which occurred just a few days after the company reported disappointing iPhone sales numbers (also read: Apple's First-Quarter iPhone Sales Drop 1%, Miss Estimates).But Apple also presents a rare value opportunity in today’s tech sector, and as far as value investors go, perhaps none have been more successful than Warren Buffett. The “Oracle of Omaha” has made his fortunes through long-term value investing and possesses a track record that speaks for itself.Interestingly enough, however, Buffett may not have been the driving force behind Berkshire’s initial investment in Apple. The billionaire has never identified one specific person as being responsible for the stake, but the idea is generally credited to Berkshire’s investment deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Speaking to CNBC last summer, Buffett said that he has “never sold a share” of Apple since first purchasing the stock. When asked at the time of the initial investment to explain why the choice was made, Buffett responded simply with, “Because I liked it.”Want more analysis from this author?

60,BRK.B,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) gained more than 10% in early morning trading Thursday after news emerged Wednesday that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) took a massive stake in the struggling drugmaker during the fourth quarter.Berkshire disclosed the holding—worth about $358 million—in the famous conglomerate’s latest quarterly filing. Shares of Teva were down nearly 50% over the past year before Buffett’s firm announced its stake.The purchase indicates that Teva’s recent slump has dragged the stock into the value territory that Buffett typically targets. The generic drug giant has faced significant headwinds lately, but Berkshire could be well positioned to benefit from the company’s planned turnaround.Nevertheless, a quick glance at Teva’s current fundamental situation suggests that this turnaround may be easier said than done. The firm’s core business has been hammered by a lower U.S. generic drug prices and increased competition—causing management to take out massive loans to protect from its shrinking profit margins.After losing half of its value in 2016, Teva initiated a strategic shift meant to address its new debt issues and identify its strongest businesses. Reports from last summer indicated that the company was looking to ramp up asset sales, putting several of its global brands—including its respiratory treatment assets and the Iceland-based drugmaker Medis—on the chopping block.But Teva’s commitment to solving its looming debt crisis was not enough for investors in 2017, and the stock shed another 50% over the course of a difficult year.“We believe that Teva’s disappointing generic business performance will take more time to improve given a combination of the generic industry’s intensifying secular challenges and Teva’s own difficulty in executing on its pipeline,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger in August.Teva is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But the stock does hold an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and these attractive valuation metrics likely inspired Buffett and Berkshire to make a play on the stock.Want more analysis from this author?

61,BRK.B,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) stock surged over 2.60% on Wednesday, despite reports that Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a critical letter to CEO Tim Sloan, questioning the embattled banking giant’s recent customer refund initiatives.Sen. Warren called out Sloan and Wells Fargo just days after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s latest wave of consumer refunds were marred by missteps. An array of mistakes—large and small—were reportedly made during the company’s effort to repay customers hurt by improper fees on car loans and home mortgages.Wells Fargo admitted last August that the company charged nearly 600,000 customers for auto insurance they didn't need and improperly charged 110,000 customers fees related to their mortgage rates. This comes on top of Wells Fargo’s massive fake account scandal that forced the bank’s previous CEO to step down in the fall of 2016.In her Feb. 13 letter, Sen. Warren posed nearly a dozen questions and accused Wells Fargo’s current CEO of breaking his promise to customers. However, the bank also received some praise from one of its biggest investors in the wake of Sen. Warren’s letter.Berkshire Backing Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A - (BRK.B  -  Free Report) vice chairman, Charlie Munger, supported Wells Fargo on Wednesday while he spoke at the Daily Journal Corporation’s  annual meeting in Los Angeles.“Of course, Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction,” Munger said at the meeting. “Of course, they were too slow in reacting to the bad news when it came. Everyone makes those mistakes, but we make fewer than others.”Munger went on to say that it’s “time for the regulators to let up on Wells Fargo” and that long-term the bank and its customers will likely be better off. It seems clear that the Berkshire executive thinks punishments levied against the company have been more than fair.Wells Fargo fired more than 5,000 employees in relation to its initial fraudulent account scandal and was also fined $185 million. More recently, in one of her final acts as head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen and regulators notified Wells Fargo that is could not grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in total assets it ended 2017 with ""until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.""As one of Warren Buffett’s right-hand men, what Munger says can carry significant weight. But it is unclear if federal regulators will care about what he has to say, as Wells Fargo was Berkshire’s top holding as of its most recent SEC filing. Berkshire owns roughly $27.5 billion worth of Wells Fargo shares.Wells Fargo, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has seen its stock price surge over the fast few days, even before today’s climb.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

62,BRK.B,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) seeks to raise about $10 billion from various sovereign-wealth funds, pensions and other big investors, as part of a new business strategy that involves buying and holding stakes in companies. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The move is similar to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s (BRK.B  -  Free Report) investment strategy. However, unlike Warren Buffett, who started buying whole companies, this new fund will target on taking only minority stakes in companies and then hold them for a long period of time.According to people familiar with the matter, this new investment vehicle is being called BlackRock’s “Long-Term Private Capital.""Notably, the investments made from this fund will be chaired by Mark Wiseman, whom the company had hired from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2016, to run its global active equity business. Also, management of the daily activities will be done by André Bourbonnais, the former chief executive officer of Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, according to the people familiar with the matter.The new venture may position BlackRock to compete with various Wall Street private equity giants like Carlyle Group LP, Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report) and its former holding company, The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report).Being one of the largest asset managers, with assets under management of almost $6.3 trillion as of Dec 31, 2017, BlackRock already manages various publicly offered mutual funds and other exchange-traded funds for its investors. However, till now, it did not have a separate fund of its own that would be used to buy stakes in other companies.Moreover, BlackRock seems well positioned for growth in the future, given its strong global presence, broad product diversification, solid revenue mix and efforts to strengthen the iShares and ETF operations.Shares of the company have gained 35% in 2017, outperforming the 31.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

63,BRK.B,"The Dow experienced a mixed week, losing momentum over the first few days before rebounding over the next two. Bond yields spiked following improved inflation and rate hike prospects leading investors to switch from equities to bonds. Such expectations were heightened after the Fed indicated that a rate hike in March was more or less certain. Financial blue-chips gained as a result, which, along with bullish earnings numbers helped the index gain over the latter half of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.8% last Friday following better-than-expected earnings from Intel Corporation INTC. Additionally, the Dow posted a rise of more than 220 points. Meanwhile, U.S. GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, following gains of more than 3% in the two previous quarters.This marks the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009. Additionally, during the week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments.The index gained 2.2% over last week. Benchmarks registered their fourth straight weekly increase after the Senate gave its consent to pass a Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, encouraging earnings results by The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) boosted markets.The Dow This WeekThe index decreased 0.7% on Monday, suffering its biggest one-day drop on Monday since Sep 5, 2017. These losses came following a shift in investment from equities to bonds after Treasury yields reached their best level since April 2014.Expectations of an increase in growth and inflation boosted yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, following which sectors like real estate and utilities that are considered as alternatives to bonds declined. Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) fell 2.1% on news that the tech behemoth has decided to halve its production target for the iPhone X in the first three months of the year.The index lost 1.4% on Tuesday following slump in both healthcare and energy stocks. Blue-chips like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) announced that they will together form a healthcare company in order to cut related costs for their U.S. employees.This announcement weighed on the healthcare sector. Oil prices fell on Tuesday after U.S. shale production came in at 9,878,000 barrels per day, its highest level since Jan 7, 1983, per the EIA. Separately, higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.The index increased 0.3% on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat expectations, which in turn boosted key indexes.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25-1.5% range. Markets lost some of their gains after the Fed stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates.The index gained 0.1% on Thursday even as investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014. However, rising rate hike prospects helped financial blue-chips The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan to gain 1.7% and 1%, respectively, which in turn boosted the Dow.Components Moving the Index Boeing reported adjusted earnings of $4.80 per share in fourth-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.91 by 64.9%. The bottom line reflected an improvement of 94% from $2.47 in the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by record deliveries, strong performance as well as favorable tax reform of $1.74 per share.The company's fourth-quarter revenues amounted to $25.37 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.83 billion by 2.2%. The top line also improved 9% year over year.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Boeing’s adjusted or core earnings per share expectation for 2018 are in the range of $13.80-$14.00.

These losses were caused by a surge in bond yields, a phenomenon which is likely to bother investors in the days ahead as well. However, with the Fed delineating its plans fairly clearly, markets are likely to price in a March rate hike in the near term. Given such a backdrop along with bullish earnings and a strong economy, markets are likely to notch up fresh milestones in the days ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

64,BRK.B,"Benchmarks finished in negative territory on Tuesday following slump in both healthcare and energy stocks. Blue-chips like Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan announced that they will together form a healthcare company in order to cut related costs for their U.S. employees, which in turn weighed on the healthcare sector.Additionally, recent increase in U.S. shale production led energy stocks downward. Moreover, rising bond yields had a broad-based negative impact on all the three key indexes.

65,BRK.B,"The market rally is heating up this year with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indices breaching new milestones. After hitting 2,700 on the second trading session of the New Year, the S&P 500 closed above 2,800 for the first time while the Dow Jones closed above 26,000, easily setting the record for the fastest 1,000-point rise in its history, after topping 25,000 on Jan 4.The euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation is fueling the rally. This is because a massive $1.5-trillion tax cut will likely create an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings and save companies billions of dollars, leading to increased dividend and buyback activities and paving the way for increased mergers and acquisitions (read: 7 Biggest ETF Stories of 2017 to Continue in 2018).A bizarre jump in oil price, weak dollar, improving global growth and rounds of upbeat economic data -- especially in the areas of manufacturing, construction spending and retail -- are adding to the strength.  Further, the Q4 reporting cycle is off to a strong start, with earnings of 36 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 11.8% from the same period last year on 7.7% higher revenues, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.

66,BRK.B,"The euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation is pushing Wall Street to new heights this year. After hitting 2,700 on the second trading session of the New Year, the S&P 500 breached another milestone of 2,800, for the first time.Moreover, the Dow Jones also crossed the 26,000 mark, easily setting the record for the fastest 1,000-point rise in its history after topping 25,000 on Jan 4 (read: Top & Flop ETFs of the New Year).Buoyancy FlowingThe massive $1.5-trillion tax cuts will create an economic surge both domestic and international, boosting job growth and earnings of corporates. Additionally, jump in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat economic data added to the strength. Manufacturing activity, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management, climbed to the second-highest reading in six years while construction spending hit record highs in November with broad-based gains in both private and public outlays. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, capping the strongest year of sales growth since 2014.The market is anticipating that companies will come up with big gains in earnings and increased estimates for this year driven by tax cut savings. The Q4 earnings season is off to a strong start, with earnings of 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 13.6% from the same period last year on 9.1% higher revenues, with 73.1% beating EPS estimates and 80.8% beating revenue estimates. Overall, total earnings and revenues are projected to grow 9.2% and 7%, respectively (read: 4 ETFs & Stocks from Favorite Sectors for Q4 Earnings).However, the rally fizzled out later in yesterday’s trading session on concerns over the possible government shutdown. This represents the second drop so far this year. Congress needs to pass a spending bill by the end of Jan 19 to avoid a government shutdown. This pullback could be just a pause in the rally as traders took the chance to book some profits after a record run.Given the bullish fundamentals, the dips might charge up investors to snap up stocks and ETFs on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

67,BRK.B,"The ETF industry has seen explosive growth in terms of both AUM and launches thanks to unique strategies, novel concepts, transparency, diversification benefits, enhanced tax competence, less turnover and low cost (read: Why ETFs Are Thriving in 2017).In particular, investors seek to trade in ETFs that can easily be purchased and sold on the market, suggesting that the ETF should have enough liquidity. Volume, or the number of shares traded in a particular period, is definitely the most important consideration for determining the liquidity of a particular fund. A higher number of shares provides easy access to move in and out of the product, keeping the bid/ask spreads tight.Further, greater volume ensures easy creation and redemption of shares in the fund basket, which is a regular and vital mechanism in the ETF. This is especially true as authorized participants (AP) have the ability to create new baskets of ETF shares for underlying securities or redeem them when required. This phenomenon allows ETFs to trade in line with their net asset value (NAV) (see: all the Category ETFs here).Nevertheless, assessing just the number of shares is not a profitable task, as a higher number of cheaper funds can be bought for a given amount of money, leading to increased volumes. As a result, honing in on dollar volume ETFs will reveal the true picture of liquidity. Dollar volume measures the number of shares traded multiplied by share price.That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher dollar volume this year and are thus the top 10 volume leaders of 2017 as per xtf.com.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 well-diversified stocks in its basket with each holding less than 4% of the assets.Zacks ETF Rank: #3 (Hold)Aggregate YTD Volume: $4,327.2 billionAUM: $277.3 billionExpense Ratio: 0.09%Top Sector: Information Technology (24%)YTD Returns: 21.8%PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report)This product provides exposure to the 106 largest domestic and international companies, excluding financial stocks, by tracking the Nasdaq-100 Index.

68,BRK.B,"Warren Buffett’s impeccable knack for investment has enabled him to beat markets most of the time since 1964, when he took over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, (BRK.B  -  Free Report). This makes Buffett the unrivaled investment guru, widely followed by equity investors across the world.His investment acumen is evident from the way Berkshire Hathaway has grown into a conglomerate, piece by piece, over the years as a result of numerous small and big acquisitions. Now, Berkshire Hathaway houses more than 90 subsidiaries, selling everything from ice-cream to insurance under one roof.Buffett manages a huge portfolio of equities, cherry picked by himself and invested in float primarily generated from Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance business. Buffett eyes bargain stocks and mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment.His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and capable management. These iron clad rules of value investing and his prowess to read Wall Street like a book has earned his securities portfolio impressive returns on investment for the past several years, a trend which continued this year too despite markets’ bull run.How Have the Markets Been This Year?The bull run of the U.S equity markets is now 9 years old, the second-longest in recent financial history. The 2017 boom was marked by Donald Trump’s take over of the White House, which pushed major indices to multiple highs on several occasions. The indices were favored by Trump’s pro growth policies to boost the economy and corporate profits, cut taxes, loosen regulations, increase spending and inflation.Trump promised to double the pace of economic growth from 2%, create 25 million jobs over 10 years, and make the domestic economy the strongest in the world. The positive sentiments sent the stock markets rallying.Performance of Buffett’s Equity PortfolioDespite equity markets’ strong rally, Buffett was able to emerge as a winner. The value of his investment portfolio as of Dec 31, 2017 was $157.65 billion, up 29% from Dec 31, 2016, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 17.2% during the same time frame. The top five positions account for nearly 60% of the portfolio: Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co., Apple Inc., (AAPL  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report).5 Stocks That OutperformedWhile Buffett’s portfolio includes equity investments in several publicly traded companies, some of them like Coca Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co. and Philips 66, which reserve big chunks, gave sub-par returns.Nevertheless, the portfolio returns outshone the markets. Here are some stocks that helped to deliver returns. Each has outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 22.5% year to date.Apple Inc. designs, manufactures and sells mobile communication devices (iPhone and iPad), media devices (iPod, Apple TV) personal computers (Mac), and related software, services, peripherals and networking solutions, worldwide.The stock, which comprised nearly 11.7% of the company’s investment portfolio as of Sep 30, 2017, has returned a good 53% year to date.

69,BRK.B,"Finance stocks have been gaining momentum on the back of the recent interest rate hikes by the Fed since the end of 2016. A decent interest-rate environment has favored almost all the industries under the Finance sector (except REITs). The sector’s stocks have witnessed solid revenue growth driven by higher investment income. The investment companies, banks, consumer loan companies, etc., have substantially benefitted from the rate hikes.The Fed’s decision to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to strengthen its balance sheet has also favored the Finance sector.So far in 2017, the unemployment rate has dipped to 4.2% accompanied by 2.9% year-over-year growth in the wage rate.

70,BRK.B,"All eyes are currently on the crucial two-day FOMC meeting slated to start today as the central bank is highly anticipated to raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 1.25-1.5% for the third time this year. Per the latest CME Group's FedWatch tool, the odds of a December rate hike is 96%. The Fed funds’ futures market shows 100% chance of a liftoff (read: December Rate Hike May Boost These ETFs).Investors are also keenly awaiting the Fed’s guidance on the 2018 rate trajectory.Hawkish Views for 2018Fed officials are expecting three rate hikes next year while a few firms like Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) predict faster rate hikes, may be up to four times, as the U.S. economy is heading into 2018 with strong momentum that is likely to boost wages and inflation.Meanwhile, Wall Street economists such as Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) are bracing for the biggest tightening of monetary policy in more than a decade. Average interest rates across advanced economies will likely climb to at least 1% next year to what would be the largest increase since 2006.This is especially true as the world’s largest economy is expanding at the fastest clip in three years with the best back-to-back quarters of at least 3% GDP growth and is near full employment confirmed by a strong November jobs report. Unemployment dropped to the lowest level since December 2000 to 4.1% (read: Sector ETFs to Win on Strong November Job Data).Further, Americans are highly optimistic about the economy with consumer confidence climbing to the highest level in 17 years. Moreover, Trump’s pro-growth policies to slash corporate taxes are nearing approval in Congress. If this happens, we will see an economic surge, boosting job growth and inflation. This signals faster rate increases in the coming years.Given the expectation of a tighter monetary policy, several ETFs are in focus ahead of the Fed meeting. A few ETFs will be rewarded if the Fed gives hawkish signals while a few will be severely impacted. Let’s have a look at both:ETFs to GainFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)A rising interest rate scenario would be highly profitable for the financial sector as a whole. This is because higher rates would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies and discount brokerage firms. The ultra-popular XLF, having AUM of $33.3 billion and average daily volume of 58 million shares, follows the Financial Select Sector Index. It holds 67 stocks in its basket with double-digit allocation to the top two firms Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase. In terms of industrial exposure, banks take the top spot at 44.6% while capital markets, insurance and diversified financial services make up for a double-digit exposure each. The fund charges 14 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish Fund (UUP  -  Free Report)Rising interest rates will pull in more capital into the country and lead to appreciation of the U.S. dollar. UUP is the prime beneficiary of a rising dollar as it offers exposure against a basket of six world currencies — euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. This is done by tracking the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index Futures Index Excess Return plus the interest income from the fund’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. The fund has so far managed an asset base of $596.3 million while sees an average daily volume of around 1.1 million shares. It charges 80 bps in total fees and expenses, and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity ETF (DBEF  -  Free Report)The diverging policy in the United States and the rest of the world would raise the appeal for currency-hedged ETFs. For those seeking exposure to the developed market with no currency risk, DBEF could be an intriguing pick. The fund follows the MSCI EAFE US Dollar Hedged Index and holds 944 securities in its basket, with none accounting for more than 1.8% share. It is skewed toward the financial sector with 21.3% of the portfolio, while industrials, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples round off the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. Among countries, Japan takes the top spot at 24.3%, closely followed by United Kingdom (17.4%) and France (10.8%). The ETF has AUM of $7 billion and trades in solid volume of nearly 1.7 million shares a day. It charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.ETFs to LoseSPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD  -  Free Report)Gold will be hit hard as higher interest rates would diminish the yellow metal’s attractiveness since it does not pay interest like fixed-income assets do. So, products tracking this bullion like GLD will lose. The fund tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U.S. dollars, and kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA. It is the ultra-popular gold ETF with AUM of $34 billion and average daily volume of around 7.1 million shares a day. Expense ratio comes in at 0.40%. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook (read: November ETF Asset Report: U.S. Tops, Treasuries Flop).iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG  -  Free Report)The high-yield corner of the fixed income world is the most watched area ahead of the Fed meeting. This is because higher rates would raise yields on Treasury notes, thereby fading the monopoly of high-yield bonds. HYG is the largest and most liquid fund in in the high-yield bond space with AUM of $19.2 billion and average daily volume of around 10.9 million shares. It tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid High Yield Index and holds 1,030 securities in the basket. Effective duration and average maturity come in at 3.63 and 4.23 years, respectively. The ETF charges 49 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) with a High risk outlook (see: Junk Bond ETFs Plunge to Seven-Month Low).iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM  -  Free Report)A rate hike would pull out more capital from the emerging markets, stirring up concerns for most nations. The most popular emerging market ETF – EEM – tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and charges 72 bps in annual fees from investors. Holding 861 securities, the product is widely spread out across various securities with none holding more than 5.52% of assets but is tilted toward the information technology and financials sectors at 28.5% and 23.2%, respectively. Among the emerging countries, China takes the top spot at 30% while South Korea and Taiwan round off the next two spots with a double-digit exposure each. The fund has AUM of $35.7 billion and trades in heavy volume of more than 50.6 million shares a day on average. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook (read: ETF Winners & Losers as Dollar Hits 13-Year High).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
