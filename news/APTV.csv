0,APTV,"Investors with an interest in Technology Services stocks have likely encountered both Aptiv (APTV  -  Free Report) and SailPoint Technologies (SAIL  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Aptiv has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while SailPoint Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that APTV's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.APTV currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.33, while SAIL has a forward P/E of 324.17. We also note that APTV has a PEG ratio of 1.29. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. SAIL currently has a PEG ratio of 19.45.Another notable valuation metric for APTV is its P/B ratio of 6.67. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, SAIL has a P/B of 7.11.Based on these metrics and many more, APTV holds a Value grade of B, while SAIL has a Value grade of F.APTV stands above SAIL thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that APTV is the superior value option right now.

2,APTV,"Aptiv PLC (APTV  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because APTV recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 3 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon.

3,APTV,"Delphi Technologies PLC (DLPH  -  Free Report) looks strong on the back of its vast global network and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies. The aftermarket business generates stable recurring revenues.Notably, Delphi Technologies reported strong first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share beat the consensus mark by 14 cents but were down by a penny from the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $1.30 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 billion. The figure was up 10.9% year over year on a reported basis and 5% on an adjusted basis.Despite such impressive results, we observe that shares of Delphi Technologies have declined 17.4% against the industry’s rise of 11.9% on a year-to-date basis. What’s Driving Delphi Technologies?Delphi Technologies has a geographically diverse revenue base. Region-wise, it derived 43.6% of revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), 27.5% from North America, 26% from the Asia Pacific and 2.7% from South America in first-quarter 2018. The company is highly optimistic about opportunities in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales from this region grew almost 16.5% to $339 million in the quarter. Increasing levels of vehicle production in the region is encouraging.Regional presence coupled with its diversified and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies should help Delphi Technologies become a solid choice for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This is because OEMS are focused on increasing efficiency and expanding their global manufacturing footprint by choosing suppliers with global scale who can easily adapt to regional variations.Additionally, Delphi Technologies is also optimistic about the opportunities from its aftermarket business. Through its aftermarket product portfolio, it offers an extensive range of solutions, which includes fuel injection, electronics and engine management, maintenance, and test equipment and vehicle diagnostics categories, to leading aftermarket companies, including independent retailers and wholesale distributors. Demand for aftermarket products and services depends on the growing number of vehicles, their life-cycles and total miles covered by them.

7,APTV,"The FIFA World Cup in Russia witnessed many surprises this time, including the defending champion Germany’s early exit. While some other favorites followed suit, team England gave a stunning performance, its best since the 1990 World Cup. A great world cup season helped boost U.K. stocks considerably. Additionally, Bank of England said that this World Cup will actually help Britain overcome the Brexit-related tensions.In addition to the optimism over the World Cup, recent economic data for the United Kingdom is upbeat, with solid increase in retail sales in June. In May, U.K. GDP increased steadily after the Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) reached its best levels since last October in June. Following these developments, investing in British companies that are expected to gain from the World Cup and strong GDP data looks like a prudent investment option.FIFA World Cup Brings Ample Gains For U.K.The United Kingdom, known as England in the World Cup, last won the coveted title way back in 1966. After that, the country reached the semis for the first time in 1990. Clearly, the country had to wait another 28 years to reach the semi-finals in this tournament.Following this development, in June, consumers invested significantly in barbecues, beer and big-screen televisions, which in turn boosted retail sales. In June, retail sales advanced 2.3% year over year, as per data by the British Retail Consortium (BRC).Retail sales have registered its second-best rise this year on the back of a steady rise in consumer spending. According to Barclaycard, overall consumer spending advanced 5.1% after spending in restaurants and pubs climbed around 10% in June. Also, BRC said that the “like-for-like sales” are up 1.1% year over year.World Cup Soothes Brexit-Induced WorriesOn Jul 5, Bank of England’s (BOE) Governor Mark Carney showed his optimism over England’s success in the World Cup. Carney said that England winning the 2018 soccer title on Jul 15 in Moscow, will be an “unadulterated, unalloyed good” for the economy of the country.World Cup joys come at a time when the United Kingdom is reeling under Brexit-related tensions, when Britain’s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis have resigned. This has raised prospects of a new election and pushed Brexit negotiations into murkier waters.Separately, per the British Beer and Pub Association, additional sales of beer following the World Cup will bring around £4.5 million in the form of tax collections. Pub retailers like Greene King have already stated that it sold an additional 500,000 pints during the match between England and Panama. Some other pub operators like Marston and EI Group are also expected to gain from England reaching the semis.Britain’s GDP Rise & Services PMI Shine in JuneAccording to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Britain’s GDP growth for the month of May was 0.3%, better than April’s 0.2% rise. May’s GDP growth led the economic growth to 0.2% during March-May period, higher than February-April’s 0% increase. Strong services sector performance boosted the GDP for the three months ended May.IHS Markit/CIPS services PMI rose from 54 in May to 55.1 in June. The country’s non-manufacturing activity not only expanded last month, but also reached its highest settlement in the last eight months. Overall services activity increased 0.4% in the second quarter.5 British Stocks to Buy NowWith England sailing through the quarterfinals and now geared up to face Croatia in the second semi-final, U.K. clearly has a lot more to gain.

9,APTV,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are seven of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:Anthem Inc.

Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are seven of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

12,APTV,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Russia from Jun 14 to Jul 15. With less than two weeks left for this month-long mega football event, the British economy is expected to gain from this event. Although revenue generation in the U.K. will not come directly from the FIFA World Cup, British entertainment companies, retailers, and restaurant chains are expected to gain from the event.Along with optimism from the World Cup, recent economic data for the United Kingdom is quite encouraging. Both U.K. manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) registered a noticeable increase in May. Following these developments, investing in British companies that are expected to gain from the World Cup and strong manufacturing and services sectors looks like a prudent investment option.FIFA World Cup to Bring Billions for U.K.Per data from British think-tank, World Advertising Research Center (WARC), the World Cup will bring £1.33 billion or around $1.78 billion for the U.K. economy. Moreover, the figure may total to even £2.72 billion or about $3.64 billion if England reaches the final stage of the event. According to U.K.-based digital marketplace VoucherCodes, a large number of British retailers and brands will be gaining from the World Cup.Per VoucherCodes, the British hospitality sector is expected to make £193 million or $258 million. Additionally, revenues from barbecues and garden parties are estimated to be around £37 million or more than $49 million. Further, expenditure on sportswear items including team jerseys will be around £264 million or about $353 million.Moreover, football fans who will watch the matches at home are projected to spend £240 million or $321 million on food and £297 million or $397 million on alcohol. In fact, TV audiences will separately spend £277 million or $370 million to get a better experience of the World Cup. The numbers for all these sectors are expected to increase even further if England becomes one of the two finalists of the mega event.Additionally, marketing director of VoucherCodes, Jimmy New, said that the FIFA World Cup will turn out to be a big event for both the football fans and British retailers. He added that a massive £1.33 billion is expected to be generated “over the next couple of months to celebrate the occasion.”Britain’s Manufacturing & Services PMI Shine in MayAccording to IHS Markit / CIPS, manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) increased from the April’s reading of 53.9 to 54.4 in May. British manufacturing activity recovered in May after touching a 17-year low in April. Finished goods inventories registered its best increase since the commencement of the survey 26 years back, which along with a strong decline in backlogs boosted manufacturing PMI in May.Additionally, IHS Markit/CIPS services PMI rose from 52.8 in April to 54 in May. The country’s non-manufacturing activity not only expanded last month but also reached its highest settlement in the last three months. Increase in new work orders in the services sector and fading concerns over bad weather boosted the index.5 British Stocks to Buy NowThe 2018 World Cup may not help in direct revenue generation for British stocks but these companies are expected to gain significantly from the sporting event.

13,APTV,"With a highly anticipated royal wedding on the docket for this weekend — if you’ve been living under a rock, Prince Harry will be wed to American actress and humanitarian activist Meghan Markle Saturday, mid-day in England and very early in the a.m. U.S. time — we thought it might be worthwhile to take a peek at the performance of British-oriented stocks. Especially now that the Brexit decision voted on nearly 2 years ago is finally being enacted, we may be seeing different forecasts for some of our favorite English stocks.This is hardly the only article featuring such equities, by the way, even here at Zacks.com. We published a separate study of top-rated British companies earlier this week here: Royal Wedding, Record Job Growth Aid U.K. Economy: 5 PicksIntegrated oil super-major BP Inc. (BP  -  Free Report) is clearly not feeling any negative effects from Brexit activity; Brent crude oil prices recently having hit $80 per barrel are assisting this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, with its Zacks Style Score (Value - Growth - Momentum) of A. Its neighbors in the sector are also doing well overall — BP sits in the top 13% of Zacks Industry Rank and top 25% in Sector Rank.Shares are down slightly in today’s pre-market, but have been steadily climbing back from the fall in oil prices a few years back. That said, BP shares are still off their multi-year highs experienced just prior to the company’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was raging at this time 8 years ago. But BP stock is up a couple dollars per share over the past month.Big Pharma company AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) also boasts a Zacks Style Score of A, with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). However, it resides in a sector within the bottom 31% on the Zacks scale. The company is well diversified, but did suffer a setback recently with its asthma treatment Fasenra having failed a COPD study. Shares are down a bit ahead of the opening bell today, but continue to trade in a range just beneath its all-time highs hit just a few years ago.County Kent’s own Delphi Automotive (APTV  -  Free Report), an auto tech specialty company featuring solutions in auto emissions and fuel economy, currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). However, its Style Score is D, on relatively lagging Growth and Momentum. But it proudly hails at all-time market highs, even if it closed slightly lower than yesterday’s record high $98.50 per share (U.S.).

16,APTV,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE).

17,APTV,"The British economy expanded 0.1% sequentially in Q1, slowing from a 0.4% rise in the previous period and falling short of 0.3% market expectations. It marked the weakest growth rate since a 0.1% shrinkage seen in the fourth quarter of 2012. A decline in construction and slowing manufacturing growth caused the economy to expand so stealthily.If these were not enough, the latest data revealed that U.K. inflation suddenly slowed in March to the lowest level in a year. The rate of inflation in the U.K. dropped to 2.5% in March 2018 from 2.7% in the prior month and below market expectations of 2.7%.Bad weather took some of the blame for the GDP disaster but still it stirred questions in investors’ minds as to whether the British economy is healthy enough to survive policy tightening.  According to an analyst, “slower growth in consumer spending likely stems from slower real wage growth even as nominal wages have increased.”All these meant that the Bank of England will not dive into the policy tightening mode in a low inflation and growth scenario. Last time, Bank of England (BoE) hiked its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% was in November 2017. That was the first hike since July 2007 intended at curbing inflation (read: U.K. Hikes Interest Rates: ETFs in Focus).If this was not enough, the governor of BoE Mark Carney sent sterling on a downhill ride by acknowledging the likely economic contagion from Brexit and suggesting a delay in the next interest rate hike. All these poured cold water on market odds that the bank is preparing for a move in May.PowerShares CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling Trust (FXB  -  Free Report) lost about 1.1% in the past two trading sessions (as of Apr 28, 2018) to reflect slowing GDP data and was down 1.3% in the last five days.ETFs & Stocks to Buy Against this backdrop, investors can consider U.K. ETFs and stocks. Below we highlight a few products for investors (see all European Equity ETFs here).ETF Picks Deutsche X-trackers MSCI United Kingdom Hedged Equity Fund (DBUK  -  Free Report)The underlying MSCI United Kingdom US Dollar Hedged Index looks to provide exposure to the equity market of the United Kingdom, while at the same time mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and British pound sterling.

18,APTV,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed the half-way mark, with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.According to the latest Earnings Preview, 267 S&P 500 companies have already reported results. Earnings for these companies increased 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% outpaced earnings estimates and 73.8% exceeded top-line expectations. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 61.4%. Notably, more than 900 companies (including 142 S&P 500 members) will report results this week.Bullish Q1 ViewFor the S&P 500 index, total first-quarter 2018 earnings are expected to increase 22.6% on 8.4% higher revenues. Notably, the last reported quarter witnessed 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% increase in revenues.For full-year 2018, total earnings are expected to improve 18.5% on 5.5% higher revenues.A Rosy Picture for Business ServicesPer the above report, companies in the Business Services sector are expected to record top- and bottom-line growth of 5.2% and 17.1%, respectively. Notably, 13 out of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the ongoing earnings season with double-digit earnings growth.One of those sectors is the Business Services. Usually, this sector is directly proportional to the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable. In fact, a rise in GDP, record-low unemployment level, strong job additions, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, which in turn, should boost the sector’s performance. Trump’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts, and repeal of regulations are additional tailwinds.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on May 2Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), a business process outsourcing services provider, will report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,667 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.5%. The same for earnings per share stands at $1.44, indicating year-over-year growth of 9.9%.In the yet-to-be-reported quarter, the company’s top line is expected to benefit from higher organic growth, favorable foreign currency movements and acquisitions.

21,APTV,"A significant decline in inflation across the pond came as a breather for the key U.K. indexes on Apr 18. Lower inflation, along with a nominal increase in wages and disappointing manufacturing and industrial production data ultimately reduced concerns of a rate increase as early as May by the Bank of England (BOE).Recent economic data also weighed on the pound sterling, which turns out to be a boon for British blue-chip giants that generate their revenues in foreign currencies. Moreover, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its growth projection for the United Kingdom recently, in its World Economic Outlook report. Following these developments, investing in big British companies looks like a prudent investment option. Inflation Weakest in a Year, Wages Up Only 0.2%According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS)data, Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell from 2.7% in February to 2.5% in March, reaching its lowest settlement in a year. The CPI inflation data was also lower than the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee’s recent projection of 2.8%.Additionally, core CPI data came in at 2.3% last month, lower than 2.4% registered in February. Core CPI also reached its lowest level in a year. Key inflation data is slowly moving toward the Bank of England’s (BOE) desired target of 2%. Moreover, decline in food prices also weighed on producer price performance, with Producer Price Index (PPI) coming in at 4.2% in March - its lowest since 2016.Decline in CPI and PPI data is expected to weigh on the Bank of England’s ability to raise key interest rates as early as in May.Moreover, following a fall in key inflation metrics, prospects of a November rate hike fell to less than 40% from the previous forecast of 50%, per Bloomberg.Also, the unemployment rate declined from 4.7% to 4.2% during the same period. However, wages including bonuses rose merely 0.2% in the “real terms,” which also weighed on recent rate hike prospects.Pound Sterling Plummets, IMF Raises Growth ProjectionsFurther, U.K.’s industrial production advanced only 0.1% in February from January, while manufacturing output fell by 0.2% in February. Weak industrial and manufacturing output, along with fall in inflation and slow wage growth also weighed on the pound sterling.Earlier this week, the pound sterling rose to $1.43, settling at its best levels since Britain decided to exit the European Union (EU) in June 2016. However, following the release of the new economic data, the pound sterling declined. Most of the big British companies and blue-chips have significant exposure in the global market. Thus, a weak sterling is expected to have a positive impact on these behemoths.On Apr 17, the IMF showed optimism in the British economy’s growth potential as it raised its year-over-year economic growth projection from the earlier 1.5% to 1.6%. IMF gave a stronger projection for the U.K. following a better global economic growth outlook.5 British Stocks to Buy NowFollowing the fall in inflation, wages, industrial and manufacturing production, rate hike worries have abated. Additionally, a weaker pound has brought focus back on British stocks that have strong foothold in the international market. Also, strong U.K. and global economy outlook have made these big British companies a strong bet for investorsIn this context, we have selected five British stocks that are expected to gain following these developments.

23,APTV,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Aptiv PLC (APTV  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in APTV.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $6.77  share a month ago to its current level of $4.74.Also, for the current quarter, Aptiv has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.31 a share from $1.82 over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15.9% in the past month.Delphi Automotive PLC Price and Consensus Delphi Automotive PLC Price and Consensus | Delphi Automotive PLC QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Technology Services industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Luna Innovations Incorporated (LUNA  -  Free Report).
