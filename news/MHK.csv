4,MHK,"Global carpet and flooring leader Mohawk Industries (MHK) is benefiting from a resurgent U.S. home construction and remodeling market, which has boosted sales and lifted its stock to new heights.Shares of the Calhoun, Ga.-based company reached an all-time high of 214.93 on Aug. 8, two trading days after Mohawk reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and guided earnings higher for the third quarter.Mohawk believes demand for flooring products like luxury vinyl tile will remain strong, and it is aggressively ramping up its production capacity. But so are its rivals, raising concerns about future oversupply.Mohawk has earned praise from Wall Street for increasing its profitability and for making well-timed acquisitions that have widened its scope. But organic growth lately has been sluggish. Last quarter, organic sales grew just 3%.""Mohawk has been lagging on organic growth, and flooring as a category has been lagging as well,"" Macquarie Securities analyst Mike Wood told IBD. ""Mohawk has done a phenomenal job with earnings growth, but it hasn't been on the top line.""Another concern for Mohawk is that some patents on its flooring products are expiring next year, and the company will have to find a way to make up for the resulting lost royalty payments in other areas of its business or it will see its earnings growth slow.The loss of patent protection for its Unilin interlocking flooring tiles will hurt earnings per share by about 3% or 4% next year, Baird analyst Timothy Wojs told IBD.But Mohawk could compensate through improved productivity at new plants or perhaps an acquisition.Mohawk generates more than 70% of its revenue in North America. It gets about 80% of sales from residential and 20% from commercial end markets.The company started out in carpets but has diversified through acquisitions into ceramic tile, laminate, wood and vinyl flooring. Its products are sold under such brands as American Olean, Bigelow, Daltile, Durkan, Karastan, Lees, Marazzi, Pergo, Unilin, Quick-Step and IVC.Mohawk still has merger opportunities worldwide.""They're the largest flooring company in the world, but globally they have less than 10% market share,"" Wojs said.Mohawk has operations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and elsewhere in Europe, as well as the U.S.The fastest-growing category for Mohawk is luxury vinyl tile. Sales of that product have been limited by its manufacturing capacity, Chief Executive Jeff Lorberbaum said on a conference call with analysts Aug. 5.""By the end of next year, we will double our U.S. LVT capacity and enhance our capabilities in this fast-growing category,"" he said.Luxury vinyl tile can look like wood or ceramic but is sturdier. It's also much cheaper than wood or laminate flooring.Mohawk has $500 million in luxury vinyl tile production capacity now and will be up to $1 billion by the end of next year.But competitors like Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-owned Shaw Industries, Mannington and Armstrong World Industries (AWI) also are adding luxury vinyl tile capacity.""There's this big fear that once all this new capacity comes online, the margin implodes,"" Wood said. But Wood is confident that won't happen because the new capacity will produce a better-quality product than what's being made elsewhere.This year, Mohawk anticipates capital expenditures of more than $600 million as it adds advanced manufacturing plants.""From 2013 through 2016, we will have invested about $2 billion in new assets to drive Mohawk's profitability,"" CEO Lorberbaum said in a statement. ""We have substantially integrated our recent acquisitions, and with our strong organization and balance sheet, we can exploit additional opportunities. In every region, our differentiated product collections, operational excellence and extensive customer relationships give us advantages so we can deliver strong results.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall raised his price target on Mohawk stock to 245 from 220 on Aug. 8 and maintained his outperform rating.""Elevated capital spending levels resulting in market share gains and productivity improvements are already accelerating earnings growth,"" Wetenhall said in a report. ""A dominant competitive position, consistent execution, and a history of accretive M&A activity support our outperform recommendation.""IBD'S TAKE: Mohawk has been climbing out of a year-long flat base and reached an all-time intraday high of 214.93 on Aug. 8. Shares remain close to that level. In Monday trades, shares were up fractionally to 212.77. Mohawk ranks third in the building and construction products group behind Acuity Brands (AYI), a fixture on IBD's Leaderboard.Baird's Wojs raised his price target on Mohawk stock to 235 from 222 and reiterated his outperform rating on Aug. 5.Mohawk has a track record of solid execution and growth through acquisitions, he said. Wojs believes Mohawk can see compound annual growth of 20% in earnings per share over the next few years.Mohawk has posted 18 straight quarters of double-digit gains in earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.In the second quarter, it earned $3.47 a share excluding items, up 29% year over year, on sales of $2.31 billion, up 13%.For the current quarter, Mohawk guided to adjusted EPS of $3.40-$3.49, when Wall Street was looking for $3.37. Mohawk's guidance points to EPS growth of 14% to 17% year over year.Mohawk's major competitive advantage is its direct relationship with independent flooring retailers and its logistics expertise, Wood said. Other companies have to sell through distributors.The U.S. flooring market is estimated to have generated $21.8 billion in revenue for manufacturers in 2014. The market peaked at $25.4 billion in 2005 before being impacted by the housing downturn. It fell to $17.1 billion in 2009.Flooring demand has been on the upswing thanks to improved consumer confidence, increased remodeling spending and growth in housing starts, Wojs said.Flooring sales have lagged other building product categories in the turnaround, he said.""It's a big-ticket, discretionary product -- you can live with an ugly floor,"" Wojs said. ""That type of product has taken a while to come back. But home prices continue to rise, consumer confidence continues to be in a good spot, and that's what drives a lot of big-ticket, discretionary purchases. We think flooring is an area you could start to see increased investment over the next couple of years, and Mohawk will participate in that.""

14,MHK,"Whip out the shades. Acuity Brands' (AYI) fourth quarter shined brighter than Wall Street expected, easing worries about possible dimming as the LED-lighting-fixture company looked toward future smart street lights and interconnected systems.Shares recently faced pressure after rival Eaton (ETN) said at the Citi Industrials Conference on Sept. 17 that lighting had been weak since July, recalls Cowen & Co. analyst Jeffrey Osborne. But Acuity's 29% Q4 earnings growth to $1.63 a share and 14% revenue rise to $759.5 million pleased investors Wednesday, sending shares up 3.7%. Analysts had expected $1.62 on $754.9 million in Q4.For the year, per-share earnings grew 36% to $5.39, topping views by a penny. Revenue grew 13% to $2.71 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates of $2.7 billion.""I think investors went into the call with lower expectations of growth rates because of industrial peer commentary,"" Stifel analyst Sven Eenmaa told IBD. But Acuity showed ""very strong execution. That is clearly a positive. It looks like not a whole lot has changed in terms of market growth. Execution remains strong. They're executing on strategy.""Sales grew across most product categories and regions, with LED-based lighting solutions accounting for more than half of total Q4 net sales. And LED product sales grew ""by almost 50%"" this last quarter, CEO Vernon Nagel told analysts.Seven Years Ago: What's LED?Contrast this to seven years ago, when Acuity ""sold virtually no LED-based fixtures."" Nagel said the company invested ""significantly"" to become the digital-lighting market leader.He also noted that the key nonresidential construction market is still about 20% off its 2008 peak, while Acuity's net sales have grown 34% over that time. Acuity's business is split fairly evenly between new construction and renovation.""Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and full year were records for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio ... a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things,"" said Nagel.Interconnectedness is growing as ""smart"" homes and commercial buildings tap into the so-called Internet of Things.Buying Distech Controls, a building-automation and energy-management firm, ""makes a lot of sense"" for Acuity, said Cowen's Osborne. Distech integrates lights, HVAC, closed-circuit television and other energy efficiency systems.""The Holy Grail is to have a platform that can be the quarterback of that system,"" he said. ""Distech is one of the building blocks.""Management expects that its acquisition of Distech, completed in September, will be ""modestly accretive"" to the company in fiscal 2016. Acuity disclosed on Monday a partnership with Silver Spring Networks to co-develop a ""networked street-light control solution"" for cities, utilities and other networks, including ""smart"" street lights that can automatically dim or brighten depending on the weather.Internet Of Things Needs TimeAnalysts say Acuity's foray into the Internet of Things is mostly strategic and has yet to affect revenue, but the company could start to see material results in few years.""It remains a largely lighting and LED story, but they're sowing the seeds to drive growth here a couple of years (out),"" said Eenmaa.Acuity is a member of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group, which ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups. Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS), Apogee Enterprises (APOG) and Mohawk Industries (MHK) are among its publicly traded peers in the group.Aside from Eaton, Acuity's competitors in the lighting space include Hubbell (HUBB), Philips (PHG), General Electric (GE) and several smaller companies.Lower-cost LED products have helped Acuity. Conversely, the trend has weighed on LED light-bulb maker Cree (CREE), which said in June that it would restructure its LED business to reflect overcapacity and downtrending prices.Cree shares are off 20% this year. Acuity stock is up 30% to 182.69.Strength In DiversificationAnalysts wonder about the August decline of AIA's Architecture Billings Index (ABI), a nonresidential building activity indicator. The index dipped below the key 50 mark to 49.1 from July's 54.7, though AIA's chief economist, Kermit Baker, said the ""minor dip should be quickly reversed.""Acuity is well-diversified enough to withstand August's downtick, said Stifel's Eenmaa.Acuity does not provide earnings guidance, but management highlighted the improving North American economy and consensus estimates for the region's lighting industry to grow in the ""mid- to upper-single-digit range"" for the company's fiscal 2016.Nagel expects its gross profit margin to ""improve over time.""Outpacing The MarketManagement is optimistic about its growth prospects.""Further, we expect to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve by executing our strategies to focus on growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, expand into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and grow from the continued introduction of new products and lighting solutions as part of our integrated, tiered solutions strategy,"" said Nagel.

16,MHK,"Take some growth stocks, put them in with some value stocks, and what do you get? A core mutual fund. Some growth mutual funds own a few value stocks and some value funds own some growth stocks. But some funds own too much of each type to be classified as growth or value in Morningstar's eyes. So core makes a home for those funds.There are times when the stock market favors each style over the others. Value mutual funds hold stocks that in aggregate have below-average price-earnings and price-to-book values.Value investors see such stocks as having less risk and great potential for price appreciation. Their prices are already depressed, and so most of the hot money is out of them already. They could rise as investors discover the stocks' potential.Growth investors seek companies with above-average earnings and sales growth, and potential continued growth. The ability to grab market share or expand new markets is a hallmark of these stocks. They often have higher than average P-E and price-book values as growth investors tend to be willing to pay up for companies able to achieve rapid growth.John Hancock Large Cap Equity has both types of stocks in its recent top holdings. Sandy Sanders and Walter McCormick have managed the $3.7 billion fund since 2011 and Jonathan White since March this year.Facebook (FB) has grown earnings at a 70% annual pace for the past three years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that its earnings will climb 18% this year and 33% next year. By comparison, the S&P 500's EPS growth is expected to be -1.03% for 2015 and 8.90% for 2016, notes Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ.The stock has climbed 24% this year, near an all-time high, and is trading at about 51 times trailing 12-month earnings or three times the level of the S&P 500, a proxy for the broad stock market.Oracle (ORCL) used to be a growth stock, but its annual earnings growth pace has been a subdued 3% the past three years and 9% the past five years. Its stock is 21% off its 52-week high and is trading at 14 times earnings, or about 20% less than the S&P 500's P-E. Earnings of the developer of database systems are seen falling 5% this year fiscal year, which ends in May, but rising 10% next year. It's got a dividend growth rate of 28% and a dividend yield of 1.6%.John Hancock Large Cap Equity is a top-performing core fund, having risen an average annual 10.6% the past 10 years vs. 7.86% for the S&P 500. This year, the fund has handed investors a 4% gain vs. the broad stock market index's 0.27% gain.The average core fund tracked by Morningstar rose an average annual 9.05% the past 10 years but is down 2% this year.Follow Doug Rogers on Twitter: @IBD_DRogers.

18,MHK,"Whatever the Federal Reserve decides on Thursday, the market seems to already be making this point: Don't lose confidence in the American consumer. Judging by the makeup of the weekly Big Cap 20 list (there was no list in the Sept. 8 edition, due to the long Labor Day weekend), institutional money appears to be flowing nicely into various stocks that reflect the state of consumer spending in the world's No. 1 economy.They include Mohawk Industries (MHK). The flooring specialist was No. 19 in the Aug. 18 edition. Today, it ranks in the top 10.The consumer sector contingent also includes Priceline Group (PCLN), which has gotten a lot bigger via acquisitions and entry into new travel-related markets; video game software giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI); Delta Air Lines (DAL), which scored $40.9 billion in sales in the most recent four quarters and has averaged 26% EPS growth in the past three quarters; and Under Armour (UA), the Baltimore-based sportswear and shoemaker that has become a global brand just like its top rivals Adidas and Nike (NKE).The large contingent of health care stocks in the list also bespeaks the strengthening confidence of American households as jobs are more plentiful and joblessness has come down to 5.1% vs. 10% in October 2009.Mohawk represents the rebound in the home improvement and housing industries as home owners and sellers update their flooring. Acquisitions have boosted growth in the past. However, top line growth has slowed to a low single-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. In the second quarter of this year, sales were flat at $2.04 billion.So why has Mohawk been able to grow its earnings per share 20% or faster over the same five-quarter period?According to an RBC Capital Markets analyst quoted by IBD in August, Mohawk enjoyed improved productivity, lower raw material costs and synergies from its June 2015 merger with companies such as IVC Group, which specializes in sheet vinyl, luxury vinyl tile and laminate.In May, Mohawk completed its buy of KAI to attain the leading position in the Bulgarian and Romanian ceramic tiling markets.Priceline has expanded its online travel booking business from hotels and airline flights into rental cars and private driver services. More recently, it's grabbed space quickly in the online restaurant reservations field with its 2014 buy of OpenTable and an announcement Sept. 3 to acquire AS Digital. The Melbourne, Australia-based firm has seated 250 million diners through its software.Priceline CEO Darren Huston noted that in Q2, the firm saw a second straight quarter of accelerating growth in both hotel room nights and rental car days booked.

23,MHK,"Investors will find out how housing-related stocks Caesarstone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) and Mohawk Industries (MHK) fared in the second quarter when they report results in coming days.If analysts are right, the results will be a mixed bag.Caesarstone, an Israeli quartz surface maker, is expected to end its recent streak of double-digit profit growth when it reports the quarter's results on Wednesday before the market opens. But sales growth is expected to accelerate from the prior quarter as the high rated maker of counter tops, vanities and other quartz surfaces benefits from the ongoing housing recovery and uptick in remodeling spending.High rated Mohawk, a global flooring manufacturer, is seen posting its 14th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth when it reports results for the second quarter on Thursday. But the growth rate is seen slowing from the prior quarter. Sales growth is expected to be about the same as the prior quarter.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Caesarstone's earnings to rise 7% to 62 cents a share. That would mark the smallest quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of 2011. But sales are expected to pick up the pace from the prior quarter, rising 15.6% to $134.22 million. That would be higher than the 14% increase in the prior quarter.Mohawk Industries is expected to see earnings rise 19% to $2.63 a share. That would be slower than the 38% increase it posted in the prior quarter. It would mark the company's smallest quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of 2011. Sales are seen rising 4.3% to $2.136 billion. That would follow a 4% gain in the prior quarter.Business at both Caesarstone and Mohawk is tied to remodeling and residential construction trend.In June, housing starts soared 26.6% in June from a year ago, while building permits, which signals future activity, surged 30%, according to the Commerce Dept.Mohawk and Caesarstone are a part of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group. Caesarstone has a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, while Mohawk has a Composite Rating of 96. The group also includes highly rated Acuity Brands (AYI) and Masco (MAS).

24,MHK,"Powered by rising home sales and prices, and lots of pent-up demand, the pace of remodeling spending is positioned to pick up. Industry experts expect remodeling spending to see a nice uptick this year amid strengthening housing market fundamentals, though they vary on just how much.
"
25,MHK,"A recent flurry of good news on key housing indicators bodes well for remodeling:In June, existing home sales rose 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million from May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales are now at their highest level since February 2007 and are up 9.6% from a year earlier.The median existing home price for all housing types in June was $236,400, up 6.5% from a year earlier and above the peak median sales price of $230,400 set in July 2006, says the NAR.Suppliers Stand OutA rise in remodeling spending should aid high-rated companies such as giant home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD), top home improvement and building products makerMasco (MAS), and global flooring company Mohawk Industries (MHK). These companies stand to benefit from increased spending on home spruce-ups like new flooring and renovations such as kitchen redos, the type of projects that may have been deferred in the past.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Masco, Home Depot and Mohawk to see double digit year-over-year profit growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017. They expect Israeli quartz surface maker Caesarstone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) to see double-digit profit growth in 2016 and 2017.""We think by the end of the year remodeling spending nationally will reach an all-time high,"" Kermit Baker, senior research fellow at Harvard's Joint Center For Housing Studies, told IBD. ""It looks like it's almost fully recovered from the (housing) downturn, where new construction is still well below where it was before the downturn.""Broadly, we're expecting to see mid-to-low single-digit growth in remodeling this year and then it will begin to accelerate at the end of the year moving into 2016 for the next year or two,"" said Baker, who directs the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard's housing center.Total home improvement and repair spending peaked at just under $325 billion in 2007, he says. The Joint Center estimates it will rise 2.5% in 2015 from a year earlier to $325 billion. Baker projects spending growth will probably get to the long-term trend of 5% until there's another downturn.Home-Price Gains Are PivotalThe single most important trend driving the Joint Center's forecast is recovering home prices, he says.""Seeing home prices recover is crucial to consumers having the confidence to undertake a remodeling,"" he said.Another driver, he adds, is the fact that homeowners who had deferred some projects during the downturn from 2008 to 2011 are now ""attacking the list of projects they put off.""Such projects include bath and kitchen remodels and room additions. Baker says these types of projects have seen the ""strongest recovery"" from the downturn and should continue to do so as the market continues to grow.The Joint Center's key metric for tracking the growth of improvement spending specifically on owner-occupied properties is the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA).The LIRA provides a short-term outlook of national homeowner improvement spending, estimating the annual rate of change in spending for the current quarter and prior three quarters. In Q3 that four-quarter moving total is forecast to reach $151.1 billion.The LIRA projects annual home-improvement spending growth of 2.8% in 2015 accelerating to 4% by the first quarter of 2016, says Joint Center research analyst Abbe Will.""Major drivers of this anticipated growth are the recent pick-up in home sales activity, sustained growth in retail sales of home improvement products and ongoing gains in house prices across much of the country,"" Will said.The biggest ""trigger"" for remodeling spending, says Baker, is the sale of a home, particularly an older one.Ken Fears, director of housing, finance and regional economics for the NAR, says there's a ""strong correlation"" between home sales and remodeling.""With an increase in home sales volumes, you're likely to see an increase in remodeling because people will have a source of funds from the sale to tap into to do the remodeling,"" he said.He expects remodeling trends to ""track the general trend"" for existing home sales.The NAR forecasts existing home sales will rise 6.6% this year, followed by a 4.1% gain in 2016.A Different ViewThe National Association of Home Builders calculates remodeling spending differently from how the Joint Center does it.NAHB senior economist Michael Neal says residential remodeling spending on owner-occupied properties fell by 24.3% from a year earlier in 2014 after it was hurt by harsh weather in the year's first half and kept falling in the second half.""However, because of the severity of the fall, the level of private residential improvement spending in 2015 will be below its level in 2014, by about 12%,"" Neal told IBD.""But beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, private residential improvements spending will exceed its year-ago level, and year-over-year growth will continue into 2016 and 2017, by 13.2% and 3.1% respectively.""Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says he expects to see a ""continued uptick"" in spending on larger-ticker home remodel projects such as kitchen and bath remodels.""I think we will see very strong same-store sales growth from the home improvement retailers,"" he told IBD.Keith notes that comments from both Home Depot and Lowe's Cos. (LOW) management indicate that sales volumes in certain categories such as lumber and concrete ""that are often utilized in larger-ticket projects are still well off their total previous highs in 2006 or 2007.""Large Projects Get UnderwayMorningstar analyst James Krapfel, who covers companies such as Masco and Mohawk, concurs that the mix of remodel and repair spending has ""shifted to more expensive projects, like full kitchen remodels, that tend to carry higher margins for the companies.""Daren Blomquist, vice president at property data tracker RealtyTrac, says due to rising home prices more people have equity in their homes than in the past. RealtyTrac research shows that people who have a mortgage and are ""equity rich,"" with at least 50% equity in their homes, have grown to 10.9 million this year, or about 20% of all homeowners with a mortgage, up from 9.9 million last year.""That puts more people in a good position to take out a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) and use (the funds) to remodel their homes,"" he told IBD. ""In the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, we saw a jump in HELOCs as more people regained their equity and felt comfortable enough to leverage that equity.""Current low interest rates may well prompt homeowners to take out some form of financing sooner rather than later, says Andres Carbacho-Burgos, associate director at Moody's Analytics.""Interest rates are so low now on whichever form of financing you look at, people may think if they're going to improve their homes and have to borrow to do so for large projects, now is the time,"" he said. ""They may think 'if I wait two to three years to borrow to pay for this I may have to pay higher rates.'""

89,MHK,"Many investors are drawn to low-priced stocks like bears to honey. Truth is, it's an area of the market where institutional investors rarely fish. That means you shouldn't fish there, either.Prior to today, seven columns in this space have addressed the question: What makes a great base? Today's column is a reminder that when looking for good price setups, make sure stocks are priced at least $10 a share or higher.Retail shoppers love bargains. But in the stock market, what seems like a bargain usually isn't. Cheap stocks are usually cheap for a reason.Of course, it just sounds better buying 1,000 shares of a $1 stock as opposed to 10 shares of a $100 stock. The $1 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a tidy $1,000 profit. Meanwhile, the $100 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a $10 profit.Which sounds better? The logic may be flawed, but it's human nature to favor cheap stocks. Of course, there are stocks priced under 10 in IBD's database that have compelling fundamentals. Some have excellent Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength and Composite Ratings. ( Click on the IBD University tab at Investors.com to learn more about all of these ratings.)But it's not easy making money in low-priced stocks. It's a risky area of the market because most low-priced names lack a critical trait seen in past stock market winners: institutional sponsorship.Why do top mutual fund managers tend to shun low-priced stocks? Because they like liquidity, and cheap stocks rarely have it. Fund managers like to move into and out of a stock without being noticed. They can do that with liquid, highly priced names — not with illiquid ones.Fund managers like to focus on firms with an exceptional track record of earnings and sales growth. This is not easy to find in the low-priced space, where many firms talk the talk but can't walk the walk.It's not that money can't be made in low-priced stocks. It's just that the odds are much less in your favor.Truth is, some of the most profitable breakouts can come from higher-priced names. Not surprisingly, since they're more on the radar of institutional investors.""Expensive"" Often Is Not SoThe second half of 2012 yielded some powerful breakouts from institutional-quality names, as seen in the table above.MasterCard (MA) cleared a pre-split buy point of 448.10 in September 2012.

265,MHK,"We are again at the starting point of another earnings season, the first one for this year. Earnings outcome of companies play a key role in gauging the performance, helping investors with their investment decisions. As we stand to witness another thrilling season, let’s focus on some expectations.Initial results from the S&P 500 cohort indicate that Q1 earnings started on a strong note with a considerably higher proportion of companies, posting positive earnings surprises. Further, the earnings and revenue growth rates were also noteworthy. However, there has been a slowdown in the positive revenue surprise trend compared with the previous quarter. Nevertheless, the proportion was almost comparable with the historic levels.Moreover, we note that estimates for the current quarter (Q2) are reasonably stable since the start of the Q1 reporting cycle. While this is too early to expect movement in the estimates, we believe that the chances of estimate revision will improve as we move into the core Q1 earnings season.Per the Earnings Preview dated Apr 20, only 87 S&P 500 members have reported earnings so far, leaving us with more than 680 companies, including 178 S&P 500 members, to come up with their results. So far, we have seen total earnings improve 25% year over year, with revenue gains of 10.7%. Of these, 82.8% have topped earnings estimates while 67.8% beat revenue estimates. This brings the combined beat ratio to 62.1%.Putting together the results so far and forward expectations, total earnings for the S&P 500 are estimated to improve 18.3%, with 7.7% increase in revenues. Based on these expectations, this earnings season is likely to witness the best performance in six years.A Glimpse of Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which, 14 are estimated to witness year-over-year earnings growth. The Consumer Discretionary sector mainly houses major media stocks, leisure & recreation service providers, schools, gaming, household appliances, furniture and more. Per the report, the Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 7.2% while revenues are expected to increase 6.8% this earnings season.Currently, the Consumer Discretionary sector is ranked among the bottom 38% (10 of 16) of all the Zacks sectors. The sector has rallied 5.1% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 market’s gain of 12.2%.So, let’s see what awaits the two stocks from the sector that are queued up for earnings releases on Apr 26.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of delivering positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Key Predictions for LEG and MHKLeggett & Platt Inc. (LEG  -  Free Report), the producer and seller of furniture and other engineered goods for office and home, carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Moreover, its Earnings ESP of-6.17% makes a surprise prediction impossible. Leggett remains highly susceptible to volatility in raw material prices, particularly steel. In fact, this has been hurting the company’s top- and bottom-line performances in last few quarters. Further, margins remain under pressure, mainly due to steel costs inflation, which is likely to continue hurting margins in first-quarter 2018.Meanwhile, Leggett’s strategies to enhance business portfolio, disciplined capital allocation and progress on goals for 2019 look encouraging. Additionally, the company remains on track to achieve its top-third TSR target by 2020 through revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves. (Read: Will Steel Cost Inflation Hurt Leggett's Q1 Earnings?)Mohawk Industries, Inc.

Moreover, Mohawk surpassed expectations in all of the last four quarters, the average being 1.6%.Introduction of innovative products across its portfolio is expected to improve segment and boost overall sales, which will be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. The company has been launching higher value products, adding service centers and unique merchandise. The company’s capital expenditure rose to around $900 million in 2017.The company intends to invest additional $750 million in 2018. Mohawk is expected to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from the expansion of LVT in the United States and Europe; ceramic capacity increases in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and Russia; luxury laminate in the United States, Europe and Russia; carpet tile in Europe; sheet vinyl in Russia; countertops in the United States and Europe; and carpet and rugs in the United States.This apart, the company is likely to benefit from its strategy of driving growth through acquisitions, which will be evident in the to-be-reported quarter. Since the beginning of 2017, the company has made four acquisitions. The buyouts have enhanced the company’s product portfolio and expanded geographic footprint and market share. While these acquisitions have contributed to the company’s top line, Mohawk is also undertaking initiatives to improve the performance of the acquired companies. Such measures include the implementation of new strategies and transformation of organizational structures.However, increased raw material costs as well as start-up expenses behind new products and production continue to raise concerns.Taking all these factors into consideration, the company expects first-quarter EPS in the range of $2.93-$3.02 compared with $2.72 reported in the prior-year quarter. Also, earnings will benefit from a stronger euro and reduced global tax rate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.01, reflecting an increase of 10.7% year over year. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.41 billion, reflecting an increase of 8.7% year over year.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that Mohawk is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

267,MHK,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Mohawk Industries, Inc. (MHK  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Mohawk Industries has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.2. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Mohawk Industries’ current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 19.7) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Mohawk Industries has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Mohawk Industries’ stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Mohawk Industries has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Mohawk Industries currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes MHK a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Mohawk Industries is just 2.1, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, MHK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Mohawk Industries might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives MHK a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A.

Finally, the initial jobless claims hit a 45-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46. However, the S&P 500 fell 3.8% to close at 2,581. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 6,777.16, losing 3.9%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 14.5% to close at 31.76.A total of around 10.6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.2 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by an 8.26 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 5.58-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets in Correction, Major Stocks Pull BackThe Dow suffered severe losses after plummeting as much as 1,033 points on Thursday. This is the blue-chip index’s second decline by over 1,000 points during this week. Such a dip also led the Dow to finish 10.4% off its record close on Jan 26, 2018, charting its second-biggest decline in terms of points since its inception.Also, this marked its third decline by more than 500 points in a matter of five days. The blue-chip index finished at its lowest level since Nov 28, 2017 and is set to post its worst weekly decline since October 2008. Despite these losses, the Dow still managed to finish above its lowest close for the week of 23,778.74 that it hit on Tuesday.Losses for the Dow were broad based. Shares of American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined 5.6%, 5.4% and 4.4%, respectively, contributing majorly to the Dow’s losses.The S&P 500 bled 100.7 points to end in negative territory, finishing 10.2% off its all-time high.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Broader markets suffered huge losses on Thursday following concerns over increasing market volatility, a possible surge in inflation which might lead to a rate hike and an increase in bond yields. Analysts also stated that this correction was just a pullback from massive gains scored for the major part of 2017 and the first month of 2018. Market watchers also speculated a government shutdown would come about if the Senators do not pass the budget deal by midnight.CBOE VIX Rears its Ugly Head AgainHaving fallen for two consecutive sessions, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged almost 24% in intraday trade to 34.48. However, the fear gauge mellowed down to 14.5% by the end of the session. The index of market uncertainty has shown severe fluctuations over the week, highlighting the frenzy that market watchers have gone through over this period. Such panic has arisen primarily out of speculations regarding a hike in inflation even as the economy has been burgeoning.Possibility of Partial Federal ShutdownLeaders from Congress announced on Wednesday that they had agreed upon a two-year budget deal to end the uncertainty regarding government spending and immigration laws. Such tensions had led to a government shutdown earlier in the month. Agreement on the budget legislation came months after both Republicans and Democrats tried to reach a consensus on the deal.The deal seeks to increase federal spending by $300 billion over the next two years. This would exceed the ceiling that was imposed by in 2011. The deal increases military spending by $80 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year through September and further by $85 billion in fiscal 2019. This comes over and above the emerging war funds of about $140 billion.The new agreement also seeks to extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program by 10 years and spare another $80 billion for disaster relief funding. Moreover, the legislation also beefs up non-defense spending by $63 billion for this year and by $68 billion for 2019.The future of the deal is uncertain as it requires the support from the Democrats, who are expected to out rightly oppose any surge in government spending. Further, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants a vote in favor of the protection of undocumented immigrants termed as ‘Dreamers’, in return for voting in favor of the budget spending. This issue has gone unaddressed in the $300 billion deal. Finally, if the deal is not passed by the midnight, the U.S. is headed for another partial federal shutdown.Jobless Claims near a 45-Year LowInitial jobless claims for the last week came in at 221,000 as opposed to 230,000 for the previous period. The consensus estimate for the current period was 233,000. The monthly average of the jobless claims plummeted 10,000 to 224,500 on Thursday. This marks its lowest level since March 1973.Stocks That Made HeadlinesViacom Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Decrease Y/YViacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017), wherein earnings per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

272,MHK,"Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s (MHK  -  Free Report) launch of innovative products and synergies from acquisitions are encouraging. However, a highly competitive flooring industry and negative currency translations continue to dent profits.Key Growth DriversBeing one of the largest flooring manufacturers in the global market, Mohawk holds a dominant position in the highly fragmented and competitive industry. Moreover, in order to enter new markets and enhance capacity, the company is continuously making internal investments. In fact, for 2017, the company plans to invest approximately $900 million to optimize long-term results by entering new product categories and expanding its market.The company expects its combined capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017 to contribute about 1.4 billion to new capacity. By introducing differentiated products, the company expects productivity to improve in 2017 as compared to 2016.Moreover, acquisitions form an integral part of Mohawk’s growth strategy. These buyouts have enhanced the company’s product portfolio and expanded its geographic footprint and market share. Since the beginning of 2017, the company has made four acquisitions. It has entered the European carpet tile and countertop market as well as the Russian sheet vinyl business. In April, Mohawk completed the acquisition of two small ceramic manufacturers in Europe and a carpet nylon polymerization plant in the United States.Also, with the recovery in the housing market on historically low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, Mohawk is expected to grow on higher revenues.Meanwhile, the company’s pricing actions have successfully mitigated the effects of overall inflation and rising material costs in third-quarter 2017.

The company’s pricing strategies and improved productivity have helped the company drive earnings.In fact, over the past 60 days, earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have increased 0.9% and 0.2%, respectively, reflecting analysts’ optimism over the stock’s prospects.ConcernsGiven Mohawk’s strong international presence, with higher net sales being generated outside the United States, the company is exposed to negative currency translation effects.Notably, shares of Mohawk have gained as much as its industry’s on a year-to-date basis. The company’s stock has gained 38% compared with the industry’s 38.1%.Nevertheless, by virtue of its industry-leading designs, patented technologies and brands, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is slated for future growth.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector are Deckers Outdoor Corp.

This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Mohawkhas a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Mohawk’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Mohawk has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Mohawk stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Mohawk has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MHK is roughly in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Mohawk currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Mohawk a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Mohawk might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F. This gives MHK a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat. The current quarter has seen eight estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upper, while the full year estimate has seen nine down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 3.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined by 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus  Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus | Mohawk Industries, Inc. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMohawk is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 25% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

However, the bottom line grew 11% year over year on higher sales and improved productivity.Total revenues of $2.41 billion came in line with the consensus mark but increased 9% year over year on higher sales across all segments. The positives were somewhat offset by the adverse impact of higher-than-expected material and freight costs.The company’s first-quarter 2018 results benefited from its diverse geographical footprint and product portfolio. Mohawk registered solid growth in LVT in its largest markets. The company’s top and bottom lines witnessed robust growth in ceramic business outside the United States.Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit of $753.6 million increased 5.4% year over year.

In the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income and margin is expected to be more than the level in 2017, as the impact from start-ups and patents decline.Meanwhile, the company anticipates 2018 operating income to be adversely impacted by $30-35 million from higher start-up costs and $40 million from patents that expired in 2017. In total, the company’s operating income will be reduced by $70-75 million.

278,MHK,"The Consumer Discretionary sector, which covers major home furnishing companies, is likely to see a 1.7% drop in earnings this quarter compared to 4.7% growth last quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 2.9%, lower than last quarter’s 8.8%.This sector, which is ranked among the bottom 38% (10 out of 16) of all Zacks sectors, has been facing challenges like volatile commodity prices, changing consumer spending patterns and adverse currency fluctuations. Nevertheless, rising consumer confidence on the back of a steady housing sector is a major positive.Notably, home furnishing companies like Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) and Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc’s (LL  -  Free Report) have seen a rally in their shares post the hurricane mayhem. As home owners have faced damaged properties, rebuilding efforts have ramped up. This in turn has driven demand for home-improvement equipment and materials.However, the hurricanes might adversely affect results of such companies in the third quarter owing to disruptions in demand and supply chains. Nevertheless, increased demand of home improvement products will largely benefit these companies.All said, let’s see what awaits the following stocks that are queued up for third-quarter 2017 earnings release on Oct 26.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is exposed to substantial volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and the market for the same being cyclical in nature. Incidentally, the company’s bottom line has declined year over year for three straight quarters now, owing to inflation in raw material price. In the last quarter, earnings and EBIT fell 3% and 7.4% year over year, respectively, due to higher steel price.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents, which represents an 8.1% decline from the year-ago figure. Earnings estimates have been stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,010 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Leggett this quarter.

(TILE  -  Free Report), The Dixie Group, Inc. (DXYN  -  Free Report) and Crown Crafts, Inc. (CRWS  -  Free Report), courtesy of its industry-leading designs, patented technologies and brands.Strong on Acquisitions & InnovationAn opportunistic approach to acquisitions is an important part of Mohawk Industries’ growth strategy. These acquisitions have enhanced the company’s product portfolio and expanded its geographic footprint and market share. Since the beginning of 2017, the company has made four acquisitions. It has entered the European carpet tile and countertop market as well as the Russian sheet vinyl business. In April, Mohawk Industries completed the acquisition of two small ceramic manufacturers in Europe and a carpet nylon polymerization plant in the United States.We are also encouraged by Mohawk Industries’ increased investments in product innovation, productivity and distribution. The company is introducing higher value products, adding service centers and unique merchandise in promotions to optimize each channel.The company intends to invest more than $850 million in 2017 on product innovation, enhanced automation and driving synergies from the four acquisitions made so far this year.Although July and August housing data has been weak, the overall fundamentals of the housing market are strong. A recovering economy, historically low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point to strong demand.As Mohawk Industries has heavy exposure to the U.S. residential sector, its revenues are expected to increase with improvement in consumer spending patterns and higher demand for flooring in both commercial and residential markets.However, the impact of currency headwinds still remains significant. Mohawk Industries generates almost one-third of its revenues from customers outside the United States. Currency headwinds hurt sales in 2016 by $69 million. Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Mohawk Industries will incur higher startup costs owing to increased production and marketing activities.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

282,MHK,"The earnings reporting cycle is moving ahead in full steam, with numerous companies posting their quarterly numbers this week. Per the Earnings Preview dated Jul 25, 36.1% of the S&P 500 members have reported results. While results announced so far showcases year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines, the pace of the same has decelerated sequentially. Nevertheless, the fraction of companies that have topped earnings and revenue estimates have increased from the last quarter.  Coming to numbers, we note that out of the 128 S&P 500 companies that have reported their quarterly numbers, approximately 77.3% posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.3% beat top-line expectations. Further, earnings for these companies that have reported so far have advanced 7% from the same period last year, while revenues have jumped 4.2%.Further, as per the Earnings Trends dated Jul 21, earnings for the total S&P 500 companies are projected to improve 8.6% from the year-ago period with total revenue climbing 1.2%. As of now, the overall picture looks favorable for this reporting season.A Look at the Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which five are expected to witness an earnings decline in the second quarter, with Autos being major drag. The Consumer Discretionary sector, which also houses major home furnishing stocks, is poised to suffer a 1.5% drop in earnings this quarter, while revenues are expected to rise a notable 7.8%.This sector, which is ranked among the Bottom 44% of all Zacks sectors, has been reeling under several challenges like volatile commodity prices, ever changing consumer spending patterns and adverse currency fluctuations. Nevertheless, rising consumer confidence, on the back of an improving labor market and housing segment recovery, gives out positive signals. Driven by such factors, the sector has grown 13.6% so far this year, surpassing the S&P 500 market’s jump of 10.6%.All said, let’s see what awaits the following Home – Furnishing stocks that are queued up for second-quarter 2017 earnings releases on Jul 27.Can LEG & MHK Spring a Surprise?Manufacturer of engineered products – Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  The company is unlikely to beat earnings because it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Leggett is working toward achieving its top-line growth target of 4–5% annually. In 2017, management expects strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, and Geo Components businesses. This in turn is expected to boost volume and driving sales. Further, management expects sales growth to fuel earnings in 2017, which makes us hopeful of the quarter to be reported. However, Leggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices. Evidently, Leggett’s bottom line was hurt by steel price inflation in the first quarter and persistence of inflationary pressure remains a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017. (Read more: Will Volatile Steel Prices Hit Leggett's Q2 Earnings?)Moving to Mohawk Industries, Inc. (MHK  -  Free Report), this global manufacturer of flooring products’ Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult, though its solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) bodes well. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mohawk is likely to benefit from its strategy of achieving growth via acquisitions. The company’s EPS guidance for the second quarter (including acquisitions) represents a 1.7% to 4.3% increase year over year. Moreover, Mohawk Industries is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario, as it has heavy exposure to the U.S. residential sector. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, affordable interest/mortgage rates, rapidly increasing household formation hint at strong demand in 2017. However, we are apprehensive about the persistent pressure from adverse foreign currency movement, since Mohawk Industries generates a significant amount of its revenues from outside the U.S.  Also, the company expects high raw materials cost to outweigh pricing in the second quarter, which remains a concern.

283,MHK,"Mohawk Industries, Inc. (MHK  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.4%. Meanwhile, it reported positive earnings surprises in all of the past four quarters, the average being 1.51%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAcquisitions are an important part of Mohawk Industries’ growth strategy which helps broaden its product portfolio and expand its geographic footprint and market share. The company had plans to finalize four acquisitions in the second quarter in order to expand its product offerings, geographic penetration and competitive position. The EPS guidance for the second quarter is at $3.53 to $3.62 (including acquisitions), which represents a 1.7% to 4.3% increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.61, reflecting a 3.9% year-over-year increase.Apart from its inorganic drive, Mohawk Industries is introducing distinctive collections to boost sales. It is aggressively implementing productivity improvements and bringing new capacity online to support sales growth. Notably, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $2.46 billion, implying a 6.6% increase.Moreover, Mohawk Industries is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario, as it has heavy exposure to the U.S. residential sector. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, affordable interest/mortgage rates and rapidly increasing household formation hint at strong demand in 2017.However, we are apprehensive about the persistent pressure from adverse foreign currency movement, since Mohawk Industries generates a significant amount of its revenues from outside the U.S.Also, the rise in raw material costs has led Mohawk Industries to raise prices across its business, including a second increase for carpets (effective late May 2017), an increase for Ceramic (effective by the end of the second quarter), and a series of increases across Europe. The company expects raw materials cost to outweigh pricing in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mohawk Industries will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $3.61. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteZacks Rank: Mohawk Industries carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Consumer Discretionary sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +31.25% and a Zacks Rank #3. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

284,MHK,"The pain from the 60 Minutes expose on Lumber Liquidators (LL  -  Free Report) isn't over yet. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) recently declined to provide full year guidance as sales continued to sink in the second quarter.

"
286,MHK,"It turns out the damage to Lumber Liquidators' business from the 60 Minutes report making unfavorable allegations about the company's Chinese manufactured laminate floors wasn't confined to just one quarter.
"
287,MHK,"The 60 Minutes report aired in March and, not surprising, March sales fell 12.8% compared to March 2014.
"
288,MHK,"But the problem is that they haven't really recovered.
"
289,MHK,"On Aug 5, Lumber Lidquidators reported its second quarter results and sales fell 5.8% year over year.
"
290,MHK,"Comparable store net sales declined 10% due to a 7.6% decrease in the number of customers invoiced and a 2.4% decrease in the average sale.
"
291,MHK,"The company instituted aggressive promotional practices in the quarter to try and woo customers back, which it believes was partially successful. No Full Year Guidance
"
292,MHK,"But given that sales aren't bouncing back as quickly as once thought, Lumber Liquidators decided to simply not provide full year guidance. 
"
293,MHK,"What it WOULD confirm is that it would open a total of 20 to 25 new store locations in the expanded showroom format in the year and that it was remodeling 10 to 15 existing stores in the expanded showroom format.
"
294,MHK,"But it wouldn't provide EPS or sales guidance.Analysts Slash Estimates Again
"
295,MHK,"The analysts know things are bad. The company missed big on the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter, posting a loss of $0.75 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $0.07.

"
302,MHK,"Lumber Liquidators no longer has a forward P/E because it's supposed to see a loss in 2015. 
"
303,MHK,"But even looking forward to 2016 and it's $0.29 earnings, that would give the stock a forward P/E of 48 at the current share price around $14. 
"
304,MHK,"That's certainly not anywhere close to cheap.
"
305,MHK,"The company is also tackling its issues with an Acting CEO. Thomas Sullivan, the original founder, is filling in due to the May resignation of former CEO Robert Lynch.

Before you get mad and throw the Oxy wipes at me, these are the stocks you look for every week. These are the gems that bring home the bacon. This, my friends, is your weekly list of runaway breakout stocks with monumental momentum. These stocks are runaway freight trains that cannot be stopped and hopefully, won’t stop out before hitting your profit target.As always I start with the Zacks Rank. It’s that Zacks Rank methodology that’s led to an average annual return of 26% since 1988. That’s before my sister was born and she’s about to get married in November. In that time I’ve seen the Bears disappoint me twenty five out of twenty six years. We’ve had two great bull markets and two really rough bear markets in between. Yet still, Zacks comes out on top.I take those Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks and add in a little bit of my own momentum stock magic. How about getting a Momentum Style Score of “A” or “B” on top of that? Now for the finish, stocks that are breaking out to fresh 52-week highs. This way we are buying strong stock earnings stories that have price momentum at a time that the market likes them the most. Sounds like a winning combination to me. That’s why I keep bringing these awesome stocks to your attention on a weekly basis.Click FOLLOW THE AUTHOR above for weekly breakout picks! Twitter @bartosiasticsAlon USA Energy (ALJ)Alon USA Energy, Inc. is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating primarily in the Southwestern and South Central regions of the United States.Shares of ALJ have been on a rampage all year. At first that should seem a bit surprising given the price of oil during 2015. But if you take a closer look you’ll notice this is not an E&P play, this is a refiner. That means they can make money as long as the “crack spread” or the different between West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude is favorable. Good news for this stock, it is. Shares have burst through $20 and look like there is no holding them back.Click FOLLOW THE AUTHOR above for weekly breakout picks!

From there, an oversold commodity channel index turned bullish, crossing above the zero line and setting off the rebound.

The company designs, manufactures and markets carpet and rugs in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns. I know that textiles companies haven’t been high tech since the Industrial Revolution but that doesn’t mean they can’t be considered momentum stocks. Especially when they’ve put the moves on like Mohawk has over the last year. In October 2014 this was an $120 stock and now it sits above $200. A slow and steady pace to this one, rarely pushing the commodity channel index over 200 but also rarely dipping below the 21-day. It just bounced at support there a few days ago at $197.

310,MHK,"Interface, Inc. (TILE  -  Free Report) got hit by the double whammy of bad weather in the United States and the slowdown in Asia in the first quarter. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 53%.
"
311,MHK,"Interface is the largest producer of modular carpet in the world. It sells under the Interface and FLOR brands to both commercial and residential buyers.Weather and Asia...Oh My
"
312,MHK,"On Apr 23, Interface reported its first quarter results and missed the Zacks Consensus by 7 cents. Earnings were $0.06 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $0.13. 
"
313,MHK,"Sales rose 4.1% to $219 million from $210.4 million a year ago but this was under the consensus. 
"
314,MHK,"Even though the company blamed poor weather for decreasing store traffic and lowering consumer sentiment in January and February, FLOR sales still rose 6% year over year. Overall, in the Americas, business held up and improved into March.
"
315,MHK,"Europe also showed continued improvement, with first quarter sales up 15%. They also accelerated into April which is a good sign for the second quarter if that momentum continues.
"
316,MHK,"But Asia-Pacific was hammered, with sales falling 17%. Interface blamed it on a drop in business in Australia as a result of longer lead times and service issues following its 2012 plant fire in Australia. The Chinese New Year holiday also had negative impacts on the quarter. 
"
317,MHK,"But April in Asia-Pacific was also supposedly tracking softly again. Estimates Cut for 2014
"
318,MHK,"It's not surprising that with the earnings miss in the first quarter that the analysts cut full year estimates. 6 estimates have been cut in the last 30 days pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $0.85 from $0.93.
"
319,MHK,"All is not doom and gloom, however, as that's still 26% earnings growth in 2014.

"
325,MHK,"Retailers procure goods in large quantities directly from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them in smaller quantities to customers through 
"
326,MHK,"retail shops or online platforms. As consumer spending is the key to the viability of any economy, the health of the retail industry becomes an important economic indicator.
"
327,MHK,"As a leader in the retail business, the United States provides ample growth opportunities for all types of retail companies. The retail industry covers everything in its scope, ranging from internet catalog sales, auto dealers, convenience stores, vending machines and clothing -- thus dividing retailers into numerous categories. Retailers of all sizes, including individual direct marketers or direct sellers, small- to medium-sized franchise unit owners, and large “big-box” store operators compete in the U.S.
"
328,MHK,"From a growth perspective, the retail industry is among the dominant U.S. industries, and employs an enormous workforce. Retail sales represent approximately 30% of consumer spending.Correlation with the Economy
"
329,MHK,"So far this year, the broader markets have showcased signs of a better pace of recovery and have thus infused hopes of a better economic 
"
330,MHK,"scenario going forward. One could contest this economic outlook, but the stock market’s strong recent gains show clearly which way investors think the economy is headed. After strong gains this year, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are in record territory already and on the cusp of reaching milestone levels.
"
331,MHK,"The stock market continues to soar given the Federal Reserve's stimulus program, wherein the central bank buys $85 million in bonds each month. Though the Fed Officials hinted to gradually roll back the program, however, the timing of the probable tapering of the program is still not certain.
"
332,MHK,"Overall, most market participants expect the Fed to hold off on making any changes to its policy stance at least through April 2014.
"
333,MHK,"An improved housing backdrop and gains on the labor market front have raised hopes of better times to come on consumer spending front. The recent rise in mortgage rates as a result of Fed taper fears has had some dampening effect on the housing sector, but overall activity level in the sector remains favorable. The last jobs report also indicated positive momentum in the labor market, though the data may not have been entirely reliable given effects from government shutdown.
"
334,MHK,"However, consumer confidence appears to have taken a hit as a result of the fiscal discord in Washington DC.
"
335,MHK,"The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell drastically to 71.2 in Oct 2013 following a small dip to 80.2 in September. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey shows similar weakness.Key Metrics
"
336,MHK,"The key data in retail industry analysis is comparable-store sales (comps), as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores. An improving job market, lower gas prices and favorable weather boosted sales data.
"
337,MHK,"Apart from this, the reopening of government offices boosted customer traffic to stores for buy-now and wear-now apparel. These positives aided retailers to generate healthy sales for the month of October with consumer spending gaining some pace. As a result, the key metric data for most retailers reflected growth for the month of October.
"
338,MHK,"Among the retailers, clothing chain L Brands Inc. (LTD), a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care
"
339,MHK,"products, led the pack with an 8% rise comparable-store sales and an 11.4% increase in net sales. This was followed by drugstore operator Walgreen Co. (WAG), which posted a 5.8% rise in comps and a 6.1% increase in total sales.
"
340,MHK,"Off-price retailer of apparels, footwear and accessories Stein Mart Inc.  was also on the list of best performers. The company registered a
"
341,MHK,"5.4% rise in October comps, while total sales increased 6.9%. The Gap Inc. (GPS) posted a 4% rise in comps and a 5.7% increase in net sales to $1.29 billion for the month of October.
"
342,MHK,"Apparel and accessories retailer, Cato Corporation (CATO) reported a 3% rise in comps with a 4% improvement in net sales. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), the warehouse retailer, also delivered comps growth of 3%. Meanwhile, net sales for October rose 6% to $8.15 billion from $7.66 billion in the year-ago period.The Buckle Inc. (BKE), a retailer of casual apparels, footwear and accessories for men and women, witnessed a 2.6% rise in comps when compared with Oct 2012 results. Net sales increased 2.8% to $86.6 million from $84.2 million in the prior-year period.
"
343,MHK,"Drugstore chain retailer Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) reported a 2.1% growth in comparable-store sales for Oct 2013, primarily driven by improved comps results at its pharmacy stores. Total drugstore sales climbed 2.2% to $1.961 billion for the month.
"
344,MHK,"However, some retailers showcased soft performance. Washington-based retailer of sports-related teen apparel Zumiez Inc.  reported a 1.2% increase in comps, while net sales notched 10% higher to $46.3 million. Discount store operator Fred's, Inc. (FRED) witnessed marginal growth with only a 0.8% rise in comps, up from a 0.8% decrease witnessed in Oct 2012. Net sales for October increased 2% to $143.4 million.
"
345,MHK,"However, the U.S. retail and food services sales data for Sep 2013 were disappointing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the retail and food services sales fell 1% sequentially but improved 3.2% year-over-year to $425.9 billion.Retailing - New Game, New Rules
"
346,MHK,"The retail industry is rapidly evolving with a dramatic change in consumer buying habits. Satisfying customers and enriching buying experience require new strategies from retailers today. Modern retailing, interestingly enough, is a new game with new rules.
"
347,MHK,"Despite the gradual rise in consumer discretionary purchases, the sluggish U.S. economy and continued weak in Europe cannot be ignored. Burdened with the lackluster scenario, retailers have largely concentrated on buyers’ needs and lured them with innovative products, attractive discounts, free shipping and the ease of shopping through smartphones and tablets. However, these strategies only helped in generating modest revenues.
"
348,MHK,"Thus, retailers essentially need to come up with brilliant strategies, while incorporating technological advancements and utilizing their real estate portfolio to the optimum level. In short, they need to Experiment, Differentiate, Optimize and Transform. In doing so, most retailers today are adopting an “omnichannel” approach, utilizing all possible mediums to engage consumers, including brick and mortar stores, online, and mobile.
"
349,MHK,"Banking on this new mantra, Staples Inc. (SPLS), the world’s largest retailer of office products and services and second largest online retailer, launched its first omnichannel stores, what it refers to as ""the future of retail.""
"
350,MHK,"Simply put, through this omnichannel strategy, Staples hopes to integrate its retail network with enhanced digital capabilities. The company stated that stores will incorporate its .com and mobile assets. Alongside, the stores will feature Staples.com kiosks.
"
351,MHK,"This new era store concept, with all its attractions could well prove to be a game changer in the long run for Staples. Providing shoppers the ease of shopping on their own terms and enriching their in-store shopping experience could be a crucial point of differentiation among other retailers.
"
352,MHK,"In harmony with the evolving retail industry, department store operator Macy's Inc. (M) also adopted an omnichannel strategy. Despite macroeconomic challenges and cautious consumer spending, Macy’s continues to post healthy results. Management largely attributes the credit to its omnichannel strategy aimed at enhancing customers’ shopping experience.
"
353,MHK,"Other notable retailers who are dancing to the tune of the omnichannel strategy include Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Chico’s FAS Inc. (CHS).Trends to Rule Going Forward
"
354,MHK,"Some of the trends that are expected to rule the retail sector going forward include employing more technological solutions, incorporating customer feedback and targeting additional audiences with products and services.
"
355,MHK,"With the growth of the .com era, shoppers have largely adopted new purchasing modes, using the Internet, mobile phones and tablets. Consumers today prefer to use their laptops or smartphones to compare prices of products they want to buy and place orders online, instead of visiting the company’s stores. This growing trend has guided major U.S. retail chains to downsize their physical retail operations, and in turn develop their e-Commerce and m-Commerce sites to attract customers.
"
356,MHK,"Other traits that are expected to affect the retail industry are the growth of self-service options for processes such as checking out and finding items in stores. These offerings provide greater convenience and faster transactions, and they satisfy shoppers who prefer to visit brick-and-mortar locations for immediately purchasing predetermined items.
"
357,MHK,"Of late, the store-within-a-store concept has been making headlines, though it's nothing new to retailers. J. C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP) is one such retailer which has been focusing on this business strategy for quite some time. The recent one to join the league is consumer electronic retailer Best Buy Company Inc. (BBY), which has been facing stiff competition from industry bellwethers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to increase its footfall, sales and profitability.
"
358,MHK,"Best Buy is leaving no stone unturned to woo consumers and attain incremental revenue, and it was well evident from its strategic initiative of opening over 1,400 ""Samsung Experience Shops"" within its stores, announced in April. The model seems to be working for the retailer, which also has a dedicated floor area for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) products.
"
359,MHK,"Taking the initiatives further, Best Buy recently unveiled its partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to roll out the “Windows Store” across its 500 outlets in the U.S. with an additional 100 in Canada. The electronics retailer come out with better-than-expected results for the October quarter, but warned about trends in its margins for the all-important holiday season quarter.
"
360,MHK,"Further, retailers across the industry are identifying the need to know their customers better, to drive growth. In today’s retail world, where consumer is the king, companies are focusing on effectively using data and analytics to better understand consumers, as well as for branding, product management, and making better pricing decisions. Focused on leveraging large amounts of consumer-related data and providing personalized solutions to customers, retailers are adopting the technologies like Cloud Computing.Challenges and Some Remedial Measures
"
361,MHK,"The retail industry is highly competitive and encounters significant challenges. Although the U.S. economy has started witnessing a recovery, we still believe that 2013 will not fully mark the resurrection. Consumers are slowly regaining confidence and cautiously increasing their spending.
"
362,MHK,"Moreover, consumers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increase in fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels, and high household debt levels, which may negatively impact their discretionary spending and eventually adversely affect the growth and profitability of retail companies.Macroeconomic Conditions: Retail is no different from other U.S. industries, which is highly dependent on the economy to prosper. Such heightened dependence on the economy and factors like job growth and interest rates indicate that a speedy recovery of the economy is vital for the health of the retail industry. While the unemployment rate has decreased considerably over time, consumers are now beginning to draw out their savings to spend, anticipating some economic recovery.Changes in Consumer Needs, Attitudes and Behavior: The growth of modern retail is linked to consumer needs, attitudes and behavior. Adapting to the sluggish economic environment prevalent over the last few years, consumer behavior has shifted to being more conservative. This has now become the regular behavioral pattern of consumers as they remain budget conscious, seeking greater value. In the process, buyers are swiftly switching to the less expensive brands and consolidating shopping trips.
"
363,MHK,"Moreover, people today prefer to cook at home instead of eat out. This shift in consumer behavior is inducing retailers to adopt various strategies to stay in the competition. Retailers are offering trend-right and well-designed assortments at compelling prices, without compromising on the quality, in order to drive traffic.Staging Stores: The waning popularity of brick-and-mortar store formats has made it essential for retailers to adopt new techniques like ‘staging stores’ to woo customers. Staging basically refers to the act of making the company’s stores attractive, where people like to spend their time. The idea behind this strategy is to make shopping interesting for consumers, so that they would want to walk into the stores, rather than shop online.Zacks Industry Rank

"
369,MHK,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector portrays an impressive earnings trend. The third quarter 2013 results for the sector were disappointing in terms of both beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and growth.
"
370,MHK,"The earnings ""beat ratio"" was 52%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was 28%. Total earnings for this sector increased 6.2% year over year, reflecting an improvement over 7.3% growth registered in the second quarter of 2013.

371,MHK,"Looking at the consensus earnings expectations for the rest of the year, the picture looks blurred with earnings expected to grow only 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013, registering full-year 2013 growth of 7.2%.

"
379,MHK,"Retailers procure goods in large quantities directly from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them in smaller quantities to customers through retail shops or online platforms. As consumer spending is the key to the viability of any economy, the health of the retail industry becomes an important economic indicator.
"
380,MHK,"As a leader in the retail business, the United States provides ample growth opportunities for all types of retail companies. The retail industry covers everything in its scope, ranging from internet catalog sales, auto dealers, convenience stores, vending machines and clothing; thus dividing retailers into numerous categories. Retailers of all sizes, including individual direct marketers or direct sellers, small- to medium-sized franchise unit owners, and large “big-box” store operators compete in the U.S.
"
381,MHK,"From a growth perspective, the retail industry is among the dominant U.S. industries, and employs an enormous workforce.Correlation with the Economy
"
382,MHK,"So far this year, the broader markets have showcased signs of a better pace of recovery and have thus infused hopes of a better economic scenario in the second half of the year and beyond. One could contest this economic outlook, but the stock market’s strong recent gains show clearly which way investors think the economy is headed. The S&P 500 index has clocked gains of roughly 14.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained approximately 15.2% so far this year.
"
383,MHK,"The belief in economic recovery is reflected in measures of consumer confidence hitting new multi-year high. The recent Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index improved to 81.4 in Jun 2013 from a revised 74.3 in May 2013. The index notched its highest level since Jan 2008, when it had touched 87.3. This prompts a sense of optimism about steady increase in consumer spending going forward.
"
384,MHK,"The recovery in the housing market, stock prices gaining momentum and improving labor market conditions played vital roles to help the consumer confidence move north.
"
385,MHK,"According to the Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development, sales of new houses jumped 2.1% sequentially in May 2013 and surged 29% from May 2012. Additionally, unemployment rate is currently hovering around 7.6%, reflecting an improvement from 7.9% in the beginning of the year.
"
386,MHK,"Meanwhile, Fed Officials hinted that it might gradually roll back the $85 billion monthly stimulus program in the later part of the year and said that they might discontinue the program by the middle of next year if economy improves further.
"
387,MHK,"Fed Officials look quite optimistic about the unemployment rate going down to a range of 7.2% to 7.3% in 2013 with expected economic growth of 2.3% to 2.6%. Moreover, they see the unemployment rate between 6.5% and 6.8% next year, driven by economic growth in the 3% to 3.5% range.
"
388,MHK,"We will have to wait and see how the economic picture unfolds, but Ben Bernanke in his Congressional testimony this week indicated that the Fed will maintain accommodative monetary policy for a very long time even if they make changes to the QE program.Key Metric for June
"
389,MHK,"The key data in retail industry analysis is comparable-store sales (comps), as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores. Improving job market, lower gas prices, warmer weather and clearance discounts boosted consumer sentiment. These positives aided retailers to generate healthy sales for the month of June with consumer spending gaining some pace.
"
390,MHK,"Among the retailers, clothing chain The Gap Inc. (GPS) led the pack with a 7% rise in comps and an 8% increase in net sales to $1.53 billion for the month of June. Off-price retailer of apparels, footwear and accessories Stein Mart Inc.  was also on the list of best performers. The company registered a 6.5% rise in June comps, while total sales increased 2.6% to $109 million.  
"
391,MHK,"Furthermore, discount store operator Fred's, Inc. (FRED) witnessed a significant improvement with a 4.5% rise in comps, substantially up from the 4% decrease witnessed in Jun 2012. Net sales for June increased 3% to $187.7 million. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), the warehouse retailer, delivered comparable-store sales growth of 6% in June, following an increase of 5% in May. Meanwhile, net sales for June rose 8% to $9.92 billion from $9.16 billion in the year-ago period.The Buckle, Inc. (BKE), a retailer of casual apparels, footwear and accessories for men and women, witnessed a 3.4% rise in comps when compared with Jun 2012 results. Net sales increased 3.9% to $82.5 million from $79.4 million in the prior-year period.
"
392,MHK,"However, some retailers showcased soft performance. Apparel and accessories retailer, Cato Corporation (CATO) reported a 1% rise in comps. L Brands, Inc. (LTD), a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products posted flat comparable-store sales. Washington-based retailer of sports-related teen apparel Zumiez Inc.  reported a 1.0% increase in comps.
"
393,MHK,"Drugstore chain retailer Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) reported marginal growth in comparable-store sales for Jun 2013, thereby breaking the declining trend of comps for the past four months. The company’s comps for the 4-week period ended Jun 29, 2013 inched up 0.7%, primarily driven by improved comps results at its pharmacy and front-end stores.
"
394,MHK,"However, the U.S. retail and food services sales data for Jun 2013 were somewhat disappointing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the retail and food services sales grew 0.4% sequentially and 5.7% year-over-year to $422.8 billion. The rate of increase decelerated from 0.5% gain in May 2013 and fell short of analysts’ expectation of 0.7% to 0.9% increase. Retail sales represent approximately 30% of consumer spending.Retailing - New Game, New Rules
"
395,MHK,"The retail industry is rapidly evolving with a dramatic change in consumer buying habits. Satisfying customers and enriching buying experience require new strategies from retailers today. Modern retailing, interestingly enough, is a new game with new rules.
"
396,MHK,"Despite the gradual rise in consumer discretionary purchases, the sluggish U.S. economy and recessionary fears in Europe cannot be ignored. Burdened with the lackluster scenario, retailers have largely concentrated on buyers’ needs and lured them with innovative products, attractive discounts, free shipping and the ease of shopping through smartphones and tablets. However, these strategies only helped in generating modest revenues.
"
397,MHK,"Thus, retailers essentially need to ideate brilliant strategies, while incorporating technological advancements and utilizing their real estate portfolio to the optimum level. In short, they need to Experiment, Differentiate, Optimize and Transform.
"
398,MHK,"Banking on this new mantra, Staples Inc. (SPLS), the world’s largest retailer of office products and services and second largest online retailer, launched its first omnichannel stores – what it refers to as the future of retail.
"
399,MHK,"Simply put, through this omnichannel strategy, Staples hopes to integrate its retail network with enhanced digital capabilities. The company stated that stores will incorporate its .com and mobile assets. Alongside, the stores will feature Staples.com kiosks.  
"
400,MHK,"This new era store concept, with all its attractions could well prove to be a game changer in the long run for Staples. Providing shoppers the ease of shopping on their own terms and enriching their in-store shopping experience could be a crucial point of differentiation among other retailers.
"
401,MHK,"In harmony with the evolving retail industry, department store operator Macy's, Inc. (M) also adopted an omnichannel strategy. Despite macroeconomic challenges and cautious consumer spending, Macy’s continues to post healthy results. Management largely attributes the credit to its omnichannel strategy aimed at enhancing customers’ shopping experience.Trends to Rule 2013
"
402,MHK,"Some of the trends that are expected to rule the retail sector this year include employing more technological solutions, incorporating customer feedback and targeting additional audiences with products and services.
"
403,MHK,"With the growth of the .com era, shoppers have largely adopted new purchasing modes, using the Internet, mobile phones and tablets. Consumers today prefer to use their laptops or smartphones to compare prices of products they want to buy and place orders online, instead of visiting the company’s stores. This growing trend has guided major U.S. retail chains to downsize their physical retail operations, and in turn develop their e-Commerce and m-Commerce sites to attract customers.
"
404,MHK,"Other traits that are expected to affect the retail industry are the growth of self-service options for processes such as checking out and finding items in stores. These offerings provide greater convenience and faster transactions, and they satisfy shoppers who prefer to visit brick-and-mortar locations for immediately purchasing predetermined items.
"
405,MHK,"Of late, store-within-a store has been making headlines, though the concept is nothing new to retailers. J. C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP) is one such retailer which has been focusing on this business strategy for quite some time. The recent one to join the league is consumer electronic retailer Best Buy Company Inc. (BBY), which has been facing stiff competition from industry bellwethers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to increase its footfall, sales and profitability.
"
406,MHK,"Best Buy is leaving no stone unturned to woo consumers and attain incremental revenue, and it was well evident from its strategic initiative of opening over 1,400 ""Samsung Experience Shops"" within its stores, announced in April. The model seems to be working for the retailer, which also has a dedicated floor area for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) products. Taking the initiatives further, Best Buy recently unveiled its partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to roll out “Windows Store” across its 500 outlets in the U.S. with an additional 100 in Canada.Challenges and Some Remedial Measures
"
407,MHK,"The retail industry is highly competitive and encounters significant challenges. Although the U.S. economy has started witnessing a recovery, we still believe that 2013 will not fully mark the resurrection. Consumers are slowly regaining confidence and cautiously increasing their spending.
"
408,MHK,"Moreover, consumers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increase in fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels, and high household debt levels, which may negatively impact their discretionary spending and eventually adversely affect the growth and profitability of retail companies.Macroeconomic Conditions: Retail is no different from other U.S. industries, which is highly dependent on the economy to prosper. Such heightened dependence on the economy and factors like job growth and interest rates indicate that a speedy recovery of the economy is vital for the health of the retail industry. While the unemployment rate has decreased considerably over time, consumers are now beginning to draw out their savings to spend, anticipating some economic recovery.Changes in Consumer Needs, Attitudes and Behavior: The growth of modern retail is linked to consumer needs, attitudes and behavior. Adapting to the sluggish economic environment prevalent over the last few years, consumer behavior has shifted to being more conservative. This has now become the regular behavioral pattern of consumers as they remain budget conscious, seeking greater value. In the process, buyers are swiftly switching to the less expensive brands and consolidating shopping trips.
"
409,MHK,"Moreover, people today prefer to cook at home instead of eat out. This shift in consumer behavior is inducing retailers to adopt various strategies to stay in the competition. Retailers are offering trend-right and well-designed assortments at compelling prices, without compromising on the quality, in order to drive traffic.Staging Stores: The waning popularity of brick-and-mortar store formats has made it essential for retailers to adopt new techniques like ‘staging stores’ to woo customers. Staging basically refers to the act of making the company’s stores attractive, where people like to spend their time. The idea behind this strategy is to make shopping interesting for consumers, so that they would want to walk into the stores, rather than shop online.
