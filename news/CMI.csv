34,CMI,"General Electric (GE) reached a deal to lop off another chunk of its sprawling business on its last day as a component of the Dow Jones industrial average.XThe industrial conglomerate will sell its industrial gas engines unit for $3.25 billion to private equity firm Advent International, which reportedly edged out Cummins (CMI) to land the attractive business worth more than $1 billion in annual revenue.The distributed power unit, whose sale GE announced Monday, makes Jenbacher and Waukesha engines. The heavy-duty gas turbines generate power and heat for industrial facilities, often located in harsh and remote environments.GE CEO John Flannery last year revealed plans to shed $20 billion in assets and slash billions in costs. Last month, he took the biggest step so far in his turnaround plan for the troubled conglomerate, merging GE's century-old railroad business with Wabtec (WAB) in a complex deal worth $11 billion.The industrial gas engines unit, which posted sales of $1.32 billion in 2017, attracted the interest of various buyout firms besides Cummins, according to reports. Cummins makes engines and generators.Shares lost 2.3% at 12.75 on the stock market today, as the Dow Jones industrial average sold off amid an escalating Trump trade war. Wabtech fell 2% and Cummins lost 1.3%, hitting a 52-week low. GE's former Dow peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, on Monday.GE was booted from the Dow Jones industrial average last week and is poised to be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on Tuesday.S&P Dow Jones Indices, which helps determine which stocks are in the Dow Jones industrial average, explained last week why it made the switch.Meanwhile, GE's stock has collapsed by more than 50% in the last year and a half.The distributed-power transaction affects roughly 3,000 employees in Austria, Canada and the U.S.It's part of GE's core power unit, which produces a third of the world's electricity but has been battered by a downturn in demand for power-plant equipment.RBC Capital Markets said the deal should not involve any significant dis-synergies, since distributed power operates mostly as a stand-alone business within GE Power.""In terms of the stock reaction, we do not believe that this $3.25 billion deal is a major needle-mover, as it represents just the latest small asset sale from GE's ongoing portfolio streamlining initiative,"" said RBC analyst Deane Dray. ""But the announcement checks the box on another divestiture/simplification action.""The gas-engines transaction is set to close by the fourth quarter, subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

35,CMI,"Navistar (NAV) stock gapped up Monday amid reports that Volkswagen (VLKAY) may buy the portion of the heavy-duty-truck company it doesn't already own.XThe German automotive giant's trucking division is eyeing Navistar as it seeks scale to compete with global leaders Daimler (DDAIF) and Volvo.Volkswagen Truck & Bus CFO Matthias Gruendler said at a press conference in Munich Monday that a takeover would ""make sense at some point.""The executive also cited a potential price point of between ""3 to 4 billion,"" but did not specify if he was talking about dollars or euros. In addition, he did not give a time scale as to when his company would look to increase their stake.Shares in Navistar, a laggard in the Trucks And Parts-Heavy Duty industry group with an IBD Composite Rating of 40, shot up 9.85% to close at 40.71 on the stock market today. Among other stocks in the group, Cummins (CMI) climbed 2.6%, Paccar (PCAR) rose 2.4%, Oshkosh (OSK) gained 1.3%, and Spartan Motors (SPAR) added 2.6%. Tesla (TSLA), which is building an electric big-rig truck, fell 3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

He also said VW would have to make a formal takeover offer under U.S. law if it raises its stake in Navistar above 17%.The German company is looking to dramatically grow its truck business, and is considering a stock market listing to raise expansion funds.Navistar crushed earnings estimates back in December, and in a prophetic turn CEO Troy Clarke said the company wanted to strengthen its relationship with VW.""We will build on our alliance with Volkswagen Truck & Bus by investing in and collaborating on the major technologies that are reshaping our industry, including electric, connectivity and autonomous,"" he said in a statement.

If demand for a particular therapy proves strong, the factory can expand to increase output.This allows drug manufacturers to quickly adapt to market conditions, GE Healthcare said in a news release.Shares popped 3.5% to finish at 13.79 on the stock market today. GE also benefited from reports of a potential sale for its Jenbacher gas-engine unit. Bloomberg said the deal with power company Cummins (CMI) and a private equity firm could value the Austrian unit for more than $3 billion– $1 billion more than reports in January indicated. GE is targeting $20 billion in asset sales as it battles a slump in profits.Dow Jones industrial average peers also closed higher; United Technologies (UTX) 0.6% and 3M (MMM) 1.1%. Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) both rose 1.3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe popularity of viral vectors, which use modified viruses to carry healthy genetic code into sick target cells, is on the increase.There are more than 700 viral vector-based therapies in clinical trials, GE's $18 billion healthcare business said. Several treatments — such as GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Strimvelis, Novartis's (NVS) Kymriah and Kite Pharma-Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Yescarta — already have received regulatory approvals.""The market is moving towards more targeted therapies designed for smaller patient populations,"" Olivier Loeillot, a GE general manager, said in Tuesday's statement. But existing large-scale factories are not ideal for drug manufacturers looking to produce small batches of therapies, he added.Additionally, the KUBio factories can help drug makers to lower costs.Many advanced drug candidates for treating Ebola — the deadly West African outbreak —also use viral vector technology. The factory-in-a-box solution can address challenges tied to producing vaccines, which are critical to people around the world but generate low revenue for their manufacturers, the company says.GE looks to grow in the gene therapy business as it battles a severe downturn in its gas-turbine and power-plant business.  The power unit is likely to show a hit when first-quarter results come out Friday.Gene therapy is a risky but promising technique that may one day  allow doctors to treat disorders without conventional drugs or surgery, according to the National Institutes of Health.

FCA US has proposed a number of actions to address EPA's concerns, including developing extensive software changes to our emissions control strategies that could be implemented in these vehicles immediately to further improve emissions performance.""The automaker said it plans to work with the incoming Trump administration. President-elect Trump recently praised Fiat Chrysler for its U.S. jobs and investment plans.Fiat Chrysler shares, which had hit an all-time high of 11.32 early, tumbled even before the 11 a.m. ET announcement as Reuters reported that the EPA action was imminent.Fiat Chrysler shares traded as low as 9.12 but rebounded somewhat to 9,95, still off 10.3% in the stock market today.Truck engine maker Cummins (CMI) fell 1.5%.

58,CMI,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

62,CMI,"Looking at its chart, the engines seem to be revving for Cummins. Not only does it offer a base breakout on Friday, but also a high dividend growth rate and large cash flow.Cummins (CMI) broke out in the stock market today, crossing a 127.74 buy point from a shallow six-week correction. While turnover wasn't impressive relative to its 50-day average, it was the heaviest since its options expiration on Sept. 16.Going back further on the chart shows a stock recovering from a long consolidation that saw a correction of 50% over 18 months starting in 2014. The point? It's a stark reminder why dividend yield plays second fiddle to cutting losses in capital. As the stock made it back above its 200-day moving average, it saw a breakout at 120.28 on July 26 from a shallow correction. Cummins rose 6% before forming the most recent milder consolidation.The diesel and natural gas engine maker is not a new company; it was born in 1919 in Indiana as one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. The company went public in 1947. As it stands now, Cummins has broadened its reach globally, getting 40% of its revenue from outside of the U.S. and Canada.In its second-quarter earnings report, the company noted that it saw weaker revenue in three out of four of its segments: engine, components, and power systems. Its distribution segment had a revenue increase but that was due to acquisitions rather than organic growth. The company also had to deal with currency headwinds as the strong dollar hurt currency translations for its overseas business. No surprise, those factors had a negative effect on earnings growth with the most recent four quarters showing declines.However, operating cash flows have increased nicely, with the company citing lower working capital requirements. Cummins is forecasting growth in China and India to offset weakness in Brazil and North America. They have also seen 11% growth in light-duty automotive engines -- basically a pickup in pickup trucks, a final destination for many Cummins diesel engines.Cummins sports an annual yield of 3.3% with its dividend at an annualized $4.10 per share. IBD data shows a long-term dividend growth rate of 28%, boosted by the last hike on July 12.RELATED:5 Top Stocks Offering Big Dividend Growth RatesCummins Stock Rises Despite Downturn In Its Markets

The stock has been in a gradual uptrend since July, working to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Apple (AAPL) rose 2% at the open, after advancing nearly 2% in above-average volume Monday. The stock appears to be receiving a boost from Samsung's decision to halt sales and production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to overheating batteries. Apple shares ended Monday extended just beyond buy range above a 110.33 buy point in a cup with handle base.Illumina (ILMN) crashed 25% at the open. The maker of gene-sequencing tools slashed its Q3 and Q4 revenue guidance due to a fall off in sales of its high-volume sequencing equipment.Cummins (CMI) and Caterpillar (CAT) crawled up less than 1% after Goldman Sachs upgraded both stocks to buy.

64,CMI,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base. Spectra Energy (SE), International Paper (IP) and Enbridge (ENB) are all four weeks into flat consolidations, which point to more possible bases maturing the week beginning October 17.Rising Optimism Among This Insurer's Clients Bode Well For Its StockCummins' Triple Threat: Dividend Growth, Cash Flow And Big Price GainsBank Stocks Have Work To Do, But Could Be Worth WatchingCisco Systems Spending $4 Billion In Mexico

So after they move on rates in December investors/traders will want to know what the plan is going forward.

Pending home sales worse than expected and this morning's Journal - well don't look for presents under the tree in terms of the economy.""Companies Shy Away from Spending"" - Investment is 'fizzling'; Companies are reluctant to spend on capex the most recent measure shows a decline of 3.8% in the first 10 months of the year; Stock buybacks are up 10.4% in the 3rd qtr alone suggesting that companies see little reason to achieve good return via capital investments.""Morgan Stanley  (MS) to CUT a Quarter of Bond, Currency Trading Jobs"" - Trading revenue slump prompts a review of staffing needs. Morgan plans to slash hundreds of jobs, joining their peers in the annual slash and burn of employees. But finance jobs are not the only ones at risk, retailers, manufacturers and energy companies have all signaled tougher times ahead, and job cuts on the table. Diesel engine manufacturer Cummins's (CMI) CEO Tom Linebarger lays it out clearly, ""With no clear signs of improvement in the near term, we are now implementing additional restructuring - which includes 2,000 layoffs and a widespread review of manufacturing capacity....""  On the positive side of the ledger sheet - our friend Chris Concannon - CEO of BATS Global Markets -  announces a 2016 Plan to IPO.....saying that they are worth more than $2 bil. or more than 3X their 2012 $760 mil valuation. Amazing what HFT and sub-pennies will do for valuations. The only question is - Can they IPO without blowing up again?Ok...so back to the FED......and the argument that they must raise rates to get out in front of this overheating economy is almost laughable..... with every economic report showing signs of an  economy that is gasping for breath as we battle possible deflation.  But - as noted above - Yellen and her band of merry men are backed into a corner.....so a 25 bps rise is sure to happen......but my sense is that she will back off of any further talk of hikes in the near term.....which should serve to stabilize the mkts and allow for more time for the economy to catch up......so is there really any reason for the mkt to 'surge' from here....not so much, but is there any reason for the mkt to plunge either....again, not so much...... and so the churn continues....US futures are up 7 pts this morning at 2087.........ok...great - down 10 yesterday, up 7 today......get the picture?  We are still in the 2065/2100 range...and that my friends is where I suspect we will remain for now.   Eco data today includes US Market Manf PMI - exp of 52.6, ISM Manf of 50.5, ISM Prices Paid of 40.....and don't forget the FED speakers....Evans at 12:45 and Brainard at 8 pm......Overnight in Asia - Mkts rallied....Japan pierces 20k on the Nikkei,  In China - more disappointing macro data.....Manf PMI declined to 49.6...while the Services PMI rang the bell at 53.6.....so you have ying and yang....and the promise of more stimulus.....In another move - the IMF has admitted the Chinese Yuan into the Big Boys Room - making it a reserve currency starting in October 2016......with Christine Lagarde saying that it was ""a recognition of the progress that the Chinese authorities have made in the past years in reforming China's monetary and financial systems.""    Japan +1.34% , Hong Kong +1.75%,  China +0.32% and ASX +1.9%. In Europe  mkts are mixed but mostly higher..... The Eurozone unemployment report shows that unemployment is falling -  going from 10.8% to 10.7%. - OK...nothing to write home about BUT it did fall!    The countdown is on for Thursday's ECB statement..... FTSE+0.52%, CAC 40 -0.11%, DAX -0.02%, Eurostoxx +0.09%, Spain +0.48% and Italy +0.36%.   Take good care —  Kp Kenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

96,CMI,"The October jobs report is due out Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. And it's even more important than usual, with a Fed rate hike hanging in the balance. Here are three key things to look for.1. Will Fed Get A Go Signal?Hiring abruptly stalled in the last two months, with nonfarm payrolls up just 142,000 in September and a downwardly revised 136,000 in August. Private hiring had the worst back-to-back gain in three years. The Federal Reserve is signaling a December rate hike, and markets are starting to believe it. But if hiring remains sluggish, it will be hard for policymakers to pull the trigger.Wall Street is predicting a rise of 190,000 nonfarm jobs in October. Economists also may be expecting an upward revision to September.2. How Hard Hit Is Manufacturing?Manufacturing lost 9,000 jobs in September after falling by 18,000 in August. Manufacturers are exposed to overseas economic woes, a strong dollar and weak energy prices. Mining and construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB), 3M (MMM) and heavy truck engine maker Cummins (CMI) have all announced layoff plans in the last several months.Manufacturing output is still growing, modestly. But with manufacturing productivity ramping up, that may not be enough to maintain factory employment. If factories continue to shed high-paying blue-collar jobs, can services and construction activity offset that?3. Will Weekly Earnings Remain Weak?When economists discuss wages in the jobs report, they usually focus on average hourly wages.September hourly wages actually fell by 1 cent vs. August. But the year-over-year gain remained 2.2%, which is more or less where it's been for years.But workers are paid by the hourly wage, but by how many hours they work. The work week fell in September to 34.5 hours. So weekly earnings rose by 2.2% vs. a year earlier vs. 2.8% in January. (Weekly wages among nonsupervisory employees rose just 1.6%, down from a recent peak of 3% in July 2014.)The good news is the inflation-adjusted wage gains remain solid, because price gains have been nonexistent. But starting in December and January, real wage gains will quickly fade as easy oil and gas comparisons end. So nominal weekly pay will become more pressing.Economists are counting on October hourly earnings to rise by 0.2%, with the workweek unchanged at 34.5 hours.

And quiet it was and fail it did……yesterday morning the market traded right up from the opening bell……tested the highs from last week —…
"
193,CMI,"Stocks on Monday failed to hold onto the early gains — as worries over the macro data, dollar strength and earnings once again weighed on traders' minds. All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?
"
194,CMI,"Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials. Rising legal and regulatory expenses, slowing mortgage lending, a decrease in trading revenues, a collapsing energy space all will play into the mix… YTD - though, financials have underperformed the broader mkt.....down about 2% for the group....followed only by energy and utilities.......
"
195,CMI,"But like we said — earnings represent history — what is important is what the future looks like….and recently the Credit Managers Index (CMI) has reported an increase in rejected credit applications — this spike coming only in the last month — too late for any real impact on 1st qtr earnings but a clear indicator of what may be in store. With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.

Oil declines in price bringing untold benefits to transportation companies along with a host of others and now Norfolk Southern tells us that earnings could be down 15% because they CAN'T charge higher fuel surcharges?

All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials. Rising legal and regulatory expenses, slowing mortgage lending, a decrease in trading revenues, a collapsing energy space all will play into the mix… YTD - though, financials have underperformed the broader mkt.....down about 2% for the group....followed only by energy and utilities.......But like we said — earnings represent history — what is important is what the future looks like….and recently the Credit Managers Index (CMI) has reported an increase in rejected credit applications — this spike coming only in the last month — too late for any real impact on 1st qtr earnings but a clear indicator of what may be in store. With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.In healthcare — Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is the bellwether...and they are also due to report....here investors will be keenly aware of the $ impact - but remember - like Alcoa (AA) - Johnson & Johnson should also see a benefit from overseas operations that are helped by weaker currencies abroad - it's not all about the $.....I'm just sayin.....Last night after the bell - we heard from Norfolk Southern (NSC) - in pre-release commentary - they prepared investors for a disappointment - not because of the dollar ..Oh No....it was because of 'lower fuel SURCHARGE revenue'.....(and lower coal shipments).....but isn't this just a kick in the pants? Oil declines in price bringing untold benefits to transportation companies along with a host of others and now Norfolk Southern tells us that earnings could be down 15% because they CAN'T charge higher fuel surcharges?(A surcharge is an ADD'L charge or payment on top of a regular cost.....so if investors are buying Norfolk - because they are able to increase revenues by increasing surcharges - then someone should think about a new portfolio manager......Surcharges do not represent organic growth, or an improved outlook - they only represent the ability of companies to fleece their clients with add'l fees etc...... Where is the investment theory in that?) The stock traded down some 4% in after hours as the algo's punished it.....This morning - US futures are a bit lower as the drama unfolds.....currently - 2 pts at 2085.....like I said yesterday - I expect the mkt to find stability at the 50 DMA of 2075......unless the banks so screw it up - then I would expect sentiment to remain fairly upbeat......remember - the mkt is expecting earnings GROWTH in healthcare, 10%, Financials, 8%, consumer disc, 6%, and the industrials of 5%.....the disappointments are expected to come from energy - down some 60% (but that is not a surprise), materials down 5%, telecoms down 4%, IT down 1.5%......The forward guidance is the key.....US companies that book large volumes of int'l sales will likely be a bit more cautious in the face of the strong dollar (as they cover their backsides), but those same multinationals that also have overseas operations will benefit from the weaker local currencies. Add in the continued monetary policies of global central banks and BOOM.....the mkt can never really correct..... and by correct I do not mean a 5% move off the highs -Today we get retail sales....analysts expect to see a surge......making last month's reading a non issue....they will argue the weather story and then tell us how healthy and strong the consumer is......etc.....that will then cause the pundits to re-hash the rate increase conversation, which will then spook the algos....and it is a vicious circle.....Do not get drawn into the rate increase story....it ain't happening in June, nor in September.....Speaking of the FED - watch for NY Pres Dudley to speak at 8:40 am and Minneapolis Pres Kocherlakota to speak at 8 pm.....well after the mkts close - but remember - he is an ultra uber dove....so the algo's will be listening......European mkts are a bit lower even on strong data.....EMU Industrial Production (European Monetary Union) easily beat the estimates...coming in +1.1% vs exp of +0.3%.....Italian and British CPI both met the expectations and the ECB continues to feed the beast.....the small pullback we are seeing only represents some profit taking as these mkts have exploded to the upside in the past 3 months...so caution ahead of earnings is prudent....taking some money off the table - while keeping a core position in stocks you like is never a bad investment decision.....FTSE +0.16%, CAC 40 - 0.57%, DAX - 0.60%, EUROSTOXX -0.94%, SPAIN -01.02% and ITALY -1.12%.In case you missed it - Florida's Marco Rubio (43 yrs old) launched his campaign for President last night.....and boy is he picking a fight....did you hear his speech - very good in fact - but he is taking no prisoners....emphasizing age over experience....(haven't we had enough of that?) taking a direct shot at Bush (62 yrs old) & Hillary (67 yrs old) .....Saying :""The time has come for our generation to lead the way towards a new American century""...... Wait....help me out here......Wasn't that what Obama was supposed to do?In a direct shot at Hillary - he had this to say:""Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president promising to take us back to yesterday......Yesterday is over and we are never going back"".....And the blood continues to pour out..... Sit back, grab some popcorn - the night is young.......Take good care.Kenny Polcari is director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

237,CMI,"The week saw the release of the auto sales report for the month of June. U.S. auto sales jumped in the month, defying the odds of rising interest rates, higher gas prices and large supply of used vehicles. While the first half of the year saw auto sales rise 1.8%, sales in June increased 5% compared with a year ago. Strong consumer confidence and low level of unemployment boosted auto sales.There is however the lurking fear of this joyride being derailed due to President Trump’s proposed tariffs. In fact, the auto industry, which relies heavily on a complicated global supply chain and is adapting to a spate of technological changes such as autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs) technology, is likely to be adversely impacted by this trade policy.Other than the June sales report and tariff concerns, the week saw Tesla, Inc.’s (TSLA  -  Free Report) vehicle production reaching a historic level in the second quarter of 2018, making it the most-productive three-month period.

At the end of January, it announced acquiring Johnson Matthey’s UK automotive battery systems business that focuses on high-voltage automotive-grade battery systems for electric and hybrid vehicles.

This makes it exposed to bigger North American peers with greater financial resources. Also, it competes with low-cost producers in Asia, Mexico, South America and Central Europe. If the company fails to improve its operating efficiencies compared with its peers, it might suffer.The company is also facing rise in capital expenses, primarily due to volatile raw material prices.

While geopolitical tensions, renewed fears over the implementation of President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda, an uncertain Fed policy and high stock valuations are weighing on the stocks, strong corporate earnings, and improving health of economies around the world act as tailwinds.This is especially true as the economy has been on a solid growth path buoyed by an impressive labor market, increase in wages, and higher consumer spending. U.S. GDP growth expanded 2.6% annually in the second quarter, which is double the first-quarter growth of 1.2% and represents the fastest growth since the third quarter of last year, when the economy grew 2.8%.Consumers also appear to be more optimistic with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment rising to the highest level since January, reflecting confidence in the outlook for the economy. Further, retail sales recorded the biggest increase in seven months in July (read: Retail Sales Off to a Great Start to Q3: ETFs to Buy).Given improving economic fundamentals and heightened uncertainty, investors should focus on high-quality investing through a basket form.Why Quality Investing?Quality stocks are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins, and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth. These stocks thus reduce volatility when compared to plain vanilla funds and hold up rather well during market swings. Further, academic research shows that high-quality companies consistently deliver superior risk-adjusted returns than the broader market over the long term.Given this, we have highlighted five solid picks each from the ETF and stock worlds, targeting this niche strategy. Any of these could enjoy smooth trading and outperform the U.S. market in the coming months.ETF PicksiShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to stocks exhibiting positive fundamentals (high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage) by tracking the MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index.

264,CMI,"While investors avoid stocks that do not have juicy yields, it is true that these low-yield stocks have a solid history of dividend growth that lead to outperformance. This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation even in a volatile market.Inside The Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report): This California-based company is a provider of internet infrastructure solutions that enable internet service providers and other telecommunications service providers to meet demand resulting from the rapid growth of the internet.

265,CMI,"Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 0.9%. Over the trailing four quarters, it topped estimates twice, while missing the same in the other two, with an average surprise of a negative of 1.79%.Shares of Genuine Parts have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has lost 13.5% compared with the industry’s 10.3% decline. Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise  Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise | Genuine Parts Company Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe company regularly undertakes acquisitions to expand the business. In November 2017, Genuine Parts completed the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group (""AAG""), the second largest parts distribution platform in Europe. This assisted the company to expand footprint in the European markets. This has also aided it to raise future expectations. The to-be-reported quarterly results are likely to be positively impacted by the contribution from AAG's operations.Further, to boost top-and bottom-line growth, the company is focusing to expand the product line to penetrate new markets.However, rising cost of labor and delivery, as well as ongoing planned IT spending, is resulting in a continuous rise of its Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses that are hampering the gross margin figure.Also, the company’s long-term debt increased to $2.6 billion in 2017 in comparison with $550 million in the prior year. High debt means that a huge share of Genuine Parts earnings will be given to the debt holders as interest, thereby lowering contributions for shareholders.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of -0.38% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31 and $1.32, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Genuine Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, this combined with its Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering, comprising the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this time around:Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s first-quarter 2018 financial results are expected to be released on May 1.

266,CMI,"On Apr 11, we issued an updated research report on Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (PAG  -  Free Report).The automotive and commercial truck dealership company is expanding dealership network to boost earnings. At the end of 2017, it operated 20 medium and heavy-duty truck dealerships in the United States and Canada, which sold 2,294 units and generated $308.2 million revenues. The company also acquires other existing dealerships to increase dealership-count in regions where it has a limited presence.In order to expand international presence, in January, the company completed the acquisition of The Car People, a used-vehicle seller based in the United Kingdom. The acquisition is anticipated to generate annualized revenues of roughly $300 million. Prior to this, in February 2017, Penske Automotive bought another U.K.-based used-vehicle retailer, CarShop.Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Price and Consensus Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Quote These acquisitions will help the company to reinforce its position in the U.K. by developing the used-car business segment, which is the second-largest market for Penske Automotive. In 2017, its U.K. market contributed 33% in total revenues compared with 32% recorded in the year-ago period.In order to boost shareholders’ confidence, Penske Automotive engages in regular share repurchase programs and dividend payments.  In almost every quarter, the company increased the quarterly dividend from preceding payouts by roughly 1 cent. In January 2018, it hiked to 34 cents from the prior payout of 33 cents for fourth-quarter 2017.However, Penske Automotive is witnessing a gradual decline in volume growth. In fourth-quarter 2017, new and used-vehicle volume grew 7%, sequentially, compared with 10% and 13%, recorded in the second and third quarter of 2017. This might hamper its financials if the similar trend continues.Also, competition among peers and exposure to foreign currency fluctuations might slow down company’s growth.Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of Penske Automotive have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 4.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 0.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPenske Automotive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Fox Factory Holding Corp. (FOXF  -  Free Report), Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) and BorgWarner Inc.

268,CMI,"On Tuesday, China’s President Xi Jinping said that his government is committed to opening up its economy to foreign investors. U.S. markets welcomed his speech, which struck a conciliatory note, helping to reduce trade-related tensions. Among his many promises, Xi promised to provide better protection for intellectual property rights and reduce tariffs on imported cars.Stocks of major U.S. automakers gained on Xi’s comments since China is a major market for U.S. auto exports. Foreign automakers using the United States as a manufacturing and export base would also gain from this move. This is why it makes good sense to pick up stocks likely to benefit from China’s upcoming reforms related to trade and foreign investment.U.S. Auto Stocks Welcome Xi’s CommentsSpeaking at the Boao Forum for Asia, Xi said China would cut tariffs on imported automobiles. Further, the foreign ownership limit on automotive companies, among others, would be raised “as soon as possible.” Currently, foreign automakers cannot own more than 50% of the joint ventures they are mandated to establish with local firms when operating inside China.Consequently, they also have to share 50% of their profits with such Chinese partners. This is why Xi’s comments boosted U.S. auto stocks significantly. Shares of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) gained 3.3%, 1.8% and 5.2%, respectively, on Tuesday.Tesla was possibly the largest gainer since it makes all of the autos it exports to China at its plant in California. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has stated on earlier occasions that he wishes to retain complete ownership of any manufacturing facility it sets up in China. In a tweet after Li’s speech Xi said: “This is a very important action by China.”China a Crucial Market for U.S. AutomakersIn a tweet made less than a day before Xi’s speech Trump had criticized China’s 25% tariff on U.S. cars, emphasizing that the United States only levies 2.5% in return. Just hours after calling such a state of things “stupid trade”, Trump welcomed Xi’s comments. The President said he was “thankful” for Xi’s comments on tariffs and his “enlightenment” on intellectual property issues.The jump in shares of U.S. auto companies is understandable considering that China is a major market for its cars. In January, General Motors said that China had remained its largest retail market for the sixth consecutive year. For Tesla, China is the second largest market in terms of revenues after the United States.Even bigger winners of Xi’s proposed reforms could be German automakers who manufacture and export their vehicles to China from the United States. According to data from LMC Automotive, Mercedes, owned by Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report), sent 71,198 vehicles from the United States to China in 2017, while BMW, owned by Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BAMXF  -  Free Report), sent 106,971 vehicles.Our ChoicesMarkets have responded enthusiastically to President Xi’s comments, especially automotive stocks, which stand to benefit significantly from the reforms proposed by the Chinese president. Not only would they have to pay lower duties on imported vehicles, they would also be able to hold a larger stake in their Chinese joint ventures.U.S. auto companies, related organizations and foreign automakers exporting to China from the United States make for good investments at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

270,CMI,"CarMax Inc. (KMX  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Feb 28, 2018) results on Apr 4, before the opening bell. Last quarter, this specialty retailer of used vehicles delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.2%.The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5%. CarMax has expected long-term growth rate of 14.8%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.CarMax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CarMax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CarMax, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterCarMax aims at the used-car market and is one of the strongest among the peers. In fiscal 2017, used vehicle sales rose 6.7%, supported by an 8.3% year-over-year increase in used-car units sold. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, CarMax’s total used-vehicle unit sales rose 8.2%, which is likely to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter.The Richmond, VA-based company is also following an aggressive store expansion scheme in order to grow its presence in the existing and new markets. It opened total six stores during the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, CarMax opened five stores.A significant increase in cash outflows from operations and rising capital expenditures might affect CarMax’s revenues.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of used-vehicle retail is pegged at $3.6 billion, up from the fiscal third quarter’s net sales of $3.4 billion.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of the company’s wholesale vehicles stands at $499 million, down from the fiscal second quarter’s net sales of $552.8 million.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other sales and revenues is expected to be $135 million, up from the fiscal third quarter’s figure of $129 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CarMax is likely to beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CarMax has an Earnings ESP of -3.51% as the Most Accurate estimate of 86 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents.

271,CMI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Cummins has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.9. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Cummins’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16.3 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.However, the stock’s PE stands above the Zacks Auto – Tires – Trucks sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.4. This indicates that the stock is relatively stretched right now, compared to its peers.Nonetheless, we should also point out that Cummins has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Cummins stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Cummins has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Cummins currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Cummins a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Cummins might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C. This gives CMI a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision, while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has jumped 6.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Cummins Inc. Price and Consensus  Cummins Inc. Price and Consensus | Cummins Inc. QuoteHowever, this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nevertheless, the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock’s prospects in the near term look good.Bottom LineCummins is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 48% of more than 250 industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

272,CMI,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to buy a B2B eCommerce software provider, which will mark the company’s second acquisition this year. Though the world’s leading customer-relationship management-solution provider has not made any announcement regarding this, the to-be-acquired company — CloudCraze — has revealed this news on its website. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Founded in 2009, this Chicago-based start-up provides eCommerce platform to enterprises. The company’s B2B commerce software is built on Salesforce’s platform. Till its formation, CloudCraze had raised more than $30 million through venture funding, according to Crunchbase. Notably, Salesforce’s investment arm — Salesforce Ventures — had backed the company’s $20-million funding round in 2017.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionThe transaction is believed to be beneficial for Salesforce as the acquisition will enhance its capabilities and thereby help capture the growing opportunity in the B2B commerce industry. President and chief customer officer of CloudCraze, Ray Grady, in his blog yesterday, noted that the industry is anticipated to reach a value of $1.2 trillion by 2021 from the $889 billion at present.Furthermore, CloudCraze has a strong customer base with some big names like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Adidas, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report), Ecolab, Land O’ Lakes, and WABCO. Therefore, with this acquisition, Salesforce will be able to pitch its existing B2B clients to use CloudCraze’s software.Bottom LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although the company remained almost silent throughout 2017 on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), this year it might repeat the likes of 2016, when Salesforce bought 12 companies, to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets.We believe Salesforce’s continued focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Notably, the stock has appreciated 51.6% over the past year, significantly outperforming 40.2% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

273,CMI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CMI due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Cummins Q4 Earnings Top Estimates, Guidance RevisedCummins reported adjusted earnings of $3.03 per share in fourth-quarter 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.65. The company’s bottom line was $2.25 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the tax reform impact, net income was $503 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Revenues improved 22% year over year to $5.48 billion in the reported quarter.

287,CMI,"The U.S. stock market no doubt has been on a stellar ride, touching fresh highs on several occasions. When the stock market surges, the U.S. dollar tends to struggle and this is what we are seeing now.Though the dollar index moved higher from a 15-month low against the basket of major currencies following the upbeat July job data report, it is down nearly 9% in the year-to-date timeframe. Additionally, the index recorded its worst run of monthly losses last month since early 2011. PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish Fund (UUP  -  Free Report), tracking the dollar index, shed 9.2% in the year-to-date time frame. This is primarily thanks to rounds of weak economic data, North Korean nuclear missile tests, geopolitical tensions, political turmoil in Washington and diminished expectations for a third rate hike this year.In particular, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in her latest testimony, stated that she is not in a rush to raise interest rates given muted inflation. It will continue to follow a gradual rate hike plan and unwinding of its massive balance sheet. Per the central bank, interest rates are close to the neutral level – a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity (read: Asset Rollback Top Priority of Fed: ETFs in Focus).Additionally, fading hopes in the implementation of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda after the failure of healthcare bill added to the woes of the greenback. Further, rejuvenated economic growth in Europe and the prospect of an end to its cheap monetary policy era has dealt an additional blow to the dollar. The prospect of a trade war with China and renewed tension on the Korean Peninsula are further weighing on the dollar lately.Weak Dollar: A BoonA weak dollar has fueled a superb rally in blue chip companies, which derive most of their revenues from international markets. Notably, Dow Jones broke through the 22,000 milestone for the first time on August 2. This is because weak dollar has made dollar-denominated assets cheap for foreign investors making U.S. multinationals more competitive thereby leading to increased profits. As such, companies having a higher percentage of international sales will likely outperform (read: Dow at Record High: More Upside for ETFs?).Further, commodities and emerging markets stocks are also getting a lift from a weak dollar. Given this, we have highlighted four ETFs and stocks that are benefiting from the current trend and are likely to do as long as dollar remains weak.ETFs To Bet OnVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK  -  Free Report)With AUM of $3.1 billion, this ETF offers diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market by tracking the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index.

EEM charges 72 bps in fees per year from investors and has gained 25.6% so far this year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or ‘Hold’ rating with a Medium risk outlook (read: Top Emerging Market ETFs of First Half 2017).PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (UDN  -  Free Report)This fund could be the prime beneficiary of the falling dollar as it offers exposure to the basket of six world currencies against the U.S. dollar. This is done by tracking the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index Futures Index Excess Return plus the interest income from the fund’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.

290,CMI,"The stock market is marching higher, hitting multiple fresh highs amid Washington turmoil, geopolitical risks and lofty valuation. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems a perfect choice. These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation.Why Dividend Growth Investing Is Better?Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds –– potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market. This is because these stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are six of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report): This Georgia-based company is America's fastest growing international carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and internationally.

313,CMI,"Customers are spoilt for choice with multiple brand new or soon-to-be launched electric cars flooding the market. These new age models with upgraded features have been wooing clients, leading to a steady rise in sales. In September, electric car sales surged 55% from the prior-year period.However, per a report in The Washington Post, one in six vehicles bought in the United States is a pick-up truck. This swell in demand for trucks, silently entering into the transportation fleet of the Americans, has encouraged top automakers to focus on all-electric battery powered trucks alongside the electric cars.Trucks play an important role in last mile deliveries in the spate of home delivery services in densely-populated residential areas. Currently, most of these delivery trucks run on gasoline or diesel combustion engines, aggravating the air and noise pollution for residents. Parallel to this, it increases accident risks for the drivers on road.Hence, silent and emission-free electric trucks can solve a few of the above-mentioned problems. Selection of electric trucks will reduce health risks related to environmental issues. Further, these eco-friendly trucks will help drivers focus more on driving owing to its noiseless facility.Companies Already in the RaceA few automakers have already started gearing up for introducing their electric trucks or powertrains to cater to the multibillion-dollar trucking industry. With fierce competition heating up, let’s sneak a peek into the plans of a few good companies on determining their electric truck journey.In August, Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) unveiled its all-electric Class 7 electric truck powertrain for auto manufacturers. The powertrain has a battery of 145 kWh and has the capability to haul a 22 ton trailer stretching up to 100 miles. Also, the recharging time for the batteries will last an hour, using a 140 kW charger. The company is planning to start production of this powertrain in 2019.Navistar International Corporation (NAV  -  Free Report) and German automaker, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) are coming together to unveil an electric medium duty truck in North America by 2019. This collaboration will also develop hardware and systems to connect trucks with the Internet.In September, Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report), a German manufacturer and seller of premium cars and commercial vehicles, announced its plan to introduce the first series of all-electric light-duty trucks, namely, FUSO eCanter. The company will be manufacturing the truck series through its Trucks business unit, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, which it will cater to the customers across Europe, Japan and the United States. The production of this series is also expected to start in 2019 and the company has plans to deliver 500 units from the output to its clients. Good news is that the automaker has already gained its first U.S. commercial customer for the series, which is United Parcel Service, Inc.The most talked-about unveiling in the recent times is Tesla Inc.’s (TSLA  -  Free Report) first electric, almost self-driving heavy-duty semi truck. Features will include speedier acceleration, improved uphill performance and windshield with thermonuclear explosion-proof glass. The production of this truck will start in 2019.Also, many companies have already placed their order for the new Tesla semi-truck, some of which includes multinational retail corporation Walmart, grocery giant Loblaw Companies, moving company JK Moving Services (provider of storing and moving services) and DHL, each ordering 15, 25, 4 and 10 units, respectively.However, witnessing Tesla’s Model 3 production backlogs, it will be quite interesting to watch how the company manages to start its semi-truck production by 2019 and complete delivering its orders in time.Navistar sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), whereas Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank# 2 (Buy), Daimler and Volkswagen carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Tesla has a Zacks Rank # 4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term growth rate for Cummins, Navistar, Daimler, Volkswagen and Tesla is 12.2%, 5%, 2.8%, 12.9% and 25%, respectively.Challenges AheadA major hurdle that the automakers will face is to develop efficient truck batteries. Carrying large loads over long distances at a single charge will be a challenge for these trucks to cope with. Also, usage of heavy batteries might take a toll on the trucks’ performance as the vehicles have to exhaust energy both for the battery and the vehicle.Per a report released by Carnegie Mellon University, one would require battery that weighs more than the cargo to drive a semi-truck for 600 miles, which might exceed the gross weight of trucks to 40 tons, thus overstepping the federal limit.Additionally, in the initial years, the manufacturing companies have to balance its preliminary production costs with slim chances of making profit.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

318,CMI,"Customers are spoiled with choices for multiple brand new or soon-to-be launched electric cars flooding the market. These new age models with upgraded features have been wooing clients, leading to a steady rise in sales. In September, electric car sales surged 55% compared with the prior-year period.However, per a report in The Washington Post, one in six vehicles bought in the United States is a pick-up truck. This swell in demand for trucks, silently entering into the transportation fleet of the Americans, has encouraged top automakers to focus on all-electric battery-powered trucks alongside electric cars.Trucks play an important role in last mile deliveries in the spate of home delivery services in densely-populated residential areas. Currently, most of these delivery trucks run on gasoline or diesel combustion engines, aggravating the air and noise pollution for residents. Parallel to this, it increases accident risks for the drivers on road.Hence, silent and emission-free electric trucks can solve a few of the above-mentioned problems. Selection of electric trucks will reduce health risks related to environmental issues. Further, these eco-friendly trucks will help drivers focus more on driving owing to its noiseless facility.Companies Already in the RaceA few automakers have already started gearing up for introducing their electric trucks or powertrains to cater to the multibillion-dollar trucking industry. With fierce competition heating up, let’s sneak a peek into the plans of a few good companies on determining their electric truck journey.In August, Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) unveiled its all-electric Class 7 electric truck powertrain for auto manufacturers. The powertrain has a battery of 145 kWh and has the capability to haul a 22 ton trailer stretching up to 100 miles. Also, the recharging time for the batteries will last an hour, using a 140 kW charger. The company is planning to start production of this powertrain in 2019.Navistar International Corp. (NAV  -  Free Report) and German automaker, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) are coming together to unveil an electric medium duty truck in North America by 2019. This collaboration will also develop hardware and systems to connect trucks with the Internet.In September, Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report), a German manufacturer and seller of premium cars and commercial vehicles, announced its plan to introduce the first series of all-electric light-duty trucks, namely, FUSO eCanter. The company will be manufacturing the truck series through its Trucks business unit, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, which it will cater to the customers across Europe, Japan and the United States.The production of this series is also expected to start in 2019 and the company has plans to deliver 500 units from the output to its clients. Good news is that the automaker has already gained its first U.S. commercial customer for the series, which is United Parcel Service, Inc.The most talked-about unveiling in the recent times is Tesla Inc.’s (TSLA  -  Free Report) first electric, almost self-driving heavy-duty semi truck. Per management, the electric-truck would run 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds and will be able to cross 620 miles on a single charge.Additional features will include faster acceleration, better uphill performance and a thermonuclear explosion-proof glass in the windshield. For safety purposes, the truck will be enhanced with a sophisticated autopilot and lane-keeping technology. The production of this truck will begin in 2019.Also, many companies have already placed their order for the new Tesla Roadster, some of which includes multinational retail corporation Walmart, grocery giant Loblaw Companies, moving company JK Moving Services (provider of storing and moving services) and DHL, each ordering 15, 25, 4 and 10 units, respectively.However, witnessing Tesla’s Model 3 production backlogs, it will be quite interesting to watch how the company manages to start its semi-truck production by 2019 and complete delivering its orders in time.Both Cummins and Navistar sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy); Daimler and Volkswagen carry a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold) and Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term growth rate for Cummins, Navistar, Daimler, Volkswagen and Tesla is 12.2%, 5%, 2.8%, 12.9% and 25%, respectively.Challenges AheadA major hurdle that the automakers will face is to develop efficient truck batteries. Carrying large loads over long distances at a single charge will be a challenge for these trucks to cope with. Also, usage of heavy batteries might take a toll on the trucks’ performance as the vehicles have to exhaust energy both for the battery and the vehicle.Per a report released by Carnegie Mellon University, one would require battery that weighs more than the cargo to drive a semi-truck for 600 miles, which might exceed the gross weight of trucks to 40 tons, thus overstepping the federal limit.Additionally, in the initial years, the manufacturing companies have to balance its preliminary production costs with slim chances of making profit.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

328,CMI,"On Nov 20, we issued an updated research report on Tenneco Inc. (TEN  -  Free Report).On Oct 27, Tenneco reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 for third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 30, 2017), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59. Quarterly revenues jumped 8.5% year over year to $2.27 billion. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.23 billion.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenues to gain about 3% year over year on a constant currency basis. Further, it hopes to witness double-digit growth in commercial truck and off-highway revenues. However, the light vehicle sales are estimated to be equivalent to the industry that the company belongs to.Tenneco Inc. Price and Consensus Tenneco Inc. Price and Consensus | Tenneco Inc. QuoteTotal revenues for 2017 are expected to rise about 6% year over year on a constant currency basis.In order to improve revenues, product lines and drive long-term cash generation, Tenneco is diversifying its portfolio to grow its geographical footprint, customers as well as platforms. Further, it is making investments in working capital to support overall growth.In the third quarter, the company returned $85 million to its shareholders through buybacks and dividends. This shows Tenneco’s focus to enhance the shareholder value.As of fiscal 2016, Tenneco’s top 10 customers accounted for 63% of its sales, thus making the company heavily dependent on a handful few customers in the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) segment. This reliance on others also makes it vulnerable to price changing pressures from the OEMs.Weakening demand in European and North American off-highway markets and currency fluctuation are Tenneco’s other concerns.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share being revised 1.2% downward to $1.63 over the last 30 days.Price PerformanceLast month, shares of the company have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 10% compared with the industry’s 0.3% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksTenneco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked companies in the auto space include Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Wabco Holdings Inc. (WBC  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

329,CMI,"After surging to peak levels on Nov 7, the Wall Street is again entangled in a web of woes ranging from uncertainty in tax reform to a slide in oil prices (read: Looking to Buy The Dips? Here Are ETF & Stock Picks).This is especially true given that the tax plan unveiled by the Senate differs from that of House Republicans on various fronts that have raised concerns over the delay in the implementation of corporate tax cuts, which happened to be the major driver of the recent stock market rally. Meanwhile, oil price retreated from its two-year high reached on Nov 6 on a weak demand outlook and an increase in crude inventories. Further, the flattening of the yield curve has made investors jittery, as this signals economic slowdown.While the combination of these factors cannot be ignored, strong corporate earnings and improving health of economies around the world have been the strongest catalysts for the stock market rally this year. The dual tailwinds will continue to keep the positive momentum alive albeit at a slower pace.According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, all 45 countries are on track to grow this year and expected to continue the momentum in 2018. Per International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth is expected to be 3.6% this year and 3.7% in the next versus 3.2% last year. This would mark the fastest growth since 2010.The S&P 500 companies recorded two consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth for the first time since 2011 and are on pace for 6.3% growth in the third quarter. Additionally, total Q3 earnings are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the previous record reached in the preceding quarters (read: Q3 Earnings Effect: 5 Hottest ETF Charts).Apart from these, rounds of upbeat economic data and low interest rate policies from central banks around the world are adding to the strength. All these suggest that the second-largest bull market still has legs.Given bullish fundamentals and bouts of uncertainty, investors should focus on high-quality investing in a basket form.Why Quality Investing?Quality stocks are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins, and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth. These stocks thus reduce volatility when compared to plain vanilla funds and hold up rather well during market swings. Further, academic research shows that high-quality companies consistently deliver superior risk-adjusted returns than the broader market over the long term.Given this, we have highlighted four solid picks from the ETF and stock worlds, targeting this niche strategy. Any of these could enjoy smooth trading and generate market-beating returns in a current rocky market.ETFs to BuyiShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the stocks exhibiting positive fundamentals (high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage) by tracking the MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index.Expense Ratio: 0.15%AUM: $3.9 billionAverage Daily Volume: 259,000 sharesTop Sector: Information TechnologyYTD Returns: 16.6%PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the S&P 500 Quality Index, a benchmark of S&P 500 stocks that have the highest quality score based on three fundamental measures, return on equity, accruals ratio and financial leverage ratio.Expense Ratio: 0.29%AUM: $1.3 billionAverage Daily Volume: 158,000 sharesTop Sector: IndustrialsYTD Returns: 12.8%Barron's 400 ETF (BFOR  -  Free Report)This ETF seeks to track the performance of the rules-based and fundamentals-driven Barron’s 400 Index.

330,CMI,"For people who are approaching their retirement, investing can be bit of a challenge.Yes, we are talking about baby boomers, the generation born between 1946 and 1964 per the U.S. Census Bureau. This generation is one of the largest in the history of the United States, currently estimated to be 74.1 million in number and accounting for approximately 23% of the country’s population. The oldest members are now 72 years old, while the youngest are just about to turn 54.The first baby boomer officially retired in late 2007 and since then, the number has increased to millions over the past decade, as increasing number of baby boomers continue to reach their retirement age. Over the next 15-20 years, the majority of them will have left the workforce.But are they financially strong enough to maintain their lifestyle and meet healthcare costs post retirement?We Don’t Think SoPer Pew Charitable Trusts’ latest report, only 13% of working baby boomers are currently covered under pension schemes. This means the majority of retirees will need to plan their retirement on their own, making it the most challenging factor for the boomers.Furthermore, this generation is notably believed to be the most active and wealthiest group of their era. Also, baby boomers were the biggest beneficiary of the 1982-2000 secular bull market, which gave them the opportunity to make plenty of money through aggressive investment in stock markets.Despite this, the generation has not saved enough assets due to the boomers’ excessive spending habits and luxurious lifestyle, according to a Paladin Registry report. The report states that about 60% of baby boomers have inadequate assets for post retirement survival.Additionally, the generation is expected to have a longer life span — thanks to the advanced medical science and healthier lifestyles — which again means they need more funds for longer periods. Escalating healthcare costs is another challenge, which boomers have to face with increasing age.Therefore, as the majority of baby boomers are still working, they need to plan their investments to maintain their living standards post retirement.Things to Keep in MindIn our opinion, if one has enough assets to maintain existing lifestyle and meet necessary healthcare expenses, it will be wise to play safe and invest in less risky portfolio. However, the majority of this generation does not have this liberty due to lack of adequate savings.Therefore, they need to invest in assets, which can generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Obviously, baby boomers will never get that return by investing in bonds. So, which investment plan has the potential to generate regular returns and provide them the opportunity to accumulate assets for the future as well?Investment in Blue Chip Dividend Stocks is the Best ChoiceBlue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are unperturbed by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size as well.The companies’ dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.Our PicksWe have, thus, selected four blue chip dividend stocks for baby boomers that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), and have a dividend yield of more than 2%. The search was also narrowed down with a VGM score of A or B. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. All these four stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 index over the past decade.The first stock is one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies, KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of B and a dividend yield of 2.2%.Our next pick is also from the tech sector — Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report). The company sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of  A and a dividend yield of 2.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another stock is Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report), which designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel and natural gas engines, and engine-related component products worldwide.

332,CMI,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 28. Last quarter, the tire manufacturer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.46%. Plus, it has delivered the same in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.77%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company QuoteFactors at PlayGoodyear is investing in projects having a high rate of return. Recently, it has invested $485 million to expand its tire factory in Pulandian, Dalian, China. The expansion, scheduled to complete in 2020, will increase the plant’s capacity by about 5 million tires per annum. It will help Goodyear in meeting the growing demand for premium, large-rim-diameter consumer tires in China and the Asia Pacific region.The company is trying to boost its shareholder value, strengthen the balance sheet and restructure its senior debt. It is also launching innovative products and services to boost sales.However, Goodyear faces pricing pressure from OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer). This will likely create a negative impact on the company’s profit margins as it sells about 30% of its tires to OEMs. Also, it anticipates a total segment operating income for 2017 to be approximately $2 billion, consistent with the 2016 level. Results will be adversely affected due to weaker demand and higher raw material costs.Earnings Whispers                                      Our proven model does not conclusively show that Goodyear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Goodyear’s Earnings ESP is -13.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of 65 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goodyear carries a Zacks Rank #3.

333,CMI,"Robust growth in earnings is always welcome. This provides tremendous impetus to a stock and increases investors’ confidence. Usually, earnings growth leads to price appreciation, which ensures more gains for investors.That said, let’s take a look at the auto stocks that are slated to report results in the next couple of weeks. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Jul 19, 54 S&P 500 companies have already declared their results. These companies have posted 11.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and a 5.5% rise in revenues. However, as of the same date, 10% of the companies from the Auto, Tires and Trucks sector have reported results with a year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues of -7.5% and -5.6%, respectively.Second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth rates for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register -10.3% and -0.8% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, the S&P 500 companies are overall anticipated to record 7.2% and 4.5% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, during the quarter.In fact, year to date, the Auto, Tires and Trucks sector recorded a 6.4% compared with the S&P 500’s return of 10.7%.Auto Stocks: Speed BumpsOf late, auto makers have been encountering myriad challenges, which in turn might hamper their performances in 2017 too. Problems of high inventory levels and vehicle recalls are eating into the profits of auto companies.Auto behemoth, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) lowered the U.S. sales outlook for new vehicles in 2017. This paints a bleak picture for the industry in 2017.Added to this, the U.S. government’s plans to exit North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and implementation of a border-tax system have dulled the prospects of the auto stocks. This would increase the cost of U.S. cars and threaten jobs of thousands of suppliers.The Zacks MethodologyDespite the bleak auto sector outlook, there are some bright spots too. Some auto stocks are likely to record positive earnings surprise in the forthcoming results.Figuring out such prospective stocks could be quite tough unless one applies the proper method. The Zacks methodology makes the task simple, by combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.4 Auto PicksHere are four auto stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release their fourth-quarter results:Cummins Inc.

Price and EPS Surprise PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PACCAR Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PACCAR is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PACCAR is +2.04% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1 is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of an earnings beat. Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsPACCAR benefits from a sizeable market share in the U.S. and Canada. Also, the company undertakes active capital deployment. It has achieved Class 8 retail market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada in 2015 and 28.5% in 2016. Additionally, the above 16-ton market share increased to 15.5% in 2016, from 14.6% in 2015.PACCAR is well-positioned in key markets due to its strategic investments. For 2017, the company targets capital investments in the range of $375–$425 million besides research and development expenses of $250–$280 million.The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers (PDC). PACCAR is optimistic about its expansion plans in South America and Russia. The DAF factory in Ponta Grossa and the establishment of a subsidiary named DAF Trucks in Russia are expected to boost earnings.The company also opened a new distribution center in Renton, WA, in Apr 2016 to support the rising demand for its TRP branded parts. Further, it is expanding the 35-year old truck factory in Denton, TX and adding a new automated storage system for painted components.

335,CMI,"General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 25. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.24%.In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise, with an annual average beat of 17.83%. Also, the long-term expected earnings growth for the company (three to five years) is currently pegged at 9.23%.General Motors’ shares have returned 4.6% year to date, underperforming the 13.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.General Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise General Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise | General Motors Company QuoteFactors Influencing this QuarterIn 2017, General Motors expects weak used-car pricing, a tough pricing environment in the U.S. and China as well as more pressure on commodity costs. Additionally, the automaker has been experiencing a high inventory level of passenger cars. It is working toward bringing the inventory down by cutting down on production.In fact, General Motors has lowered the U.S. sales outlook for new vehicle sales in 2017. This indicates that the industry might be heading toward an average downslide in 2017. A decline in new vehicle volume will also lead to a dip in company’s total sales.Also, the company has been forced to scale down or shut its manufacturing operations in a few regions due to production constraints such as high costs and unfavorable currency translation effects. Moreover, General Motors’ decision to undertake a wide range of restructuring initiatives globally, such as stopping sale of cars in India, sale of its South African business and streamlining its Singapore office, are likely to result into charges of $500 million in second-quarter 2017. Of this, $200 million is likely to be a cash charge.Earnings Whispers                                      Our proven model does not conclusively show that General Motors is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

336,CMI,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings after the markets close on Jul 26. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in one of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 2.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterO’Reilly’s stores are concentrated in certain locations in the U.S. Thus, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. The company’s strategy of lowering the time-to-market for its products to meet the demand in the professional installer market, places it at a logistical disadvantage against competitors.Additionally, much of O’Reilly’s cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales. Further, the company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2017 from 2016 on rising costs.However, for second-quarter 2017, O’Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $3.10–$3.20, compared with $2.65, recorded in second-quarter 2016. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3–5%. For full-year 2017, it expects earnings per share in the band of $12.05–$12.15, higher than $10.73 earned in 2016.O’Reilly projects a consolidated comparable store sales increase in the 3%–5% range, during the year. The company anticipates revenues in the band of $9.1–$9.3 billion, higher than $8.59 billion, recorded in 2016.Earnings Whispers                               Our proven model does not conclusively show that O’Reilly is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

364,CMI,"Last week I wrote about a screen that helped me identify the best-performing sectors during the recent market sell-off. 
"
365,CMI,"I was using the Relative % Price Change over the last four weeks. The idea was that the sector(s) that showed the greatest resiliency should be the one(s) that breakout first. 
"
366,CMI,"This week Im using the Zacks Rank to help me find the best Industries. 
"
367,CMI,"As you know, the Zacks Rank is one of the best ways to find stocks to outperform. 
"
368,CMI,"Since an Industry is nothing more that a group of stocks in the same business, finding those groups with the best average Zacks Rank will help you pick stocks that should outperform. 
"
369,CMI,"This screen adds a unique tie-breaking element as well.  Parameters 
"
370,CMI,"Screening for the Best Industries based on the Zacks Rank is actually quite easy. 
"
371,CMI,"Youll set it up in the Calculation Expression feature and it will look like this: 
"
372,CMI,"GrAgg117A(1*i192) 
"
373,CMI,"Then choose the Operator:  BotXIndA#  3 
"
374,CMI,"All that means is were looking for the X Industries (Expanded Industries) with the Best Average Zacks Rank. 
"
375,CMI,"By saying Bottom 3, were looking for only the Best Three Industries. (Since a Zacks #1 Rank is better than a Zacks #5 Rank, we use the Bottom operator since the number 1 is smaller that the number 5.) 
"
376,CMI,"The Best Three X Industries this week (9/4/07) were:  Engines - Int Combustion     --  Average Zacks Rank of 1  Photo Equipment and Supplies --  Average Zacks Rank of 1.33  Fertilizers                  --  Average Zacks Rank of 1.50 (Feel free to expand your search to the best five or ten or however many industries you choose.) 
"
377,CMI,"Next its time to narrow down those Industries and find their best stocks. 
"
378,CMI,"Heres where the unique tie-breaker comes in. 
"
379,CMI,"If I search for the best two stocks in each Industry based on the Zacks Rank, there may be many stocks that have a Zacks #1 Rank. 
"
380,CMI,"Since the Zacks Rank is an integer (whole number), youll need a way to break a potential tie. 
"
381,CMI,"One way is to multiply the Zacks Rank with another item such as the Price to Sales Ratio or the P/E ratio. 
"
382,CMI,"Since Im looking for the best (or smallest) Zacks Rank, Ill multiply it by a number where the smaller it is the better. 
"
383,CMI,"So I multiply the Zacks #1 Rank by a P/E ratio  the stock with a 1 and the lower P/E ratio will be chosen. Why? Because 1 X 18 = 18 whereas 1 X 32.6 = 32.6. 
"
384,CMI,"The Zacks Rank with the smaller multiplier will be selected. This works equally well with other items. As I mentioned earlier  Price to Sales, Price to Book etc. 
"
385,CMI,"But since youre looking for a small number  dont multiply the Zacks Rank by a growth rate for example or an item where the bigger number is better. 
"
386,CMI,"Why?  Because a Zacks #1 Rank multiplied by a growth rate of 100% is bigger than a Zacks #1 Rank multiplied by a growth rate of 25%. So the result will be 100 vs. 25. But this will result in you getting the Zacks #1 with the lower growth rate  probably not what you intended. 
"
387,CMI,"So multiply it by an item where the lower number is considered best. 
"
388,CMI,"The Zacks Rank x the P/E ratio would look like this in the Calculation Expression feature. 
"
389,CMI,"i192 * i76 
"
390,CMI,"Then youd select the operator:  Bot#InXInd  2 
"
391,CMI,"Again  the bottom number in this example would be the best. 
"
392,CMI,"Here is one stock from each of the Best 3 Industries:  Engines - Int Combustion  --  Average Zacks Rank of 1 
"
393,CMI,"Best stock: (CMI  -  Free Report)(Cummins) -- value of 16.66 Photo Equipment and Supplies  --  Average Zacks Rank of 1.33 
"
394,CMI,"Best stock: EK(Eastman Kodak)  -- value of 21.17 Fertilizers  --  Average Zacks Rank of 1.50 
"
395,CMI,"Best stock: AGU(Agrium)  --  value of 21.79 Note: when the Zacks Rank is 1 = the best stock will be decided by which multiplier is the lowest. 
"
396,CMI,"But if youre comparing Zacks #1 Ranks and Zacks #2 Ranks  for example: if the Zacks #1 Rank has a higher enough multiplier than the Zacks #2 Rank, you may find that the Zacks #2 Rank gets picked instead. 
"
397,CMI,"Try experimenting with different multipliers on your own and see which works best for you. And dont forget to backtest it! 
"
398,CMI,"Many screeners wont let you screen for the Top Sectors or Industries.

424,CMI,"In just the last decade, the automotive industry has drastically changed, in ways that we likely haven’t really noticed. Companies like Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) are redefining what it means to own a luxury vehicle, while Silicon Valley tech giants like Uber have not only helped create a new industry—ride-hailing—but it is also (controversially) working to further the development of self-driving vehicles.And Uber isn’t just the only one. There is, of course, its burgeoning arch-nemesis Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) with its own self-driving car unit, Waymo, in addition to the laundry list of traditional automakers like Ford (F  -  Free Report) hoping to debut this technology in the near future.While the dream of fully-functioning self-driving cars and other big technologies certainly loom both near and far, there are other facets of the auto industry that investors should make sure do not get lost in the shuffle. With this in mind, check out these three auto stocks to buy now.Paccar Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Paccar designs and manufactures premium light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks. Its Truck segment operates under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF nameplates, while its Parts division includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Mexico and South America.Right now, Paccar is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and shares have risen about 70% this year. For the current quarter, the truck manufacturer expects earnings growth of 33.7%--seven analysts have revised their estimates upwards in the past 30 days—and long-term EPS growth of 10%. Paccar also sits in a strong industry; Automotive-Domestic is in the top 20% of the Zacks Industry Rank.Paccar’s value metrics look good, and has a forward P/E of 16.86. While PCAR is more expensive compared to its broader industry’s price-to-earnings, the stock has traded below the S&P 500 since the end of March.Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report)Together with its subsidiaries, Cummins designs and distributes diesel and natural gas engines, and engine-related component products worldwide. The company operates through its Engine, Distribution, Components, and Power Systems segments. Cummins is based in Columbus, IN.A #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, shares of Cummins have returned about 25% so far in 2017. Current quarter estimates show earnings growing nearly 16% year-over-year, and six analysts have revised their estimates upwards. Over the long-term, the company expects EPS to rise about 12.1%. Like Paccar, Cummins is in a very strong industry; Automotive-Internal Combustion Enginesis in the top 4% of the Zacks Industry Rank.With a forward P/E of just about 17, CMI’s valuation is in-line with its industry average, though it has traded below the S&P 500 since the end of April. The company’s price-to-sales is 1.47, while its PEG ratio is 1.4, two metrics that are also on par with the industry.AB Volvo (VLVLY  -  Free Report)AB Volvo is the parent company of Volvo Group, and it manufactures trucks, buses, construction equipment, diesel engines, and marine and industrial engines; it also provides solutions for financing and service.

The company is also in a well-performing industry, and Automotive-Original Equipment sits in the top 16% if the Zacks Industry Rank.VLVLY is a relatively cheap stock, with a forward P/E of 15.9.

427,CMI,"On Nov 6, we issued an updated research report on LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report).On Oct 26, LKQ Corp. reported earnings per share of 45 cents for third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 30, 2017), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. Revenues improved 11.7% year over year to $2.47 billion. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37 billion.For the fiscal-end, LKQ Corp. expects organic revenue growth for parts & services in the range of 4-4.5% compared with the prior guidance of 4-4.25%. Adjusted income from continuing operations is likely to be in the band of $575-$595 million, up from the prior expectation of $570-$595 million. Adjusted earnings per share in 2017 are expected in the band of $1.86-$1.92, up from the former projection of $1.84-$1.92.LKQ Corporation Price and Consensus LKQ Corporation Price and Consensus | LKQ Corporation QuoteIts repair products catering to the automotive aftermarket makes it less exposed to the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. Also, with the growing used-vehicles market and an increase in the average age of automobiles in the United States, the company might witness a rise in demand for its repair products.LKQ Corp. has also been making frequent acquisitions to expand its presence. During the third quarter, it acquired 11 companies, including two in the United States and nine in Europe. Apart from acquisitions, the company has been opening new ECP branches for counter sales and distribution centers in Europe.However, these acquisitions are weighing on LKQ Corp.’s gross margin. For instance, the buyout of Rhiag and PGW has lowered gross margins, which sees a massive drop from the historical levels the company once reached.

The company projects revenues to grow 9-11%, whereas the prior guidance was 4-6%.Revenues from the Components segment are expected to increase 6-10% due to stronger-than-anticipated demand in the China truck market and improved outlook for the North American heavy- and medium-duty truck market.At the Distribution segment, revenues for 2017 are expected to rise 4-6%, up from the prior guidance of flat to 4% increase. For 2017, the Power Systems segment revenues are projected to increase 1-5%, up from the previous guidance of flat to down 4%. The raised guidance can be attributed to increased customer demand from mining, and oil and gas engines in addition to higher parts sales.For the Engine segment, the company expects revenues to be up 2-6%, up from the previous guidance of down 3-6% due to improved outlook in most of the markets.Net sales from the Components segment came in at $1.45 in second-quarter 2017.

444,CMI,"Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) soared to a new all-time high on Tuesday after the company reported better than expected third-quarter results and upbeat fourth-quarter guidance, pulling much of the construction and equipment industry—including Thor Industries (THO  -  Free Report) and United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report)—up as well.Caterpillar topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues. The company’s revenues jumped 25% from the year-ago period to $11.41 billion, while earnings crushed expectations and skyrocketed year-over-year (also read: Caterpillar's (CAT  -  Free Report) Cost Discipline Drives Q3 Earnings Beat).On top of that, the Peoria, Illinois-based company upped its full-year guidance. Caterpillar now expects to post revenues of $44 billion, up from a previous range of between $42 and $44 billion. This comes as welcome news to shareholders and potential investors, as the manufacturing powerhouse reported revenues of $38.54 billion last year, which marked its fourth consecutive year of declining sales.Caterpillar grew revenues and bolstered its bottom line in its third-quarter thanks to sales growth from all three of its business sectors, as well as a commitment to cutting costs. The company’s three main businesses—Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation— all experienced revenue growth in every global region Caterpillar operates in.The company cited gains in its construction-related businesses in China, along with onshore oil and gas in North American, as well as an overall jump in capital investments from mining companies, as some of the biggest reasons for the jump in revenue.“Higher sales volume and our team’s focus on cost discipline resulted in improved profit margins across our three primary segments,” Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said in a statement.In terms of earnings guidance, Caterpillar raised its projection from around $5 per share to $6.25 per share. What’s more, the manufacturing equipment power announced it would also raise prices early next year.Caterpillar’s shares popped over 7% in early morning trading to touch a new all-time intraday trading high of $140.44 per share. Since then, the stock has cooled off a bit and now hovers around 4.5% above Monday’s closing price.Shares of other construction, mining machinery, and manufacturing companies gained on the back of Caterpillar’s big quarterly beats and upbeat in full-year guidance.Other Stocks Caterpillar’s rise helped renew investors’ confidence, which led some infrastructure ETFs to pop. Shares of the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Const ETF (PKB  -  Free Report) and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) both jumped nearly 1.0%, while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) experienced marginal gains.Other infrastructure, mining, and manufacturing companies also experienced gains on Tuesday. Shares of Thor Industries climbed over 1.30%, while United Rentals stock popped by over 2.20%. Gibraltar Industries (ROCK  -  Free Report), Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report), and Deere & Company (DE) stock all gained as well.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterIn the third quarter of 2017, the motor company expects to dispatch around 39,000-44,000 motorcycles, representing a decline of 10-20% from the year-ago period. Also, stiff competition and huge price discounting might hit Harley-Davidson’s retail sales.Additionally, Harley-Davidson will be paying $15 million as settlement charges to the Environmental Protection Agency due to its super tuners releasing harmful emissions despite power generation.

With these initiatives, the company expects to achieve positive growth in overseas retail sales in the second half of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Harley-Davidson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Harley-Davidson has an Earnings ESP of -4.45% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 39 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. A positive ESP on the other hand, serves as an indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and chances of an earnings beat. However, combined with a negative Earnings ESP, surprise prediction becomes inconclusive.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Price PerformanceShares of Harley-Davidson have declined 20.3% year to date, substantially underperforming the industry’s 26.7% rally.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks worth considering from the Auto industry as per our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Magna International, Inc.

457,CMI,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) has deferred the unveiling of its semi-truck, Tesla Semi, to Nov 16, per an Autoblog report. This is the second time that the automaker has rescheduled the unveiling of the truck. The company’s increased focus on mending production problems linked to Model 3 and raise battery production for hurricane-affected Puerto Rico, can be attributed to this delay.Notably, the Palo Alto, CA-based automaker has fallen short of its third-quarter 2017 production target of the new Model 3 sedan. During the quarter, the company delivered 220 Model 3s and produced 260, missing the production target of 1,500. This indicates that production has not been as smooth as anticipated. Importantly, the Model 3 could catapult Tesla to become a mass market producer. However, Tesla reported that production bottlenecks came in the way of ramping-up production of Model 3 (read more: Tesla Fails to Meet Production Target of Model 3).Per Wall Street Journal, parts of Model 3 were being manufactured by hand. In fact, production of the advanced assembly line, promised by Tesla, is yet to be ready, hampering its production target badly. Moreover, not only the Model 3 production but also the quality of the vehicles will also play a significant role in Tesla’s success.In the last six months, Tesla’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to. Shares of the company have increased 14.3%, while the industry has grown 15.7%.Currently, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), Cummins Inc.

459,CMI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Cummins has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.7. This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.5.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Cummins’ current PE above its median over the observed period (which stands at 15.5x), with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. Hence, we could infer that the stock is slightly overvalued in this respect, especially in light of its historical trend.Further, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Auto sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.Nevertheless, we should also point out that Cummins has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 17.3 – lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a more value-oriented path may be ahead for Cummins stock in the near term.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Cummins has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is higher than the Zacks Auto sector average, which comes in at 0.7x right now too.CMI is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Cummins currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Cummins an apt choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Cummins might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives CMI a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending upward lately. The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen 10 upward revisions and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Cummins Inc. Price and Consensus Cummins Inc. Price and Consensus | Cummins Inc. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineCummins is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. It forms a part of the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry which ranks among the Top 42% out of more than 250 Zacks classified industries.In fact, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market over the past year, as you can see below:Moving ahead, Cummins expects to witness a growing trend in its truck and construction products’ demand, along with growth in global mining customers, which will have a positive impact on its sales figure. The company is also developing a Class 7 heavy-duty electric truck having a 140 kWh battery pack, to cater bus and commercial truck operators. Additionally, Cummins is poised to benefit from its business expansions in China and acquisitions and partnerships in North America.However, challenging market conditions, currency headwinds and high warranty costs might dent the financials of Cummins.So, value investors might want to wait for the company’s price to correct downwards a bit first before taking a position in the name. But, once that happens, the stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.
