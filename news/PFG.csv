16,PFG,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

17,PFG,"Passive management and index funds are the biggest challenges facing the active asset management industry, according to top executives at Principal Financial Group.Principal (PFG) Chairman and CEO Dan Houston and Jim McCaughan, president and chief executive officer of Principal Global Investors, expressed their views in New York while presenting the company's year-end review and long-term strategy to analysts, clients and investors.In a separate wide-ranging interview with Investor's Business Daily, the pair covered the state of the asset management business today, the rise of passive management and index funds, the fate of the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule and the future of the market in the wake of Donald Trump's election.The challenge presented by passive management and index funds come as investors wake up to the size of management fees, McCaughan said. He oversees all of the Des Moines, Iowa-based financial services company's asset management activities, which included $397 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.""The industry is seeing strong headwinds adversely affect the pricing on core active strategies with the moves to passive management,"" McCaughan said. ""You have horrible pricing pressure. And most investment managers are seeing declining revenues. It's become a very tough environment.""McCaughan said the main technology influences that contributed to the recent rise of index funds happened a decade ago: The New Market Systems regulation, or Reg NMS, and the Security and Exchange Commission's Financial Disclosure regulation, or Reg FD. These disrupted trading and the price discovery mechanisms for securities.""By making price discovery more immediate and transparent, you no longer have time to react to the news like you did 15 year ago,"" said McCaughan. No one has a chance to know anything before anyone else, and that is why active core strategies are less rewarding.IBD'S TAKE: Principal Financial Group is ranked third within the Insurance-Diversified group by IBD Stock Checkup. Go to Stock Checkup to see what other stocks in the group are highly ranked.Despite the headwinds, Principal's assets are up 9% so far this year because of a number of strategic moves, said McCaughan. He said his company hasn't seen the price erosion others have experienced because Principal's managers are focused on less efficient markets where better research can help them differentiate themselves from the indexes and their competition.He pointed to areas such as high-yield bonds, real estate investment trusts, emerging-market debt, investment-grade credit, even small- and midcap stocks. He said by moving into niche areas that are less liquid and less researched, it's possible to provide returns that investors are willing to pay a higher price for.But Principal is also counteracting the trend to passive by putting strategies together in what it calls outcome-oriented funds. These include target-date funds and target-risk funds. Target-risk funds are multi-asset funds with five ""flavors"" of risk from aggressive to conservative that advisors can use to provide a risk profile for a client.McCaughan said Principal has put this idea of a multistrategy income fund using global bond and equity markets into an active ETF, Principal EDGE Active Income ETF (YLD). After about 18 months, YLD has $270 million in assets. Trading so far is light, about 1,000 shares a day. But the ETF is up nearly 12% this year and yields 4%. Its expense ratio is 0.96%.""We believe the opportunity in the specialty assets and the multi-asset strategies will have a sustainable advantage for clients,"" said McCaughan. ""And if we are a leader in those areas, they will be rewarding for the clients and for us.""Another topic of concern for the industry is the implementation of the DOL's fiduciary rule, which is to be phased in next April.Houston said he doesn't expect the rule to be repealed, but that the implementation could be delayed.With advisors being paid by either a commission or fee structure, the new rule says advisors using commissions would need to provide clients with a disclosure called a BICE (best interest contract exemption).""I would hope we would see better clarity and avoid creating a massive class action lawsuit environment, primarily related to the BICE,"" said Houston. ""We think some help around the language related to the commission could provide serious benefits to consumers, starting with lower fees. ""He said there may be account holders where the fee structure is not as beneficial as a commission structure. Especially for clients who don't trade often.""There's all the reason in the world to have good fee disclosure to the consumer,"" Houston said. ""It should be very transparent and easy to understand. 'What am I getting for those fees?' The industry, broadly defined, supports that 100%. How you get there is the conversation that will take place in the ensuing months and years.""Looking forward, McCaughan said from an optimistic economic point of view you can anticipate reduced tax rates, fiscal stimulus from infrastructure and deregulation. This could lead to economic growth of 2% to 4%.""The question is does the economy have the capacity to growth that fast? We don't know, "" said McCaughan. ""Does unemployment of 4.9% mean that we're at capacity constraints in the economy? If that's true, then the boom would be short lived.""However, if the extra growth were to bring in new capacity, in particular workers currently outside the labor force, then this could start a period of sustained economic growth.On the negative side, if the new administration imposes tariffs on imports and deports undocumented residents, this could escalate social tensions, leading to a drop in consumer confidence. This could lead to a recession sometime late next year into 2018, said McCaughan.""But, don't underestimate the strength and innovation in the U.S. private sectors,"" said McCaughan. ""I am prepared to say continue to buy U.S. equities on setbacks. Keep asset allocations up to weight, focus on domestic earnings, which take you to small- and midcap stocks. Those would be my biggest points. On bond yields, don't play a yield game. Don't be out there on duration. Go for shorter duration higher-yielding bonds. My favorites are real estate bonds and high-yield bonds. A lot is pointing to the U.S. being the best place for capital over the next 12 months.""RELATED:DOL Fiduciary Rule Forces Investors To Weigh Their OptionsHow Much Is A Financial Advisor's Services Really Worth?

19,PFG,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base. Spectra Energy (SE), International Paper (IP) and Enbridge (ENB) are all four weeks into flat consolidations, which point to more possible bases maturing the week beginning October 17.Rising Optimism Among This Insurer's Clients Bode Well For Its StockCummins' Triple Threat: Dividend Growth, Cash Flow And Big Price GainsBank Stocks Have Work To Do, But Could Be Worth WatchingCisco Systems Spending $4 Billion In Mexico

Trades were booked Tuesday for settlement purposes.In terms of technical analysis, the relative strength index for WTI started the session above the 70-point threshold that shows prices may have risen too quickly. It slipped below 70 as the market moved lower in late trading.""The relative strength index is chopping around 70 since May 24, which suggests that the rally is overdone,"" said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York.Brent for July settlement, which expired Tuesday, slipped 7 cents to $49.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices capped a fourth monthly increase, also the longest streak since 2011. The global benchmark closed at a 59-cent premium to WTI.

21,PFG,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

34,PFG,"Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report) remains well-poised for growth, banking on strong segmental performance, growing assets under management (AUM) and a solid capital position. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) investment manager bears immense potential owing to a few good growth drivers.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share is pegged at $5.61 on revenues of $13.84. The consensus mark reflects a year-over-year increase of 7.5% for the bottom line and nearly 1% for the top line.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 10%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Principal Financial has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.40%.The company is expected to report fourth-quarter results in the last week of January. Our proven model shows that Principal Financial is likely to beat estimates this quarter based on an ideal combination of the two strong ingredients: a Zacks Rank of 2, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.98%, which makes us confident of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Upbeat Guidance: Principal International is expected to deliver net revenue growth between 11% and 14% in 2018. While solid sales and retention as well as an employment recovery are likely to drive Specialty Benefits premiums and fees by 7-9%, the loss ratio is estimated at 62-68% on improved underwriting. Premiums and fees at Individual Life are projected to increase in the band of 3-6%.Price Performance: Shares of Principal Financial have rallied 20.2% in a year’s time, substantially underperforming the industry’s 30% surge. Nonetheless, the shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index’s 19% registered gain. Underpriced: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio — the best multiple for valuing investment managers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — shares are underpriced at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.68, falling significantly below the industry average of 2.54. In fact undervalued shares with growth prospects are the best investment bets. Principal Financial carries a Value Score of A.  Growth Drivers in PlacePrincipal Financial’s businesses across most lines and segments are poised to deliver solid numbers. The company estimates net revenue growth in the range of 2-5% at Retirement and Income Solutions — Fees and 5-10% at Retirement and Income Solutions — Spread. Revenues are estimated to increase 4-8% at Principal Global Investors.Principal Financial’s AUM shows a steadily rising trend, driven by better results at three asset management and asset accumulation segments. We believe this AUM growth to be supported by the company’s extensive distribution footprint, best-in-class solutions and an operational discipline. Principal Financial envisions $1 trillion in assets under management on the strength of various growth drivers and its strong leadership position.The gradually improving rate environment will continue to drive better investment results.A robust financial position aids the company to return value to shareholders through dividend hikes as well as pursue growth initiatives. While the company targets capital deployment between $0.9 and $1.3 billion in 2018, it estimates risk-based capital ratio to return to the targeted range of 415-425% over the next several quarters.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in investment managers can look at are Legg Mason, Inc.

Nonetheless, the growth rate is forecast to remain between 9% and 12% over the long term.Over the past few years, the company has set aside capital for deployment in either strategic acquisitions or for enhancing shareholders’ value. In 2018, the company intends to utilize $0.9-$1.3 billion for quarterly dividends, strategic acquisitions and share buybacks as well as to deleverage its balance sheet. This is above the expected capital deployment of $0.8-$1 billion for 2017. Of this, the company already returned $604.5 million to shareholders through the first three quarters of 2017.  Management intends to use 65-70% of the net income for capital deployment over the long term.Principal Financial expects shares outstanding of 290-292 million at year-end 2018.The company intends to focus more on strategic opportunities in the growing asset accumulation and asset management businesses. Also, it is well-positioned on the back of an extensive distribution footprint, best-in-class solutions and operational discipline. Deeper focus on fee-based revenue sources has been helping the company earn steadily and limit exposure to the adverse interest rate environment. We believe that these attributes will help it meet its expectations going forward.Quarter to date, the Principal Financial stock has gained 10%, surpassing the 6% growth of its industry. The company has not witnessed any earnings momentum in the last 30 days. With the new view instilling confidence in the company’s operational performance, we expect analysts to raise their estimates.

38,PFG,"The performance of the investment management/brokerage industry (part of the broader Finance sector) has been impressive over the past several quarters. Rising interest rates also continue to benefit the industry. Further, majority of the investment managers have stopped waiving off their fees as interest rates gradually improve. This is likely to aid top-line growth.Performance of equity markets remained strong in the July-September quarter. The S&P 500 Index gained 4.5% in the quarter and the index measuring international equity performance — the MSCI EAFE — climbed roughly 5%. This resulted in asset inflows and a rise in assets under management (AUM). Thus, the related fees might also witness an increase, thereby supporting revenue growth.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the investment management/brokerage industry in the quarter are expected to grow 8% year over year. This compares unfavorably with the prior-quarter growth of 8.6%.Now, let’s take a look at some of the investment management stocks are that scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.Franklin Resources Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.64 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.However, the company is expected to show a slight increase in operating expenses as it continues to enhance its technological reach. Overall, earnings are projected to decline year over year.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. Let’s see what it has in store for this soon-to-be reported quarter.Given a gradually improving interest rate environment, the investment income, indicating a major component to the top line, has likely improved.  The company’s fee-based revenue sources coupled with improved investment income likely have driven increased revenues.

40,PFG,"President Trump’s plans of massive tax cuts and reforms cleared a critical hurdle with the Senate passing a budget blueprint of trillions of dollars for fiscal 2018. This has paved the way for the Republicans to pursue the much awaited tax-cut reform without Democratic support. After all, both American households and corporates have borne the burden of an unfair tax code for quite some time.The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates will put more money in individual’s pockets, while it will be a shot in the arm for financial as well as tech majors that have parked a lot of cash overseas. The cash held overseas will be brought back to avail the lower domestic rate, prompting a slew of new deals. This in turn will fuel innovation, organic growth and earnings.Repatriation of billions of dollars also strengthens the economy causing the federal funds rate to move north, which bodes well for both banking and non-banking financial organizations. Thus, let us invest in multinational financial and information technology service providers, as well as computer makers that can make the most from the lowering of corporate tax rate.Senate Republicans Push Through Budget ProposalSenate Republicans successfully passed a $4-trillion budget blueprint in federal outlays by a 51-to-49 vote. The Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget measure, with GOP senator Rand Paul of Kentucky voting against it. This has set the stage for Republicans to begin ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code as early as this year, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses globally more competitive.After repeatedly failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, the GOP lawmakers were under tremendous pressure to deliver on tax reforms that they had promised in the election campaign. The Senate’s passage of the budget blueprint has unlocked a special parliamentary procedure that will help Republicans cut $1.5 trillion in taxes with just 50 votes. A typical Senate procedure requires 60 votes to bypass the threat of a filibuster.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell supported the budget and said that it was “critical to getting tax reform done;” while President Trump added that it is “an important step in advancing the Administration’s pro-growth and pro-jobs legislative agenda.”President Trump, in the meantime, had a tough message for House Republicans. They need to work on the tax reform and pass the Senate’s budget this week or face bloodbath next year. House Speaker Paul Ryan had already told his members that he wants tax reform enacted by this year, and approving the revised Senate budget this week gives the best shot to get it done within that timeframe.Banks Set to Gain From Trump’s Sweeping Tax CutsIt’s no wonder that bank’s profitability will be enhanced by the proposed tax cuts. The corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%.The slashing of domestic tax rate will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This will, ultimately, boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Non-banking financial institutions including insurance companies, asset managers and brokerage firms should also benefit. Rising rates act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should gain from a higher rate environment.Brokerage firms and asset managers also advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions From Trump’s Tax Plan Tax cuts will make tech majors bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will encourage such companies to carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Oracle Corporation hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.Top 5 GainersBanking on such positives, investing in sound multinational companies from the aforesaid sectors will be a prudent choice.

43,PFG,"As a property and casualty (P&C) insurer, W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) is exposed to both natural and man-made catastrophe events. The company has also been incurring inclement weather-related losses over a considerable period of time. With the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in Mexico, the company anticipates its underwriting results to get hurt in the near term. To that end, it has given a catastrophe loss projection of about $110 million, translating to $72 million after-tax.It is important to note that being a P&C insurer, W.R. Berkley cannot avoid the aftermath of such catastrophe events, which in turn poses a threat to weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-oriented calamities inevitably makes its earnings volatile.This apart, intense competition in the global reinsurance segment has resulted in downward pressure on rates for the near term, thus restricting growth. Therefore, the company anticipates the increasing competition to negatively impact reinsurance results in the short term, leading to an earnings decline and hurting the company’s overall performance in the process.Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) P&C insurer’s unfavorable gross premiums trend has been a dampener over the past few years with the company not even expecting to bounce back anytime soon. The company has also been persistently experiencing rising expenses, which might hamper its operations and limit growth.Southbound Estimates: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 13.3% downward over the last 60 days. While the same for 2018 has slipped nearly 1.5% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank as well.An Underperformer: Shares of W.R. Berkley have gained 1.2% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 12.5% rally. We expect substantial catastrophe losses, declining gross premiums as well as unfavorable global reinsurance results to throw challenges at the company’s overall functioning.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third-quarter results on Oct 24, 2017. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this time around. This is because it needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. But that is not the case here as W.R. Berkley currently has a Zacks Rank #4 that lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP  of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Also, the company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector include Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

44,PFG,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to the growing demands and expectations of its clients for years, building a solid product and service portfolio over time. Retaining this optimism, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) multi-line insurer continues to evolve stronger and looks set to repeat the success streak in the near future.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $10.09 on revenues of $52.10 billion for 2017. Although the top line reflects a year-over-year slip of 0.3%, the bottom line improves 10.6%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $11.22 on $54.16 billion revenues. While earnings represent an 11.2% increase, revenues reflect a 3.9% rise.  Prudential Financial has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Northbound Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has inched up 0.1% in the last 60 days, while the same for 2018 has nudged up 0.2% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank.An Outperformer: Shares of Prudential Financial have surged 29.3% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 21.8% rally. We expect the company’s sustained operational performance, improving asset under management and a robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Attractive Valuation: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.9, falling significantly below the industry average of 1.4. Also, the stock carries Value Score of A. Back-tested results have shown stocks with Value Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 are best investment bets.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third quarter results on Nov 1, 2017. Our proven model conclusively shows that it is likely to beat on earnings this time around as the company has a favorable Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.74%. Prudential has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.Growth DriversThe insurer will continue to benefit from its massive reach and an in-depth expertise in the pension risk transfer (PRT) business. The company is also on track to establish a leadership position in the potentially strong PRT market, suitable to mobilize the insurance company’s skills in the management of group annuity.Interestingly, the company arrived at a decision to realign U.S. businesses to position itself better to leverage business mix and capture the long-term growth opportunities within and across domestic businesses.The company’s international operations too have placed it well for long-term growth. It is expected to gain from the AFP Habitat buyout, completed in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction, expanding its international footprint, is estimated to result in a stable rise, steady earnings and an adequate cash flow generation. Therefore, the organization remains focused on diversifying activities to enable it to accelerate overall growth and keep up the streak in the immediate term as well.  Additionally, Prudential has prosperously generated investors’ value. It has been approved to buy back worth $1.25 billion shares in 2017. The company remains committed toward maintaining a solid capital and liquidity status, thus protecting itself from market volatility.Near-Term Headwinds: However, an unfavorable currency impact and regulatory control remain challenges to tide over. In addition, rising expenses have been spoilers for the insurer and that does not expect a turnaround anytime soon.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry are Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying the same bullish Zacks Rank of 2.

45,PFG,"The Zacks investment management industry, part of the broader Finance sector, performed decently over the past several quarters. However, the trend seems to have picked up pace to some extent in the first quarter on the back of improved domestic growth environment.The companies that have reported first-quarter 2018 earnings so far witnessed growth in their trading revenues due to increased volatility in the quarter. However, dismal overall investment banking activities remained a drag.The Investment managers’ earnings are expected to get support from rising interest rates and lower tax. Also, the quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, along with President Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports. This led to increased volatility, which indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Apart from this, the global M&A activity increased in the quarter. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally rose during the quarter. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Hence, the related fees are projected to increase.However, debt underwriting remained disappointing as rising rates limit corporates’ involvement in  these activities. Thus, overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline. Also, increased spending in technology is expected to keep costs up, in turn, hurting the investment managers’ bottom line.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the finance sector are expected to grow 27% year over year on revenue growth of 5.4%.Now, let’s take a look at some of the investment management stocks that are scheduled to announce first-quarter results on Apr 26.Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report before the opening bell.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.6 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 0.86%.However, earnings are projected to rise year over year.

46,PFG,"Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 13.14%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterPrincipal Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by its fee-based revenue sources and an improved investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 15.5% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, the company’s bottom line is anticipated to have benefitted from better-than-expected performance at fee, spread and risk businesses. Also, share buybacks are likely to have cushioned the company’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share, reflecting a 6.3% rise from the year-ago quarter.Additionally, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, will aid the companies’ bottom line, thereby boosting margins directly.It is important to mention here that the company acknowledges the first quarter to be the lowest period for earnings attributable to dental and vision claims at Specialty Benefits plus the elevated payroll taxes at Principal Global Investors.Better performance in asset management and asset accumulation segments owing to core growth as well as strategic acquisitions are estimated to have improved assets under management.However, the company is likely to witness an increase in total expenses, primarily due to higher benefits, claims and settlement expenses as well as operating expenses. This in turn is expected to restrict the company’s desired operating margin expansion.Principal Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Principal Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Principal Financial Group, Inc. Quote What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Principal Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Principal Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.35. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Principal Financial carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 30.

48,PFG,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t stand the test of time. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.) You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,818 stocks to only 23. Among them, we have selected five large-cap stocks. Such stocks have long-term performance history and are more stable than what mid-caps or small caps offer. Companies with market capitalization of more than $10 billion are generally considered large cap.Here are the top five stocks:Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) is focused on building products that enable people to connect and share through mobile devices, personal computers and other surfaces. The company’s products include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. Facebook has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

49,PFG,"Price-to-earnings (P/E), without a shadow of a doubt, is the most popular metric used by investors to handpick stocks that are trading at a discount. A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase for stocks that have a low P/E ratio. However, even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings.EV/EBITDA is a Better Approach, But Why?While P/E enjoys huge popularity in the value investing world, a more complicated metric called EV/EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer image of a firm’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA, also referred to as enterprise multiple, determines the total value of a firm while P/E just considers its equity portion.EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, is a true reflection of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings.Usually, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Given this reason, EV/EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another downside of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. Moreover, a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV/EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positive.EV/EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV/EBITDA has its limitations too. It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV/EBITDA might not fetch the desired results. But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen:Synnex Corporation (SNX  -  Free Report) is a business process services company, providing a range of distribution, logistics and integration services for the technology industry.

51,PFG,"Backed by the improving rate scenario and President Trump’s policy goals, the year 2017 kicked off on an impressive note. Zacks Investment Management Industry (part of the broader Zacks Finance Sector) has been performing decently since then, following an upbeat performance last year.Industry ProspectsWith some monthly variability, both equity and fixed income recorded relatively steady inflows over the last several months. Despite the prevailing global concerns, the U.S. economy is witnessing steady improvement. This, combined with growing demand for personalized investment products, is anticipated to enhance the growth opportunities for the asset management industry.This is clearly evident from the industry’s 15.2% gain in six months’ time, as compared with just 10.3% gain of the S&P 500 Index.While asset managers have been facing a number of headwinds like stringent regulatory scrutiny, fee pressure and escalating costs, demand for new investment products at lower costs continue to support their bottom line. Further, with increased use of technology, asset managers have been able to enhance efficiency and operate profitably.Additionally, favorable equity markets and low volatility are supporting asset managers with increasing client investments. Moreover, rising interest rates are leading to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources is aiding revenue growth for investment managers.Weakness of the U.S. dollar is also driving the global diversified assets mix. Though active managers are striving hard over passive managers, they have recorded growth in asset classes including international small-cap equity and core fixed income.Overall, investment management companies will likely come up with a value proposition under which both performance and fee meet clients’ increasing demands.Industry Rank Indicates Upside PotentialThe current Zacks Industry Rank for investment management stocks shows significant upside potential.This 51-company industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #82, which places it at the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks Industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Studies have revealed that an average stock in a strong industry is likely to perform better than an exceptional stock in an industry that is out of favor with investors. Thus, the combination of top-rated industries and stocks will surely enhance your investment portfolio.Selecting the Winning StocksWe have handpicked some investment management stocks with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener. We have selected stocks which carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have expected long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of more than 5%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.To narrow down the list, we have picked stocks with positive earnings estimate revisions for the past 60 days.Here are five top-ranked stocks that meet the criteria:New York-based Cohen & Steers Inc (CNS  -  Free Report) is a publicly-owned asset management holding company providing services to institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments and foundations, globally.Zacks Rank: #2Expected EPS Growth (3-5 years): 6.1%Market Cap: $1.8 billionChange Current Year Estimate (8 weeks): 2.6%AllianceBernstein Holding L.P.

53,PFG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Principal Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.88, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.61. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Principal Financial’ current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 12.08) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Investment Management industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.27. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Principal Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.07, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Principal Financial stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Principal Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.58. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.20 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Principal Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PFG a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Principal Financial is just 1.42, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.44. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PFG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Principal Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘D’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives PFG a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Principal Financial Group Inc Price and Consensus  Principal Financial Group Inc Price and Consensus | Principal Financial Group Inc QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePrincipal Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, despite a decent industry rank (top 24% out of more than 250 industries), a Zacks Rank #3, makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Investment Management sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

54,PFG,"Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.55%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this Past QuarterPrincipal Financial’s revenues should have improved on the back of its fee-based model. Investment income, a major contributor to the top line, is likely to have increased owing to the gradually improving rate environment.Premium and fee are estimated to have increased in Individual Life and Specialty Benefits in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Solid performances at asset management and asset accumulation segments likely have fueled improvement in assets under management.Share buybacks should have boosted the bottom line.However, escalating expenses might have weighed on margin expansion.With respect to the surprise trend, Principal Financial delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.54%.The stock price has been fluctuating over the last few days. We wait to see how the stock fares post second-quarter earnings release.Principal Financial Group Inc Price and EPS Surprise Principal Financial Group Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Principal Financial Group Inc QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Principal Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Principal Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.22. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Principal Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked companies from the investment management industry that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter.Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Jul 28.

55,PFG,"North Korea testing its deadliest ballistic missile sent shockwaves through Wall Street, while drawing widespread rebuke from across the globe. As the U.S. Congress returns from its summer recess on Sep 5, the chances of a possible showdown with Silicon Valley and government shutdown are high.Investors are already dealing with the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey on the stock market. Add to this an overwhelming majority of fund managers seeing U.S. market as the most overvalued, and then a market correction seems inevitable in the near term. Also, September has typically recorded dismal stock returns over the past two decades.With the month expected to be rough, investing in sound dividend paying stocks seems judicious. Such stocks provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing.Markets Cautious After North Korea Nuclear TestThe situation with North Korea continues to be tense and uncertain. The nation conducted its largest nuclear test on Sep 4, when the U.S. markets observed Labor Day holiday. Pyongyang is also preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile.The United States warned that countries trading with North Korea were adding fuel to its “dangerous nuclear intentions”. At the United Nations Security Council meeting, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un was “begging for war.” He requested all the council members to levy tough new sanctions on the rogue nation. South Korea, in the meanwhile, is in talks with Washington to deploy aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the Korean peninsula. South Korea conducted long-range air-to-surface and ballistic missiles following North Korea’s nuclear test.Mmain U.S. stock index futures took a beating on Sep 4, with the Dow briefly trading as low as 103 points, as per Fact Set data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures also slipped to close in the negative territory.Tension in Silicon Valley, Possibilities of Government Shutdown LoomOn the domestic front, President Trump intends to end Obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals program. Almost 800,000 so-called Dreamers are staying in the United States on a renewable work permit. Silicon Valley, which has fiercely defended immigration programs, is now expected to face a heavy blow. CEOs of major tech players are urging Trump to reconsider his opinion. Trump’s recent policies have already put him at logger heads with the tech community. Needless to say, last month, tensions sparked between Washington and Silicon Valley following the President’s remarks on the violence in Charlottesville, VA.Anxiety has already gripped the Wall Street over the debate to raise the federal government’s debt ceiling, which has frayed relations between President Trump and the Republican leadership. With the disconnect growing, the chances that the government will shut down is 50/50, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report). In fact, such a shutdown will result in the holdup of all non-emergency government funding such as worker furloughs, closing of public offices, shutdown of national parks and interruptions in implementation of pro-business policies.Harvey & Its ImpactHurricane Harvey, in the meanwhile, lashed the Texas coast in recent days. The storm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions.Investors saw insurance stocks take a hit as its ill effects mounted adding to a dour tone to match the human miseries. Investors were told that one-third of all U.S. refineries are located in the Houston area, which was also severely affected. Are U.S. Stocks Overvalued?As if all of that wasn’t enough, a record number of fund managers see the U.S. market as the most overvalued in the world. Among the 20 valuation metrics tracked by Ned Davis Research, 16 of them indicate U.S. stocks are extremely overvalued.Stocks’ current cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio has only been exceeded in 1929 and 2000 – both prior to major corrections. In 1929, Wall Street was subjected to an infamous crash, while 2000 saw the dotcom implosion. This time around, expansion in profit margins led to loft valuations, which raises concerns of a possible downturn.Talking about pullbacks, Stock Trader’s Almanac found out that in September, since 1950, the S&P 500 and the Dow averaged a loss of 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%, as did the Russell 2000 of small-cap stocks since it was started in 1979.5 Dividend Stocks to Counter the Worst MonthWith so many concerns plaguing investors’ minds, dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment. The best dividend stocks pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects, and are less susceptible to market downturns. Their large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer sizable yields on a regular basis, regardless of market direction.While finding companies that offer these traits isn’t easy, they certainly do exist. To help you find these businesses, we have selected five dividend payers who have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

56,PFG,"Of late, the finance sector has been performing well with some monthly volatility. The nation’s economic health, on which the sector is largely dependent, has been showing steady improvement with increasing real GDP numbers, declining unemployment rate, improving consumer spending and stabilizing housing market.Riding on higher rates and improved lending margins, along with the expectation of lesser regulations under Donald Trump administration, the finance sector has emerged triumphant. The S&P 500 Financials (Sector) Index gained 5.7%, so far this year.Overall, the continuation of structural changes, with investments in emerging technologies, and a rising rate environment keep the prospects for financial stocks bright.The finance companies’ performance in the second quarter was decent. While the companies were able to maintain bottom-line growth, concerns over underlying weakness shadowed the optimism to some extent. Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins. However, lower treasury yields curbed the benefits. Nevertheless, a rise in deposit balances and manageable expense level supported the results.While September is generally considered the worst performing month for the stock market, here we bring a handful of finance stocks that are expected to give good returns, supported by the above mentioned catalysts.Selecting the Winning StocksWe have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlist financial stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank of 1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.To narrow down the list, we have taken stocks with market capitalization of over $4 billion and positive estimate revisions over the past 60 days.Here are the top-four financial stocks that meet the criteria:Santa Ana, CA-based First American Financial Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report) provides various financial services through a network of direct operations and agents in 49 states and in the District of Columbia, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea and globally.Zacks Rank: #2VGM Score: BMarket Cap: $5.3 billionChange F1 Est.

57,PFG,"Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report) remains poised for growth, banking on deeper focus on fee-based revenue sources, strategic acquisitions, improving asset under management and effective capital deployment. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) investment manager looks promising on the back of a number of growth drivers.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $5.19 on revenues of $12.2 billion for 2017. While the bottom line reflects 14.1% growth, the top line shows a year-over-year increase of 5.9%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $5.49 on revenues of $14.5 billion. The bottom line reflects 5.7% growth, while the top line represents a 14.5% year-over-year rise.Principal Financial has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 9.2%.Northbound Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has improved 2.2% in the last 60 days, while the same for 2018 has nudged up 1.3% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank.An Outperformer: Shares of Principal Financial have rallied 27.5% in a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 19.8%. The shares have also outperformed the S&P 500, gaining 13.0% over the same time frame.Attractive Valuation:  Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing investment managers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.61, falling significantly below the industry average of 2.2. Undervalued shares with growth prospects are best investment bets.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Principal Financial has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average four-quarter surprise of 7.26%.Growth Drivers in PlaceRiding on better results at three asset management and asset accumulation segments, the assets under management is expected to increase.

Also, pre-tax margin is anticipated to surge above 30% over the next five years. Over the same timeframe, pre-tax operating margin is expected between 16% and 21% at Life and in the 8-12% band at Specialty Benefits. The company also estimates 50-80 basis points of annual ROE expansion going forward.A strong capital position should further help Principal Financial return value to shareholders. The company expects to deploy capital between $800 million and $1.1 billion in 2017. Over the long term, Principal Financial estimates spending 65-70% of net income in capital deployment.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in investment managers can look at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM  -  Free Report), Pzena Investment Management, Inc (PZN  -  Free Report) and Cohen & Steers, Inc.

59,PFG,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are expected on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.
