3,SYMC,"Anti-virus software maker Symantec (SYMC) late Thursday fired CEO and President Steve Bennett, who had cut costs and was amid a major restructuring during his short tenure at the top.""This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,"" Chairman Daniel Schulman said in a statement.Symantec stock was down 6.5% in after-hours trading, after the announcement. Symantec stock rose 1.6% in the regular session stock market today, closing at 20.91. The stock is down more than 25% since early August.Director Michael Brown was appointed interim CEO while the company searches for a new leader. Brown joined Symantec's board in July 2005 and formerly served as CEO at Quantum.Bennett joined Symantec as a board member in February 2010 and became chairman in August 2011. Bennett was named CEO and president in July 2012.In January, when the company reported a third consecutive quarter of EPS growth acceleration, Bennett told analysts on a conference call that costs had come down because of ""lower spending and increased organizational efficiency.""But sales fell 5% in fiscal Q3 ended Dec. 27, the second consecutive quarterly decline.The company in January 2013 split the roles of CEO and chairman, electing board member Schulman to the latter position.""Separating the positions of chairman and CEO allows me to focus on executing the company's strategic plan and managing the company's operations and performance,"" Bennett said in a statement at the time.In an early February Q&A with IBD, Bennett was asked how things were going after most salespeople had been given new territory assignments.""When you make that kind of big change, it creates some challenges, and we're still working through those,"" Bennett said then. ""We'll be anxious to see how much progress we make in the fourth quarter. The pipeline looks solid.""Symantec is slated to report results for its fiscal Q4 ended on or near March 31 on May 7.In answer to another question in the Q&A, Bennett was candid about the company's challenges, saying, ""We're making the hard decision to position the company to win in the long term and taking a little short-term pain to reposition the company.""Follow Kevin Shalvey on Twitter at @IBD_KShalveyRelated: Symantec CEO Sees More Work In Security Firm's Revamp

4,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks, a leading stock pick, has vaulted higher as it puts a patent dispute to bed and as analysts see its security products in demand at data centers.
"
5,SYMC,"Known for network firewalls and other corporate security offerings, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) makes the IBD Leaderboard list of high-potential stocks. On Monday, it pushed up more than 3% to 83.85.
"
6,SYMC,"""PANW remains a top pick for 2014, our favorite play on the secular trend toward consolidated network-security functionality,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in an early-Monday research note boosting his price target to 105.
"
7,SYMC,"Weiss says several factors, including corporate security purchasing plans, bolster his confidence that the company can sustain 30% or better billings growth in fiscal 2015. He also notes that the company will see slower growth in capital expenditures and a reduction in litigation expenses.
"
8,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks offers a next-generation network-security platform used by enterprises, service providers and government entities to protect their networks from viruses, malware and other threats. Its lineup includes network firewall software and hardware. It also sells subscription services for threat detection and prevention, web filtering and mobile device security.
"
9,SYMC,"Patent Issue Past
"
10,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks stock is up 46% this year and 21% since the firm announced the end of a legal saga May 28 and released third-quarter fiscal 2014 results. They topped estimates with 49% year-over-year revenue growth to $150.7 million, and 57% earnings growth to 11 cents a share.
"
11,SYMC,"""These results were driven by continued strong product demand, robust service growth and a rapid market-share gain in the large and growing strategic enterprise security market,"" CEO Mark McLaughlin said on a call with analysts at the time, noting the firm had ""settled all existing litigation with Juniper.""
"
12,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks paid $175 million to settle a suit in which Juniper Networks (JNPR) claimed that Palo Alto Networks products infringed on six of its patents. Under terms of the deal, Palo Alto Networks agreed to make a one-time payment of $75 million in cash and pay $100 million in shares of common stock and warrants to buy common stock.
"
13,SYMC,"Juniper Networks filed the suit in December 2011. Palo Alto Networks later accused the company of infringing on three of its patents. As part of the settlement, the two firms agreed to license the patents at issue to each other and not file infringement suits for the next eight years.
"
14,SYMC,"""As we said from the beginning of this case, we do not believe that we infringed on any Juniper patents, and we still believe this to be the case,"" McLaughlin said on the Q3 call. ""However, over the course of the last 2-1/2 years, we've spent a large amount of time, money and other resources on this litigation. ... We believe that this outcome will allow us to continue to focus our efforts in what we do best: innovating and developing new products, servicing our customers and the growth that results from that.""
"
15,SYMC,"Although $175 million is a hefty sum for a company with less than $400 million in revenue as recently as its last fiscal year, the settlement did remove ""a key overhang"" on Palo Alto Networks stock, says FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi.
"
16,SYMC,"Stock Sets New High
"
17,SYMC,"With the overhang gone, Palo Alto Networks stock, which debuted in an IPO two years ago, hit a record high of 82.27 on June 17 and then passed that by almost 2% Monday.
"
18,SYMC,"The settlement is also seen resolving hesitancy on the part of some customers to do business with Palo Alto Networks as long as the lawsuit was up in the air.
"
19,SYMC,"""With this removal, we think Palo Alto can experience incrementally more sales,"" Seyrafi noted.
"
20,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks seeks to continue expanding an operation that already includes 16,000-plus customers in more than 120 countries across multiple industries. One potential growth area is in the enterprise market, where it looks to win business with a next-generation security firewall designed for corporate data centers.
"
21,SYMC,"Guard For Data Centers
"
22,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks' new PA-7050 security appliance will help it gain market share in the enterprise market, analysts predict. The product, launched in February, provides up to 120 gigabits per second of throughput speed to analyze threats to corporate data centers.
"
23,SYMC,"""Palo Alto has plenty of room left to take share in enterprise network security,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Rob Owens wrote in a report. ""Data-center deployments account for over 30% of Palo Alto's product revenue, and the release of the PA-7050 appliance expands the opportunity into even higher-performance environments.""
"
24,SYMC,"Meanwhile, analysts praise Palo Alto Networks' ability to win new business in a competitive field that includes pure plays such as Juniper, Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), plus broader hardware and software firms such as Cisco Systems (CSCO).
"
25,SYMC,"""Palo Alto is the clear market leader and is defining the market in the next-generation firewall space,"" Citi Investment Research analyst Walter Pritchard noted. ""With clear differentiation and technology leadership, we see continued share gains ahead for Palo Alto.""
"
26,SYMC,"Among factors working for Palo Alto Networks' potential, Morgan Stanley analyst Weiss notes that 43% of corporate security executives polled plan a firewall refresh (upgrades and replacements) this year vs. 23% last year. And with only 10% using Palo Alto for their primary firewall and/or unified threat-management needs now, he sees room for market share gains.
"
27,SYMC,"Weiss says the company has strong positioning and an improving margin trend past fiscal 2015.
"
28,SYMC,"More Acquisitions Ahead?
"
29,SYMC,"As Palo Alto Networks gains size, it may also eye more buyouts as a way to expand its piece of the pie, analysts say. The firm has not made a huge number of deals through the years, though it has made a couple in 2014. In January, it acquired Morta Security, a Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity company, for an undisclosed sum. In April, it completed its $200 million buyout of Cyvera, a privately held cybersecurity company in Tel Aviv, Israel.
"
30,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks might be set for more acquisitions after its recent decision to issue $500 million of convertible senior notes due in 2019. In a research note, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said Palo Alto intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.
"
31,SYMC,"""We believe the funds from the convertible offering would provide the company with significant latitude to further broaden its technology and next-generation security-solution suite, as it did with its recent acquisition of Cyvera to enter the endpoint-protection space in what we view to be a very positive fashion,"" Ho said.
"
32,SYMC,"A Palo Alto Networks spokeswoman said no company officials were available to speak for this story.
"
33,SYMC,"Financially, Palo Alto Networks continues showing robust growth, notching year-over-year revenue gains of at least 46% each quarter since going public. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 40 cents for fiscal 2014, which ends in July, up from 21 cents last year.

"
34,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) stock rose more than 3% on the stock market today as investors digested a mixed quarterly report from late Thursday containing some ambitious 2015 guidance that led to cautious optimism. The company's stock had previously been down 15% for the year to date.
"
35,SYMC,"The tech security giant, in mid-overhaul and with a new interim CEO since March, delivered Q4 fiscal 2014 revenue and bookings roughly in line with estimates, while margins and earnings per share beat, Cowen & Co. analyst Gregg Moskowitz noted in a Friday report.
"
36,SYMC,"""But far more important was that SYMC's interim CEO and new CFO provided a FY15 outlook that was both more detailed (given this management team is just starting out) and optimistic than expected,"" he wrote. ""However, we're not convinced that SYMC will be able to deliver, and we fear the company is setting itself up for more disappointment.""
"
37,SYMC,"FBR & Co. analyst Daniel Ives called the March quarter results ""good enough,"" but said that ""Everest-like"" challenges remain. The company had begun its overhaul early last year after ending up bloated with too many managers and from acquisitions it had been unable to integrate effectively.
"
38,SYMC,"In an interview with IBD Thursday, interim CEO Michael Brown, appointed in March, said that there is ""a lot of opportunity"" for more operational efficiency on the top and bottom line — everything from tweaks to the product-renewals process to changes in discount pricing and potentially fewer data centers worldwide.
"
39,SYMC,"The company needs ""to be focusing more,"" Brown said, so he will steer toward ""optimizing our businesses based on where they are in their life cycle and growth potential — before we might've had more of a philosophy of 'let's invest in everything.'""
"
40,SYMC,"He told IBD that the company's information-availability and Norton consumer-security businesses are examples of mature segments that can be optimized for margin. Meanwhile, the company's enterprise backup, enterprise storage management and enterprise security businesses are areas where investment can yield better growth. So there will be a shift in research and development spending.
"
41,SYMC,"Symantec reported earnings of 47 cents a share for its fourth quarter, 5 cents ahead of the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and 7% higher than a year ago. Revenue fell 7% to $1.625 billion, below the consensus view of $1.645 billion.
"
42,SYMC,"Symantec gave fiscal Q1 2015 guidance that is, at the midpoint, $30 million above what Moskowitz had estimated. The Symantec guidance calls for revenue between $1.65 billion and $1.69 billion, down from $1.71 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.64 billion.
"
43,SYMC,"For full-year fiscal 2015, the company sees revenue between $6.63 billion and $6.77 billion, roughly unchanged vs. $6.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts had been modeling for $6.66 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters poll.
"
44,SYMC,"""While down seasonally (for Q1 2015), the guidance we have for the full fiscal year is roughly flat in revenue,"" Brown told IBD, ""so growing in the second half.""
"
45,SYMC,"Moskowitz noted that Symantec expects around 28% operating margins in fiscal 2015, reflecting 20-70 basis points of expansion and 50 basis points above his estimate.
"
46,SYMC,"""We believe the FY15 revenue target (and possibly margins) will likely prove somewhat aggressive, at least in the absence of additional M&A,"" Moskowitz wrote. ""We do, however, agree with management's assertions that revenue and bookings will grow moderately in (the second half of fiscal 2015).""
"
47,SYMC,"Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza said in a Friday research note that ""with a CEO search under way, management uncertainty remains high, which will likely stall growth for the foreseeable future, while focus is on business rationalization.""

"
49,SYMC,"Insurers put food on the table by preparing for disasters that most people would rather not think about: fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, car accidents, collapsing buildings. Now they're increasingly writing policies for another worry — cyberattacks.
"
50,SYMC,"One of the many changes brought by the Internet revolution is that stealing customer data or a company's proprietary information is easier than ever. One doesn't even need to be on the same continent anymore to commit the theft. And it can be weeks or even months before the damage is even detected.
"
51,SYMC,"In response, insurers are selling more cyberpolicies . Coverage may include loss or corruption of business data, lost business activity, legal defense costs, the cost of posting cash rewards to catch cybercriminals, crisis communications management, identity theft and defamation via social media.
"
52,SYMC,"While these hazards can be difficult to underwrite, insurers have had years to refine their products.
"
53,SYMC,"""It's probably the fastest-growing aspect of the insurance market right now,"" said Bob Parisi, leader of network security and private practice for insurance broker and risk adviser Marsh USA. ""We've seen nothing to indicate that acceleration is going to wane any time soon.""
"
54,SYMC,"In May, a federal grand jury indicted five Chinese officials for allegedly committing industrial espionage by hacking into the data systems of U.S. Steel (X), Alcoa (AA), Allegheny Technologies (ATI) and others.
"
55,SYMC,"A Chinese businessman was arrested last month for allegedly hacking into the computer systems of Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other companies that have large defense contracts with the U.S. government.
"
56,SYMC,"Recently cyberattacks moved into the top 10 list of global business risks, according to the Allianz Risk Barometer Survey, which polled more than 400 corporate insurance experts from 33 nations.
"
57,SYMC,"""It's more prevalent now than it was and harder to detect,"" said Murray Jennex, a management information systems professor at San Diego State University.
"
58,SYMC,"Yet challenges remain to raise awareness that cyberinsurance can be an effective tool to protect against the costs of repairing and defending against cyberattacks.
"
59,SYMC,"With $2 billion paid in cyberinsurance premiums in 2013, the specialty still makes up a small percentage of the $1 trillion total paid in U.S. insurance premiums last year, said Marsh Management Research, a division of Marsh USA.
"
60,SYMC,"Average coverage limits purchased by firms with more than $1 billion in revenue rose by 10% in 2013 to $28.2 million each, says Marsh. The estimated cost varies widely. A 2014 study sponsored by the software security firm McAfee estimated that cybercrime costs businesses worldwide $445 billion annually. An old Symantec (SYMC) study put that total at $114 billion — 13 years ago in 2001.
"
61,SYMC,"""Many businesses may not completely understand their vulnerability at this point,"" said Robert Hartwig, president and chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute.
"
62,SYMC,"Challenges remain for underwriters and clients to know how much to insure and why. For instance, what is the value of lost privacy?
"
63,SYMC,"""We're a century and a half ahead when it comes to mitigation and prevention of fires,"" Hartwig said. ""We're in the first decade when thinking of how to prevent cyberattacks.""
"
64,SYMC,"The costs of compromised computer security are very real.
"
65,SYMC,"The cybersecurity breach last December at Target (TGT), in which hackers obtained tens of millions of consumers' credit and debit card information, ultimately cost Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel his job.
"
66,SYMC,"The attack made some customers skittish, hurt sales and contributed to a 14% decline in Target's share price over two months. The Minneapolis-based big-box retailer was hit with more than 50 lawsuits, now being coordinated before a federal judge in Minnesota.
"
67,SYMC,"Michaels (MIK), eBay (EBAY), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and St. Joseph Health System all have reported cyberattacks within the last 12 months.
"
68,SYMC,"The number of U.S. companies with cyberinsurance varies with the research. Nearly a third of U.S. companies have a cyberinsurance security policy, according to a 2013 report sponsored by Experian and conducted by the Ponemon Institute. Zurich Insurance Group reported last year that 52% of U.S. companies surveyed were covered, but a study sponsored by Willis Group Holdings (WSH) said that a mere 6% of Fortune 500 companies carry such protection.
"
69,SYMC,"Whatever the number of cyberattacks inflicted or cyberinsurance policies sold, insurers will try to protect clients and cash in on this wrinkle in the Internet revolution.

70,SYMC,"""While it's hard to underwrite,"" said Marsh USA's Parisi, ""that hasn't been a deterrent to insurance companies rushing into this market space.""Insurers put food on the table by preparing for disasters that most people would rather not think about: fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, car accidents, collapsing buildings. Now they're increasingly writing policies for another worry — cyberattacks.One of the many changes brought by the Internet revolution is that stealing customer data or a company's proprietary information is easier than ever. One doesn't even need to be on the same continent anymore to commit the theft. And it can be weeks or even months before the damage is even detected.In response, insurers are selling more cyberpolicies . Coverage may include loss or corruption of business data, lost business activity, legal defense costs, the cost of posting cash rewards to catch cybercriminals, crisis communications management, identity theft and defamation via social media.While these hazards can be difficult to underwrite, insurers have had years to refine their products.""It's probably the fastest-growing aspect of the insurance market right now,"" said Bob Parisi, leader of network security and private practice for insurance broker and risk adviser Marsh USA. ""We've seen nothing to indicate that acceleration is going to wane any time soon.""In May, a federal grand jury indicted five Chinese officials for allegedly committing industrial espionage by hacking into the data systems of U.S. Steel (X), Alcoa (AA), Allegheny Technologies (ATI) and others.A Chinese businessman was arrested last month for allegedly hacking into the computer systems of Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other companies that have large defense contracts with the U.S. government.Recently cyberattacks moved into the top 10 list of global business risks, according to the Allianz Risk Barometer Survey, which polled more than 400 corporate insurance experts from 33 nations.""It's more prevalent now than it was and harder to detect,"" said Murray Jennex, a management information systems professor at San Diego State University.Yet challenges remain to raise awareness that cyberinsurance can be an effective tool to protect against the costs of repairing and defending against cyberattacks.With $2 billion paid in cyberinsurance premiums in 2013, the specialty still makes up a small percentage of the $1 trillion total paid in U.S. insurance premiums last year, said Marsh Management Research, a division of Marsh USA.Average coverage limits purchased by firms with more than $1 billion in revenue rose by 10% in 2013 to $28.2 million each, says Marsh. The estimated cost varies widely. A 2014 study sponsored by the software security firm McAfee estimated that cybercrime costs businesses worldwide $445 billion annually. An old Symantec (SYMC) study put that total at $114 billion — 13 years ago in 2001.""Many businesses may not completely understand their vulnerability at this point,"" said Robert Hartwig, president and chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute.Challenges remain for underwriters and clients to know how much to insure and why. For instance, what is the value of lost privacy?""We're a century and a half ahead when it comes to mitigation and prevention of fires,"" Hartwig said. ""We're in the first decade when thinking of how to prevent cyberattacks.""The costs of compromised computer security are very real.The cybersecurity breach last December at Target (TGT), in which hackers obtained tens of millions of consumers' credit and debit card information, ultimately cost Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel his job.The attack made some customers skittish, hurt sales and contributed to a 14% decline in Target's share price over two months. The Minneapolis-based big-box retailer was hit with more than 50 lawsuits, now being coordinated before a federal judge in Minnesota.Michaels (MIK), eBay (EBAY), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and St. Joseph Health System all have reported cyberattacks within the last 12 months.The number of U.S. companies with cyberinsurance varies with the research. Nearly a third of U.S. companies have a cyberinsurance security policy, according to a 2013 report sponsored by Experian and conducted by the Ponemon Institute. Zurich Insurance Group reported last year that 52% of U.S. companies surveyed were covered, but a study sponsored by Willis Group Holdings (WSH) said that a mere 6% of Fortune 500 companies carry such protection.Whatever the number of cyberattacks inflicted or cyberinsurance policies sold, insurers will try to protect clients and cash in on this wrinkle in the Internet revolution.""While it's hard to underwrite,"" said Marsh USA's Parisi, ""that hasn't been a deterrent to insurance companies rushing into this market space.""

71,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) stock rose more than 3% on the stock market today as investors digested a mixed quarterly report from late Thursday containing some ambitious 2015 guidance that led to cautious optimism. The company's stock had previously been down 15% for the year to date.
"
72,SYMC,"The tech security giant, in mid-overhaul and with a new interim CEO since March, delivered Q4 fiscal 2014 revenue and bookings roughly in line with estimates, while margins and earnings per share beat, Cowen & Co. analyst Gregg Moskowitz noted in a Friday report.
"
73,SYMC,"""But far more important was that SYMC's interim CEO and new CFO provided a FY15 outlook that was both more detailed (given this management team is just starting out) and optimistic than expected,"" he wrote. ""However, we're not convinced that SYMC will be able to deliver, and we fear the company is setting itself up for more disappointment.""
"
74,SYMC,"FBR & Co. analyst Daniel Ives called the March quarter results ""good enough,"" but said that ""Everest-like"" challenges remain. The company had begun its overhaul early last year after ending up bloated with too many managers and from acquisitions it had been unable to integrate effectively.
"
75,SYMC,"In an interview with IBD Thursday, interim CEO Michael Brown, appointed in March, said that there is ""a lot of opportunity"" for more operational efficiency on the top and bottom line — everything from tweaks to the product-renewals process to changes in discount pricing and potentially fewer data centers worldwide.
"
76,SYMC,"The company needs ""to be focusing more,"" Brown said, so he will steer toward ""optimizing our businesses based on where they are in their life cycle and growth potential — before we might've had more of a philosophy of 'let's invest in everything.'""
"
77,SYMC,"He told IBD that the company's information-availability and Norton consumer-security businesses are examples of mature segments that can be optimized for margin. Meanwhile, the company's enterprise backup, enterprise storage management and enterprise security businesses are areas where investment can yield better growth. So there will be a shift in research and development spending.

78,SYMC,"Symantec reported earnings of 47 cents a share for its fourth quarter, 5 cents ahead of the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and 7% higher than a year ago. Revenue fell 7% to $1.625 billion, below the consensus view of $1.645 billion.
"
79,SYMC,"Symantec gave fiscal Q1 2015 guidance that is, at the midpoint, $30 million above what Moskowitz had estimated. The Symantec guidance calls for revenue between $1.65 billion and $1.69 billion, down from $1.71 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.64 billion.
"
80,SYMC,"For full-year fiscal 2015, the company sees revenue between $6.63 billion and $6.77 billion, roughly unchanged vs. $6.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts had been modeling for $6.66 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters poll.
"
81,SYMC,"""While down seasonally (for Q1 2015), the guidance we have for the full fiscal year is roughly flat in revenue,"" Brown told IBD, ""so growing in the second half.""
"
82,SYMC,"Moskowitz noted that Symantec expects around 28% operating margins in fiscal 2015, reflecting 20-70 basis points of expansion and 50 basis points above his estimate.
"
83,SYMC,"""We believe the FY15 revenue target (and possibly margins) will likely prove somewhat aggressive, at least in the absence of additional M&A,"" Moskowitz wrote. ""We do, however, agree with management's assertions that revenue and bookings will grow moderately in (the second half of fiscal 2015).""

123,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC), the largest computer security software maker, made progress on its yearlong overhaul, raised its outlook ahead of analysts' estimates and beat expectations for the most recent quarter in its earnings report delivered after Wednesday's close. But revenue last quarter fell, and Symantec stock was down nearly 3% in after-hours trading. Shares rose 3.7% in the regular session, in…
"
124,SYMC,"A year ago, Symantec CEO Steve Bennett called the security company he leads, the largest in its hot industry group, ""bloated"" after many acquisitions.
"
125,SYMC,"Today, the company is leaner after hefty management cuts and a realignment around 10 functional areas and customer pain points. But there's still much work to be done, he says.
"
126,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) on Jan. 29 beat expectations for its third quarter of fiscal 2014, and raised guidance. But it's not yet growing the way Bennett would like: revenue has declined on a year-over-year basis the past two quarters.
"
127,SYMC,"After the earnings release, Bennett spoke with IBD about the rationale of enduring some short-term pain for, he hopes, long-term gains.
"
128,SYMC,"IBD: You started the corporate overhaul a year ago and in October reported a ""tough quarter."" What's happened since?
"
129,SYMC,"Bennett: We said we had to overcome the shortfall in the second (fiscal) quarter and we did that in the third quarter, and produced results better than the second quarter in every dimension. We exceeded our forecast.
"
130,SYMC,"We're not completely satisfied — we're not growing our revenue year-over-year (it declined 5% YOY for the quarter ended Dec. 27) — but we're going into our fourth quarter with positive momentum. So we're optimistic about the fourth quarter.
"
131,SYMC,"IBD: You mentioned in your earnings release that last quarter Symantec benefited from ""improved total business activity."" What did you mean by that, since revenue fell vs. the year-earlier quarter?
"
132,SYMC,"Bennett: Investors look at our company in terms of what happens with revenue growth plus, they call it, implied billings, which is revenue growth plus the change in our deferred (revenue) balance.
"
133,SYMC,"The deferred revenue is really an important thing.
"
134,SYMC,"We made progress on those fronts from the previous quarters. There's a lead and a lag between bookings converting to revenue. Depending on whether you sell subscriptions or licenses, it comes in different cycles.
"
135,SYMC,"IBD: Almost all of your salespeople had new territory assignments as of fiscal Q2. How have they adjusted?
"
136,SYMC,"Bennett: I think positively, as you can see from the results. When you make that kind of big change, it creates some challenges, and we're still working through those. We'll be anxious to see how much progress we make in the fourth quarter. The pipeline looks solid.
"
137,SYMC,"IBD: What are the most successful functional categories of your business out of this realignment?
"
138,SYMC,"Bennett: Overall, there are really three things we've been focused on as a company, as we move from having individual point solutions to building on our strongest point solutions to answer customer problems.
"
139,SYMC,"One, we're building more integrated solutions and building some industry partnerships, like in November to be a part of the Cisco Systems (CSCO) Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) design (which automates provisioning of applications).
"
140,SYMC,"No. 2, we made a lot of changes in our go-to-market (strategy). As we come up with solutions, we have to fine-tune them.
"
141,SYMC,"And third, we have to focus on taking the complexity out of our systems.

142,SYMC,"IBD: Are you still sticking with the 10 focus areas you picked a year ago? (Mobile Workforce Productivity, Norton Protection, Norton Cloud, Information Security Services, Identity/Content-Aware Security Gateway, Data Center Security, Business Continuity, Integrated Backup, Cloud-Based Information Management, and Object Storage Platform.)
"
143,SYMC,"Bennett: We're changing some things in the reframing, but nothing substantial.
"
144,SYMC,"IBD: Check Point Software (CHKP) on Jan. 28 reported what its CEO Gil Shwed called one of the best quarters he can remember. What did Symantec notice, if anything, about the corporate security-buying environment?
"
145,SYMC,"Bennett: I think the environment is still strong; just read the newspaper every day. We're making the hard decision to position the company to win in the long term and taking a little short-term pain to reposition the company. I think the market's strong and there's a tailwind at our back.
"
146,SYMC,"IBD: Will Symantec be able to compete in the network security segment where Check Point is doing well and several next-gen companies — from Palo Alto Networks (PANW) to Fortinet (FTNT) — are making inroads?
"
147,SYMC,"Bennett: We don't participate in that segment directly. Our strategy has been to partner, and we're close to some announcements on that. We're looking for ways to solve the biggest customer problems vs. always doing things ourselves.
"
148,SYMC,"IBD: You say in your earnings release that you are where you expected to be at this point in your three- to five-year transformation. So, what work remains to be done and what are your targets?
"
149,SYMC,"Bennett: We've been in operational mode now about six months — we're making progress. The feedback on our strategy from around the world is terrific.
"
150,SYMC,"The question is: On this kind of change, can you execute?
"
151,SYMC,"We did better in the third quarter than in the second, and I look forward to improvement in the fourth quarter, and to carry that into fiscal 2015.A year ago, Symantec CEO Steve Bennett called the security company he leads, the largest in its hot industry group, ""bloated"" after many acquisitions.Today, the company is leaner after hefty management cuts and a realignment around 10 functional areas and customer pain points. But there's still much work to be done, he says.Symantec (SYMC) on Jan. 29 beat expectations for its third quarter of fiscal 2014, and raised guidance. But it's not yet growing the way Bennett would like: revenue has declined on a year-over-year basis the past two quarters.After the earnings release, Bennett spoke with IBD about the rationale of enduring some short-term pain for, he hopes, long-term gains.IBD: You started the corporate overhaul a year ago and in October reported a ""tough quarter."" What's happened since?Bennett: We said we had to overcome the shortfall in the second (fiscal) quarter and we did that in the third quarter, and produced results better than the second quarter in every dimension. We exceeded our forecast.We're not completely satisfied — we're not growing our revenue year-over-year (it declined 5% YOY for the quarter ended Dec. 27) — but we're going into our fourth quarter with positive momentum. So we're optimistic about the fourth quarter.IBD: You mentioned in your earnings release that last quarter Symantec benefited from ""improved total business activity."" What did you mean by that, since revenue fell vs. the year-earlier quarter?Bennett: Investors look at our company in terms of what happens with revenue growth plus, they call it, implied billings, which is revenue growth plus the change in our deferred (revenue) balance.The deferred revenue is really an important thing.We made progress on those fronts from the previous quarters. There's a lead and a lag between bookings converting to revenue. Depending on whether you sell subscriptions or licenses, it comes in different cycles.IBD: Almost all of your salespeople had new territory assignments as of fiscal Q2. How have they adjusted?Bennett: I think positively, as you can see from the results. When you make that kind of big change, it creates some challenges, and we're still working through those. We'll be anxious to see how much progress we make in the fourth quarter. The pipeline looks solid.IBD: What are the most successful functional categories of your business out of this realignment?Bennett: Overall, there are really three things we've been focused on as a company, as we move from having individual point solutions to building on our strongest point solutions to answer customer problems.One, we're building more integrated solutions and building some industry partnerships, like in November to be a part of the Cisco Systems (CSCO) Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) design (which automates provisioning of applications).No. 2, we made a lot of changes in our go-to-market (strategy). As we come up with solutions, we have to fine-tune them.And third, we have to focus on taking the complexity out of our systems.IBD: Are you still sticking with the 10 focus areas you picked a year ago? (Mobile Workforce Productivity, Norton Protection, Norton Cloud, Information Security Services, Identity/Content-Aware Security Gateway, Data Center Security, Business Continuity, Integrated Backup, Cloud-Based Information Management, and Object Storage Platform.)Bennett: We're changing some things in the reframing, but nothing substantial.IBD: Check Point Software (CHKP) on Jan. 28 reported what its CEO Gil Shwed called one of the best quarters he can remember.

152,SYMC,"Network security company Check Point Software (CHKP) beat analysts' profit estimates with its fourth-quarter earnings report Tuesday morning, as sales of its high-end appliances for data centers sold well along with its next-generation threat prevention software. It also announced a share buyback of up to $1 billion.
"
153,SYMC,"Check Point stock was up nearly 4% in midday in the stock market today, near 66. Earlier Tuesday, the stock touched a 13-year high of 67.25.
"
154,SYMC,"Check Point's report is the first big one this earnings season out of IBD's hot Computer Software-Security industry group, which ranks No. 6 of 197 groups tracked. Check Point is No. 2 by market cap in the group. No. 1 Symantec (SYMC) reports after the market close Wednesday.
"
155,SYMC,"""This morning, Check Point delivered rock-solid December results, as the company beat the Street across-the-board on the heels of strong cybersecurity tail winds and a healthy product cycle in the company's back pocket,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note. ""It appears, after a somewhat choppy period of growth for the company over the past few years, that brighter days are on the horizon as consistent license growth is now here to stay, in our opinion.""
"
156,SYMC,"Both Check Point and Symantec went into Tuesday slightly down for 2014 amid a checkered stock market — Check Point by 1% and Symantec by 3% — while smaller next-generation security rival Mandiant was up 57%, with a $1 billion acquisition and raised Q4 guidance announced earlier this month. But Check Point's results show corporate purchasing is in gear and that companies are on board with Check Point's modular network security approach involving high-speed security appliances that different software ""blades"" can be added to for different security functions.
"
157,SYMC,"""The fourth quarter represented one of the best quarters that I can remember, which is reflected in our customer wins and deferred revenues,"" Check Point CEO Gil Shwed said in the earnings release.
"
158,SYMC,"Check Point reported Q4 revenue of $387.1 million, up 5% from the year-earlier quarter, and earnings per share of 98 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for EPS of 95 cents on revenue of $383.6 million.
"
159,SYMC,"For the year, Check Point revenue rose 4% to $1.39 billion, with EPS of $3.43. Analysts had been looking for $3.41 and $1.39 billion. Analysts have modeled Q1 at 83 cents EPS and $341.2 million in revenue, with full-year 2014 at $3.64 and $1.47 billion.
"
160,SYMC,"""The company ... is guiding for FQ1 and F2014 results in line with consensus. Still, we are raising our EPS estimates meaningfully due to an increase in our product revenue growth assumptions and due to a lower tax rate (the F2014 tax rate is expected to increase lower than previously expected),"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi wrote in a research note Tuesday.
"
161,SYMC,"Last year, Check Point repurchased 10.1 million shares at a pace of about $135 million a quarter. Under its new plan, which replaces the old one, it can repurchase up to $200 million a quarter.
"
162,SYMC,"Symantec's fiscal 2014 Q3 report Wednesday comes a year after the company announced a big revamp under the direction of recently added CEO Steve Bennett, who told IBD then that the company was ""bloated"" with ""a lot of redundancies"" after many acquisitions over the years. Investors will get to see how effectively the streamlining he planned got put into place.
"
163,SYMC,"After delivering its fiscal 2014 Q2 report in October, Symantec stock dived despite an earnings beat, as the company cut guidance and revenue came in short of analyst views.
"
164,SYMC,"At the time, Symantec cut its guidance for fiscal Q3 to revenue of $1.63 billion to $1.67 billion, down from $1.79 billion in the year-earlier quarter, with EPS of 41 to 43 cents, down from 45 cents.
"
165,SYMC,"Back then, analysts were looking for $1.79 billion and 51 cents. Now, the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for revenue of a little over $1.65 billion and EPS of 42 cents. For the current fiscal Q4, they see revenue of $1.64 billion and EPS of 41 cents, putting full-year results for fiscal 2014 at revenue of $6.64 billion and EPS of $1.77.
"
166,SYMC,"After Symantec and Check Point, the next-biggest security group stocks by market cap, VeriSign (VRSN) and FireEye (FEYE), are set to give their own quarterly reports on Feb. 6. and Feb. 11, respectively. Fifth-in-size Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reported its fiscal Q1 in late November. Its stock was up 4% for the year going into Tuesday trading.
"
167,SYMC,"FireEye this month announced that it bought privately held Mandiant in a deal valued at about $1 billion. Some hopes appear pinned on this purchase with so many recent attacks on companies — Target (TGT) being one of the big ones — and Mandiant's background having included insights into some notable cases. Nearly a year ago it made the high-profile claim that China was behind a series of computer spying incidents.
"
168,SYMC,"FireEye this month said it expects to report Q4 revenue of $55 million-$57 million, up from its earlier guidance of $52 million-$54 million. At the time of the announcement, analysts were expecting $53.6 million.

172,SYMC,"Stocks got off to a mixed start Friday, as the Dow industrials struggled to stretch its rally to an eighth day, but earnings-driven declines by Nvidia (NVDA), Symantec (SYMC) and others dragged on early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average clung to a fractional gain in opening trade. Verizon (VZ) was an early strong suit among blue chips, up 1.9% after an upgrade from JPMorgan.The S&P 500 also defended a narrow gain, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped into tight early losses.

The company offered no earnings guidance for the second quarter. Still, the industry leader's slip threatened the week's strong performance among chipmakers.Friday's early loss dragged the stock back below a flat-base buy point at 254.60.

178,SYMC,"U.S. stock futures turned narrowly positive early Friday, as the Dow looked to extend its six-session win streak and the S&P 500 tacked toward its best week in almost three months.A busy after-hours earnings reporting session on Thursday saw Nvidia (NVDA), Trade Desk (TTD) and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) among the names in motion after hours.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average shook off earlier losses and edged 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures managed even tighter gains.The Dow clocked out on Thursday with its sixth straight advance, lifting the index 2% for the week through Thursday and putting it on track for its first weekly advance in three weeks. The S&P 500 is ahead 2.2%, also eyeing its first weekly jump in three weeks and, so far, its strongest week since early March.The Nasdaq rose 2.7% for the week through Thursday, looking toward its third gain in four weeks. Summed up, the market is on track to exit the week in a lot better shape than when it entered it.IBD 50 name Nvidia slipped nearly 3% in Friday's premarket trade, despite crushing fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations in its report after Thursday's close. Second-quarter revenue guidance was also above views. The company gave no EPS guidance for Q2. At the close of regular trading, the stock was in a buy range above a flat-base buy point at 254.60. The chart also can be interpreted as a double-bottom base with a 239.35 entry.Trade Desk spiked 22% ahead of the open. The Ventura, Calif.-based online advertising platform saw both earnings and revenue growth accelerate in its first quarter. The company's 89% EPS growth and a 61% revenue surge easily topped analyst targets. Management's raised Q2 and full-year revenue and earnings guidance were well above consensus hurdles.Trade Desk shares ended Thursday up nearly 7% for the week, and still struggling to retake their converged 10- and 40-week moving averages. Thursday's extended trading move implied a breakaway gap on Friday, past a 61.03 buy point in a gnarled-looking cup base. It's best to read up on buying breakaway gaps before trying to jump in. And keep in mind that not all premarket moves carry over into regular trade.Among stocks that appeared headed for Friday's injured list, security software developer Symantec (SYMC) collapsed 19% after tripping over weak guidance. DNA screening pioneer Intrexon (XON) fell 7% as losses widened. And Yelp (YELP) dropped more than 4% after analysts gave its first-quarter report mixed reviews.Friday offers up a comparatively light earnings schedule, as well as a very sparse day of economic releases. Import-export price data are due from the Labor Department before the market opens. The University of Michigan delivers its preliminary reading on May consumer sentiment at 10 a.m. ET.Crude oil prices were flat early Friday. Crude gained 0.3% Thursday, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate settling at $71.36 a barrel, up 2.4% so far for the week.

""Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers.""Kroger's decision comes after Dick's and Walmart announced on Wednesday that they would both increase the purchasing age of firearms to 21.

In addition to increasing the age to purchase guns and ammunition, Walmart said it would stop the sale of items ""resembling assault-style rifles,"" such as airsoft guns and toys.""We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms,"" Walmart said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday evening. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based chain said it requires ""customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm.""Dick's said it would stop selling assault rifles like the one used in the Parkland, Florida high school massacre on Feb. 14.

182,SYMC,"Age limits and bans on assault-style rifles are in vogue now, but the biggest threat to gun sales may still be President Donald Trump.X Consumer demand is falling to ""new, lower levels,"" according to the 166-year-old maker of Smith & Wesson firearms. The company, American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), is bracing for the downturn by cutting jobs and repaying debt. Rivals, including one in bankruptcy, are contending with the same slowdown.Call it the Trump slump. The gun industry thrived under President Barack Obama, as firearms enthusiasts expected crackdowns and rushed to stockpile weapons. Those fears have eased -- and sales have fallen -- since Trump won the White House in November 2016. Gunmaker stocks, already on the ropes, took a further hit after the shooting last month at a Florida High School that killed 17 people.""We will operate our business under the assumption that the next 12 to 18 months could deliver flattish revenues,"" American Outdoor Chief Executive Officer James Debney said Thursday on a conference call to discuss earnings.The shares tumbled 13% in premarket trading Friday in New York. American Outdoor fell 27% this year through the close on Thursday. That followed a 39% drop last year.Sturm Ruger (RGR), a rival, fell after the close Thursday. Remington Outdoor Co., the iconic gunmaker controlled for years by Stephen Feinberg's Cerberus Capital Management, plunged into bankruptcy last month.The gun industry has come under greater scrutiny since last month's shooting in Parkland, Florida, even if the potential for tighter restrictions on firearms seems lower than when Obama was president.A social-media movement against the National Rifle Association led to numerous companies cutting ties with the gun-rights group, including Symantec (SYMC), Hertz Global (HTZ), Avis Budget (CAR) and MetLife (MET).Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) said this week they would no longer sell assault-style rifles such as the AR-15, the weapon used in the Florida shooting and made by American Outdoor. The retailers also said they would increase the purchasing age for firearms and ammunition to 21 in their stores.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportDespite Trump's support for gun rights under the Second Amendment, he tweeted this week about potential restrictions. In a meeting with lawmakers late Wednesday, he said some politicians were ""petrified"" of the NRA. Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called on Trump to support tougher curbs Thursday, saying the gun-rights group has had Republicans in a ""headlock for decades.""By Thursday, the president had tweeted about a ""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!"" The discussion with the NRA's chief lobbyist suggested that Trump could be shifting position again in a gun-safety debate that has been deadlocked for years.""Given the more fluid political environment, it's hard to read demand going forward, particularly given growing grass-roots push for controls on sales"" of assault rifles, Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a note to investors Friday.Some forms of gun control, including magazine restrictions and strengthened background checks, are unlikely to have much impact on the manufacturer,  James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Feb. 27 report. Still, the buying sprees seen in past years, when gun rights were perceived to be threatened under Obama, haven't materialized under Trump.The larger problem is flagging demand. It's not just politics. There's also fewer hunters and a diminished sense of urgency around personal protection in an era of declining crime rates.American Outdoor chopped its profit forecast for the third straight quarter. The company projected earnings of 31 cents to 33 cents a share for the current fiscal year, which ends April 30. That trailed the lowest of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Wall Street had been expecting 60 cents a share.The gunmaker also lowered its sales target for the year to a midpoint of $599 million from a December projection of $662.5 million. Analysts had predicted $655.6 million.""We've been adjusting in this challenging market environment and obviously, working really hard internally to get aligned with this market demand,"" CEO Debney said.Debney warned about the sales slump in December, saying the fear-based buying of years past was no longer happening. Slack demand and a glut of inventory were forcing firearm manufacturers to discount heavily, Debney said.Firearm background checks compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a proxy for gun sales, fell 8.4%t last year after increasing in 13 out of the last 14 years. The checks in January were the lowest in six years on an adjusted basis, Debney said.American Outdoor, preparing for an extended slowdown, has repaid $75 million in recent months and extended the due date on $75 million of notes to August 2020.

183,SYMC,"Some of the nation's biggest airlines and financial institutions — including Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Bank of America (BAC) — over the weekend became the latest corporations to rethink their relationship with the gun industry after a shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 dead.X In doing so, those companies join Symantec (SYMC), Hertz (HTZ), MetLife (MET) and others who have said they would end the discounts they offer to members of the National Rifle Association or otherwise re-evaluate their ties with the gun industry.The NRA, in a statement on Saturday, called the moves ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice."" The companies' decisions follow a growing backlash, much of it led by students, against the gun lobby and lawmakers that have been reluctant to pass tougher firearm restrictions in the wake of the shooting, which took place on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Delta Air Lines on Saturday said it would end discounted rates through its group travel program. Similarly, United Airlines (UAL) on Saturday said it would no longer offer a discounted rate to the NRA's annual meeting Both airlines said they were asking to have their information removed from the NRA website.But in response to Delta's move, Georgia's senate blocked a bill that would've provided the airline a tax break on jet fuel.Bank of America, meanwhile, said in a statement to Axios over the weekend that it would ""examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings"" and ""engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for nonmilitary use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.""And the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Blackstone Group (BX) had asked outside fund managers to provide information about any ownership they have in companies that sell or manufacture guns.And State Street (STT) also said it would be ""engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors"" to learn more about promoting ""safe and responsible use of their products,"" according to Reuters. The company is a big shareholder in American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holdings, and Sturm Ruger (RGR).The NRA has more than 5 million members. How the decisions from the companies, many of which control a huge part of their overall markets, might affect business is unclear.""The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world,"" the group's statement said.Shares of firearm companies plunged after President Trump's election. Trump campaigned on a platform of lax gun restrictions. Wall Street was betting the absence of any regulatory threat would create less urgency to buy guns. Gun sales fell sharply in 2017.Sturm Ruger, during its Q4 earnings call last week, briefly commented on the Florida shooting.""Although this call is intended to focus on our business, like all Americans, we also struggle with the shock and sadness of these horrible events,"" Sturm Ruger said. ""We will continue to stand by our model as arms makers for responsible citizens but we are people too and are impacted when tragedies like this occur in our communities.""Sturm Ruger fell 2.1% on the stock market today. American Outdoor Brands slid 2.9% to its worst close in three years. It's unclear if the stocks are falling in reaction to corporate America cutting ties with the NRA, funds rethinking gun stock investments or if investors are betting against significant gun restrictions.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Gun Stocks Struggle After Florida School Shooting; Sturm Ruger Earnings Fall 44%Have Gun, Will Travel: Gun Stocks Jump On Trump PlanWhat Qualifies As An Emotional Support Animal?

184,SYMC,"Most cybersecurity stocks seem to be in a funk heading into 2018 but a pickup in initial public offerings — and, perhaps, mergers — next year might pique the interest of investors.X Venture capital funding for possible new players continues to be strong, says CBI Insights. Among well-funded startups are these names: Tanium, Lookout, Illumio, Cybereason, CrowdStrike, Netskope, Cloudflare, Stackpath, Draktrace and Cylance.Illumio and Cloudflare bear watching in particular as possible IPOs. Other computer security providers that may go the IPO route in 2018 are Zscaler, Tanium, AlienVault, Centrify and ForgeRock, says Renaissance Capital.""There have been some 1,300 startup companies that have been funded in the cybersecurity world overall the past 3 to 4 years,"" said Jonathan Ho, analyst at William Blair. ""So there's increased competition. A lot of those startups are generating revenue, they're starting to eat into the market opportunity of the bigger (public) companies.""The reason for the prospective onslaught? Weak December quarter guidance from several computer security providers generally led to a recurrence of malaise in the sector, analysts say. One exception was an above-consensus outlook from Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which drove its shares higher.What's perplexing to some investors is that security has underperformed other software sectors and the S&P 500 for over two years. That's despite a steady stream of reports over computer hackers like those who breached 3 billion accounts at Yahoo, data breaches similar to those at Equifax, and ransomware attacks just like those at WannaCry.The shift to cloud computing may be one reason for slower revenue growth at security vendors. As large companies shift computing workloads from private data centers to the likes of Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), they're reassessing what security technology they need. Another factor could be an overcrowded market.This year's crop of security IPOs has been mixed. Okta, which went public at 17 in April, is trading above 30 a share. Okta, a provider of identity management services, raised $187 million. Still, investors have been cool to two other smallish IPOs, Sailpoint (SAIL) and Forescout Technologies (FSCT).IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Computer-Software Security group is ranked No. 128 out of 197 industry groups, down from No. 63 two months ago. Qualys has the highest Composite Rating at 96 out of a possible 99, followed by Fortinet at 94 and Palo Alto Networks at 91. No other companies are above 90. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Some IPOs over the next 12-18 months, however, could be bigger. Tanium, Lookout, Illumio, Cloudflare and CrowdStrike are among security startups called unicorns by CBI Insights because their valuations top $1 billion.One problem for public cybersecurity vendors that might want to acquire a hot startup is that valuations are running high.""The public companies are being selective in terms of what they're acquiring,"" said William Blair's Ho. ""They're more willing to look at companies that are struggling, that can be plugged into their sales channel, as opposed to buying the market leader at a high multiple.""Proofpoint (PFPT) in November acquired Cloudmark for $110 million. McAfee, recently spun off by Intel (INTC), in November acquired Skyhigh Networks, a specialist in cloud security. Terms weren't disclosed.One problem for public companies is that as startups go forward with IPOs, they could undermine confidence in existing technologies as they make their case to investors.""The shift to Cloudflare is likely pressuring some of the traditional firewall, web application firewall vendors and other providers,"" Adam Holt, analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a note to clients. ""We'd expect to see an IPO in the next 12-18 months."" Cloudfare provides content delivery as well as security products.Brad Zelnick, a Credit Suisse analyst, has a similar view.""We expect that a pipeline of security IPOs will educate investors on the declining role of firewalls,"" Zelnick said in his note to clients.Firewall network products are the biggest part of the cybersecurity market. Palo Alto, Fortinet (FTNT), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and others compete in the firewall market. Firewalls are located between private networks and the internet and block unauthorized traffic.There's been speculation 2018 could be the start of an upgrade cycle, with companies buying next-generation firewall products. Spending on firewalls and threat detection technologies popped in 2014-15 after a few well-publicized cyberattacks.Zelnick is among analysts that say firewall vendors are in trouble because of cloud computing.""The cloud dissolves the concept of network perimeter,"" he wrote. ""As the corporate network disintegrates we anticipate spend will be redistributed away from the network to the detriment of incumbent firewall vendors."" Some firewall vendors are adapting to cloud computing by focusing on software-as-a-service rather than network appliances that plug into networks.One firewall vendor avoided the recent sell-off. Shares in Palo Alto jumped on Nov. 21 after it reported earnings and revenue that topped views.""Given the overall malaise in the security market, evidenced by the weak guidance for Q4 from nearly every vendor, we believe Palo Alto's strong growth rate and impressive guidance suggests the company is taking share across the board,"" Andrew Nowinski, Piper Jaffray analyst, said in a note.Palo Alto looms as an industry consolidator as it develops a broader product line,  say analysts. William Blair's Ho says Palo Alto's platform provides customers with access to third-party security tools,  giving it a view into what startups are gaining traction and might make a good purchase.If growth slows in the firewall market, security vendors may expand into identity and access management or target artificial intelligence tools that aid in external threat detection, analysts say.Andrew Nowinski, analyst at Piper Jaffray, says startups Carbon Black and CrowdStrike are battling incumbent FireEye in the endpoint security market — detecting threats from smartphones, laptops and other devices connected via the web to corporate networks. The endpoint detection market is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020, says research firm Gartner.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec (SYMC) has been busy. Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion and also purchased LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.Acquisitions by private equity firms slowed in 2017 amid uncertainty over corporate tax reform. Thoma Bravo in November said it will acquire Barracuda Networks (CUDA) in a cash deal valued at $1.6 billion, perhaps a sign of PE firms being more active again, analysts say.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

185,SYMC,"Stocks slipped out of the starting gate Thursday's open, as analyst moves and earnings news factored into early trade, and the budget standoff in Washington gnawed at investor confidence.X The Dow Jones industrial average launched a fraction in the red, with gains by Wal-Mart (WMT) bolstering early trade. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite each dipped 0.1%, as Apple (AAPL) posted a modest early gain and the four FANG stock tech leaders were mixed.

191,SYMC,"As manager Joseph Fath closes in on his fourth anniversary at the helm of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) in January, the $50.7 billion portfolio continues to outperform. Its 28.73% gain this year going into Thursday outpaced 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct. Over the past three years it has notched a 14.54% annual gain, topping 92% of its direct rivals.XThe fund has managed its torrid pace by targeting leading stocks like e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group (BABA), graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and online payment processor PayPal Holdings (PYPL). Those stocks are up 94%, 81% and 80% so far this year. Alibaba and PayPal have been in the portfolio since the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.Nvidia has been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters.Fath and his growth stock team look for companies that have one or more of these traits: superior growth in earnings and cash flow; sustainable earnings momentum even in economic slowdowns; and a lucrative niche in the economy and ability to grow — even amid slow GDP growth.Take Alibaba. ""Alibaba continues to benefit from improving user engagement amid its ongoing social commerce and mobile monetization efforts,"" Fath told shareholders in his semiannual report. ""The massive amount of data that its users generate also provide the company with a competitive advantage that could drive long-term earnings growth.""The Chinese Amazon's earnings-per-share growth has accelerated, having grown 30%, 37% and 60% the past three quarters. Annual EPS has grown for four years in a row. Consensus among analysts is that it will rise 44% this year.Alibaba is a longtime member of the Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia was been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters as the fund initially took profits and then returned to the stock as we gained more conviction in the investment thesis, the growth stock team said.The stock's EPS growth is part of that process of persuasion. Its growth was at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. Still, operating costs have risen as the company invests in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.The stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. That's due to achievements such as a 54% annual EPS growth rate over the past three years.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Nvidia other fundamental and technical traits stack up against its rivals' in IBD's easy-to-understand Stock Checkup.PayPal EPS has also sped up, growing 9%, 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31% in the past six quarters.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group thanks to traits such as four straight years of annual EPS growth.The 31% September-quarter profit topped analysts' views. So did the 21% revenue increase. PayPal issued a current-quarter sales forecast that topped analyst estimates.PayPal is among the IBD 50 roster of fast-growing companies.""We have a high conviction in PayPal as digital online payments are growing significantly on a global scale,"" Fath told shareholders. ""The company's strong balance sheet and the potential to monetize its Venmo peer-to-peer payment platform could lead to further outperformance.""Can Fath keep his streak going? That hinges partly on the performance of new stock buys, such as credit reporting bureau TransUnion (TRU), credit-card payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) and security software firm Symantec (SYMC).TransUnion shares got clobbered in the second week of September amid consumer anger and congressional inquiries sparked by the Equifax (EFX) data breach. But shares have rallied since then, resuming an uptrend that began late in 2016.While credit bureaus suffered withering criticism after the Equifax cyberattack, most of TransUnion's business comes from corporations. Only 23% of its revenue is from what the company calls its consumer interactive segment.And TransUnion has reinforced the corporate-focused part of its business with steps like its acquisition of Datalink Services, a leading provider of vehicle and driving records. The acquisition should enable TransUnion's DriverRisk to offer insurers a full-driving record platform.TransUnion, due to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct. 27, was expected by analysts to post a 21% increase in earnings.Vantiv provides credit, debit and prepaid payment processing. It ranks No. 10 in PayPal's IBD industry group.Last summer the company beat rivals like PayPal to the punch by acquiring British-based Worldpay Group. The deal greatly expanded Vantiv's online capabilities.Third-quarter EPS, reported Thursday, rose 27% to 90 cents, up from Q2's 19% gain. Charles Drucker, president and CEO of Vantiv, said in a release, ""We are investing in high growth segments of the market, including our combination with Worldpay, which will position us as a global acquirer with a leading position in e-commerce.""Symantec develops internet and network security, storage and systems management applications for consumers and enterprises.Shares initially jumped on news of the Equifax breach. They've pulled back a little since early October, but have found support at their 50-day moving average.EPS grew an average of 21% in each of the past three quarters. Analysts estimate a 43% increase for the current stanza and 53% for the current fiscal year.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeTop Mutual Fund Manager Has Several Stocks In Buy Zone

195,SYMC,"Major indexes recouped some of Wednesday's moderate losses while investors awaited a deluge of quarterly results from big-cap tech firms. Biotechs slid on Celgene's (CELG) 18% plunge following disappointing Q3 results.XIBD's biotech-biomedical industry subgroup fell more than 1%, joining military defense, ethical drug, hospital and medical software firms on the downside.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was up around 0.1%, lagging a 0.4% lift for the Dow Jones industrial average and a nearly 0.3% rise for the S&P 500. The S&P SmallCap 600 padded its early gains, rallying nearly 0.6%. Volume decreased vs. the same time on both main exchanges.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly positioned itself for a potential rebound back above the critical 50-day moving average. Shares rose nearly 0.7% to 157.42, edging back above a prior flat-base buy point at 156.75.The megacap tech leader, which reports fiscal Q4 results late Monday, still holds a solid gain since it initially broke out of a first-stage bottoming base on Jan. 6-9, a cup-with-handle showing a 118.12 entry. Shares have rallied as much as 39% since then.The Street expects Q4 earnings to rise 12% to $1.87 a share, extending a streak of low double-digit EPS growth to a third quarter. After that, growth is expected to accelerate; fiscal year 2018 profit is expected to rise 24% to $11.15 a share.Apple's IBD ratings have improved since the start of the year.On Jan. 1, the iPhone and iPad giant showed a lousy Earnings Per Share Rating of 45 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 59. Today, they've risen to 85 and 77, respectively, on a scale of 1 to 99.Apple's example in 2017 is a good lesson in how a stock chart can help an investor spot an excellent turnaround situation. Four quarters ago, the company posted a 15% drop in Q4 earnings per share and a 9% slump in revenue (its third straight year-over-year drop). With such results, and a lagging stock price, no wonder Apple's IBD ratings plunged into mediocrity.However, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, the company continues to create innovative and popular new products. The company also has set a goal of doubling its services-related revenue by decade's end.Sales have risen 3%, 5% and 7% in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q4 sales rising 8%, to $50.79 billion, continuing a slow-yet-steady acceleration in top-line growth.Fiscal year 2018, which ends in September next year, could be even better. Apple's revenue is seen increasing 17% to $266.6 billion, up from an expected 5% gain in the just-ended fiscal year 2017.Celgene reported a respectable 21% jump in Q3 profit to $1.91 a share, and that beat the consensus estimate by 2%. But perhaps Wall Street had been hoping for a bigger beat. Meanwhile, a 10% gain on the top line to $3.29 billion marked the weakest year-over-year increase in more than four years.Did Celgene give investors any sell signals before Thursday's tumble? In fact, yes.Back in June, the cancer treatment specialist bolted out of a somewhat lopsided cup base at 127.74, then rallied 15% to as high as 147.17. But a sharp gap down in heavy trading on Oct. 5 gave a strong hint at a change in the character of the action.Just days later on Oct. 13, Celgene then tripped below its 50-day moving average. Volume ballooned 40% above the 50-day average, a sign that institutions were locking in gains.IBD'S TAKE: In some cases, a great stock will punctuate the end of a rally with multiple sell signals, covered frequently in IBD's Investor's Corner and daily market columns. Check out this article on how to spot multiple sell signals to lock in profits and raise cash to maximize your portfolio return.Fortinet (FTNT) may be working on a  new handle on a double-bottom base. The security software firm is an industry peer of Palo Alto Networks (PANW), currently a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium stockpicking and chart annotating service.Fortinet, slated to report Q3 results after the close today, has moved past a 39.61 buy point within a 13-week double-bottom base. In this base, the second low of 35.44 undercut the first low of 35.87. Fortinet broke out on Oct. 18 in heavy volume and remains in buy range.The buy zone goes up to 41.59.Meanwhile, since Fortinet has not yet climbed to new highs, the possibility of an alternate buy point exists.Notice on the daily chart how the stock has pulled back mildly over the past several sessions. A good handle features such action, running lower along the lows as the stock trades lightly. In a proper handle, the decline usually never exceeds more than 12%. However, a handle must also be a minimum five trading days long; Fortinet has pulled back just four sessions.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the midcap stock sports a good Composite Rating of 94 on a scale of 1 to 99. Despite a mediocre RS Rating, the up/down volume ratio of 1.4 points to heavy-volume buying by institutions over the past 50 sessions.Other top-rated stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group include Nice (NICE) (96 Composite, but thinly trade), Symantec (SYMC) (79 Composite, but also posting a big turnaround in 2017), and Qualys (QLYS) (94 Composite, testing support near the 50-day moving average following an Aug. 3 breakout past a flat base at 44.45).Elsewhere in the stock market, certain consumer-spending plays thrived.Group 1 Automotive (GPI) broke out past a 75.52 buy point in a long cup with handle as shares rose 10% to 77.82. Volume is running more than four times its 50-day average. The buy zone goes up to 79.30.Earnings rose 14% to $2.23 a share, snapping a two-quarter streak of falling profits. Revenue rose 7% to $3.01 billion, matching the biggest increase in seven quarters.On the downside, Raytheon (RTN) undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy volume since late June as shares in the missile maker dropped more than 4% to 180.59. The stock has rallied as much as 32% since clearing a flat-base pattern at 143.49 on Nov. 9 last year.Raytheon reported a 7% increase in Q3 earnings to $1.97 a share, beating views. But it's also the third quarter of single-digit EPS growth in the past four quarters. Revenue rose 4% to $6.28 billion.A continued dive beneath the 50-day line would trigger a key IBD sell signal.Raytheon faced such a challenge soon after the Nov. 9 breakout last year. The stock spiked through its 50-day moving average on both Dec. 12 and on Jan. 26 this year, but immediately rebounded.RELATED:Know The Cup With Handle; What Makes This Chart Pattern Special?This Psychological Market Indicator Just Made A Mini-SpikeWhat Is The I In CAN SLIM?How To Find Excellent Stocks Like Nvidia: Begin Your Search Here

196,SYMC,"Could cybersecurity specialist Palo Alto Networks (PANW) join Symantec (SYMC) in making acquisitions that reshape the market? At least one analyst thinks so.XAs it laid out its vision for how the computer security market will evolve at an analysts meeting in New York on Wednesday, Palo Alto updated its product strategy but made no major changes to guidance or long-term targets. But Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says Palo Alto may look to boost growth with a big acquisition.""We expect the company to propel itself into the future via a significant acquisition, perhaps by rounding out its visibility feature set with a target such as ForeScout, Gigamon (GIMO), or even Tanium,"" Zelnick said in a note to clients.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Symantec also purchased LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion. Symantec recently has been eyeing Splunk (SPLK), according to a Bloomberg report.Palo Alto competes in the corporate security firewall market vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Fortinet (FTNT). Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from entering a private network and monitor web-based applications.One view is that Palo Alto's share gains vs. those of Cisco and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have slowed. Palo Alto has partnered with Proofpoint (PFPT), Splunk and Tanium in some security areas.Some analysts say that the security industry's bigger incumbents could target privately held companies, such as Zscalar, before a new wave of initial public offerings.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8. Popular features include exclusive stock lists, IBD Stock Checkup, which ranks the leaders in 197 industry groups based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance; and The Big Picture daily update of the underlying market trend.Palo Alto stock edged up a fraction to close at 140.69 on the stock market today. Palo Alto reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue on Aug. 31 that topped expectations, but other recent quarterly reports have disappointed. Palo Alto stock is down 14% from early November 2016.Andrew Nowinski, a Piper Jaffray analyst maintains an overweight rating on Palo Alto with a price target of 155 following the investor day.""Palo Alto has a large opportunity to cross-sell additional products within the installed base, as Palo Alto is only capturing 10-15% of the installed base's current security wallet share,"" he said in a report. ""We continue to believe the company has the most comprehensive platform in the industry, which should enable growth above 20% for the foreseeable future.""RELATED:Roku IPO Takes Flight As Stock Pops On First Day Of TradingApplied Materials Jumps On Stock Buyback, Earnings TargetHow Artificial Intelligence May Light Up These Info Tech Firms

197,SYMC,"Fraudulent online account use has soared since July, says an e-commerce fraud-prevention executive, who adds that the increase in scam attempts is likely to be a result of the Equifax (EFX) data breach, which occurred from mid-May through July but was only disclosed by Equifax last week.XAnd in the wake of significant publicity about the data breach, LifeLock — which sells credit-monitoring services to consumers — says its web traffic soared sixfold and sign-ups increased 10-fold since Sept. 7, according to Bloomberg.Michael Reitblat, CEO and co-founder of e-commerce fraud-prevention company Forter, told IBD, ""We've seen about a 15% increase in account takeover activity in the one and a half or two months since July. We can't be certain that it is from the Equifax hack. But the quality of data is higher, which leads us to think it is related. It is just circumstantial. But the (fraudsters) seem to have more authentic information.""Reitblat says scam artists recently seem to have more than the usual amount of victims' actual identification information, such as Social Security numbers, names and addresses.Forter works by functioning as an intermediary when customers do online transactions. In real time, it aims to filter out attempts at using accounts created by crooks who obtained the accounts by using purloined information. The crooks create accounts that get billed to the people whose information was stolen. Forter reimburses retailers for transactions it authorizes that turn out to be by identity thieves.""We review over $20 billion in transactions a year in the U.S.,"" Reitblat said.He adds that the Equifax data breach ""looks like the essentially worst breach in U.S. history. It will have grave financial implications, not only for Equifax but for the whole financial ecosystem.""Still, he anticipates a silver lining. ""This will change the way merchants store data and share data. We will end up with a better, safer world"" because merchants will implement systems that do a better job of screening out fraudulent transactions.Lifelock is part of software firm Symantec (SYMC).Equifax, one of the three major U.S. credit bureaus, says online thieves stole sensitive data for as many as 143 million U.S. consumers. The theft involved files that included people's names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and in some cases driver's license numbers.The hackers also accessed the credit-card numbers of about 209,000 consumers. And the thieves accessed what Equifax called some dispute documents containing personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers.Equifax's stock has cratered 35% in the past two weeks.Symantec's stock broke out above a 33.32 buy point in an irregular base Tuesday before easing just below the buy point the past two days.  The stock ranks 4th in IBD's computer software security group, according to Stock Checkup.RELATED:Should You Join Lawsuits Mushrooming Against Equifax?What You Should Do Now To Protect Yourself From The Equifax Data BreachHow You Can Protect Yourself From The Equifax Identity-Theft HackWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

207,SYMC,"Heat continues to mount on credit reporting agency Equifax (EFX), which last week disclosed a massive breach in which hackers stole the personal identification information of as many as 143 million consumers.XOn Thursday, an open-source software organization said that it had publicly posted a patch for the vulnerability that hackers used to access Equifax data about two months before the hack, but that apparently Equifax did not install the patch before the breach took place, if it ever did.Separately on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating the data breach. In addition, several congressional bills were filed that would hold Equifax and other data brokers accountable for such errors. And on Friday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and other senators will introduce a bill to require credit bureaus to let consumers freeze their credit for free, according to Reuters news service. Some credit agencies charge around $5.A credit freeze blocks criminals from setting up bogus accounts whose purchases get charged to victims.The open-source software organization, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), told IBD that it posted a patch for the vulnerability known as CVE-2017-5638 in the Apache Struts program on March 7.Equifax identified that as the vulnerability that hackers used. But the hack did not take place until mid-May through July, Equifax has said. Equifax realized it had been breached on July 29. Equifax disclosed the breach on Sept. 7.ASF suggested that an organization such as Equifax is presumed to be aware of such postings, but ASF does not know what if anything Equifax did know about the patch. It said that Equifax is not a customer of ASF and that ASF has no one-on-one relationship with Equifax.ASF spokeswoman Sally Khudairi told IBD by email: ""The Apache Software Foundation provides Open Source software that is freely available to all at no cost or restriction on its use. Those who wish to use our software projects simply download the projects from apache.org and/or one of many globally-distributed mirror sites.""Khudairi added: ""Any risks, along with patches, are announced and widely shared with Apache project communities. In addition, security vulnerabilities or exploits are disseminated on sites such as NIST (U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as dozens (if not hundreds) of software providers and security specialists (such as MITRE and Symantec).""Further, Khudairi said, ""As with all Apache software, patches are made available to the public at large. Financial services organizations are often known for being highly aware of security vulnerabilities in general, and are therefore particularly vigilant with their processes for patching any known exploits.""Equifax has not yet responded to IBD questions concerning the patch.ASF oversees more than 350 leading open source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — which it calls the world's most popular web-server software. ASF is a not-for-profit charitable organization, whose sponsors include high-profile corporations such as Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT), Target (TGT) and Yahoo.Any entity can use ASF's software, even if they are not a sponsor. Equifax is not a sponsor.No one using the ""@equifax"" domain has communicated via email with ASF for almost two years, Khudairi says. ASF can't tell if an Equifax person communicated with ASF using a personal email address.On Sept. 8, the day after disclosing the breach, Equifax stock gapped down 14%. In the stock market today, its shares were trading near 91.40, down 37% from its 52-week high reached July 26.Shares in Symantec (SYMC), which owns credit monitoring service LifeLock, broke out above a 33.32 buy point in an irregular base Tuesday. It dipped below the buy point the next two days but rose back above it Friday. The stock ranks fourth in IBD's computer software security group, according to IBD's Stock Checkup. The industry group's ranking has risen to 60 from 177 three weeks ago.

210,SYMC,"Investors in the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK) woke up Aug. 1 to find their fund had a new name, ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF, and tracks a new index.XIn a stunning development, the fund's advisor, ETF Management Group, had rebranded the entire family of PureFunds ETFs with the ETFMG name, and began following indexes from a new firm called Prime Indexes.Since the change, $36 million has flowed out of HACK, which has $1.1 billion in assets, according to Morningstar Inc. The outflow has coincided with a pullback in cybersecurity stocks and the ETFs that invest in them.While HACK's old and new indexes both track the same securities, there were some slight changes in the new index to conform with a new methodology and improve implied liquidity, said Sam Masucci, chief executive of ETF Management Group. The change had little effect on the share price.The story highlights the issues small asset managers without infrastructure can run into. ETF MG is known as the advisor. It provides the infrastructure for operating the ETF and portfolio management, as well as manages the third-party relationships with outsourced services, such as custodians, legal and auditing. ETF MG has 13 funds on the market.PureFunds was the sponsor, covering most of the costs. Typically, the sponsor's role is branding, marketing and consumer education. ETF MG is now the sponsor.Unlike the ETFs of most small asset managers, when HACK launched in 2014 it was an immediate hit. It quickly gathered $1 billion in assets. Andrew Chanin, Pure Funds' chief executive, was lauded as an ETF wunderkind. Altogether, PureFunds launched eight funds with ETF MG, six of which will continue under the ETF MG name. The other two were closed in July.""People come to us with ideas that we turn into ETFs and operate. We are a comprehensive service company,"" said Masucci. ""Their role is market education. With more than a dozen partners, we've only had one that went this direction.""Masucci said the dispute started in April when the board voted to lower the fund's expense ratio to 0.6% from 0.75% in order to better compete with First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), which charges 0.6%. At the point, HACK had $950 million in assets, while CIBR had $218 million.""I alerted Andrew, and the Nasdaq and Andrew sued us,"" said Masucci. ""When Andrew sued us he violated provisions in our agreement precluding him from taking any actions that interfered with the operation of the fund. We would have not terminated them if they had not sued us.""Masucci also said that Chanin did not originate the idea for the fund. He said that came from Kris Monaco and his team at ETF Ventures, a division of ISE, which was later acquired by Nasdaq. Masucci said Nasdaq disbanded the ETF Ventures team. Monaco, who was instrumental in creating the index that PureFunds ISE Cyber Security tracked, is one of the founders of Prime Indexes, which is providing the new index for the fund.Chanin disputes the claims by ETF MG. He said PureFunds and ISE were partners and they hired ETF MG, not the other way around. And that it was PureFunds and its partners that helped cover the fund's expenses.In the complaint filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, PureFunds claims that ETF MG was retained to ""empower"" PureFunds to launch their ETFs. PureFunds alleges that ETF MG ""trumped up false securities violations"" with the purpose of obtaining control of the PureFunds business to pocket millions in annual revenue. It also alleges that ETF MG reduced the ""profit"" that PureFunds was to receive from ""their ETFs.""""The pressure on asset managers to reduce their fees is as great as it's ever been,"" said Ben Johnson, Morningstar's director of global ETFs research. ""The vast majority of flows are going into the ones with absolute rock-bottom expense ratios. That's the trend.""HACK has risen 10.4% this year, but is down 4.8% in the past three months. CIBR, which was launched in June 2015, is up 8.3% this year, but also down 4.8% the past three months.CIBR now has $275.6 million in assets.The two funds have similar top holdings. HACK's 39 holdings as of Aug. 15 were topped by Cisco Systems (CSCO) at 4.75%, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) at 4.49% and Symantec (SYMC) at 4.12%. CIBR top holdings were Palo Alto Networks at 6.87%, Cisco Systems at 6.31%, and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) at 6.09%.The other funds affected by the change, with assets and expense ratios:RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Today

227,SYMC,"X The U.S. government's 'stockpiling' of cyberweapons opened the door to the WannaCry ransomware attack, Microsoft (MSFT) alleged Monday as new concerns over computer hacking sent shares in security vendors up.Further, while the WannaCry ransomware attack targeted PCs with Microsoft software, one researcher said Apple (AAPL) could also be hit with similar attacks. Aleksandr Yampolskiy, founder and chief executive of SecurityScorecard, told CNBC that Apple computers are also vulnerable as well.The WannaCry ransomware seemed to be built to exploit computer spying tools originally designed by the U.S. National Security Agency, researchers said. Cybersecurity experts say the worm exploits those NSA tools and takes advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft software to spread the infection.""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a blog.The WannaCry ransomware attack hit 10,000 organizations and companies in more than 100 countries on Friday. A second wave was expected early this week. WannaCry encrypts files with a key that only extortionist hackers can access. After computers are disabled, a message pops up demanding a ransom.""This attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem,"" said Smith. ""This is an emerging pattern in 2017. The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.""Microsoft has updated its security software to deal with the crisis.Microsoft shares rose 0.1% to 68.43, closing near session highs and still in range from a 66.01 buy point. Apple was off 0.3% to 155.70 after hitting a record 156.65 intraday.But shares in cybersecurity specialists Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT) and FireEye (FEYE) rose solidly Monday, following gains on Friday.""We believe organizations that have been affected (by WannaCry) will likely increase their cybersecurity spending,"" said Jonathan Ho, a William Blair analyst in a report. ""While we do not expect an immediate return to the breach reaction spending seen in 2015 from the large number of enterprise attacks discovered during that time frame, we believe that attacks such as WannaCry will help sustain awareness and willingness to spend among organizations.""After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat-detection technologies.

230,SYMC,"Growth-hungry Cisco Systems (CSCO) has its groove back in cybersecurity — maybe in just the nick of time.With its core network business shrinking, cybersecurity seems a good bet for Cisco, analysts say. Hacker attacks are more sophisticated and widespread, while large companies and government agencies are making digital asset security a priority.And with Cisco being the Dow component and networking giant that it is, it can grow via acquisitions — something it's never been shy about doing. The new head of Cisco's security business, David Ulevitch, came from startup OpenDNS. Cisco acquired the specialist in advanced threat detection in 2015 for $652 million.""I think of us as a very large security startup,"" Ulevitch told Investor's Business Daily in an interview. ""There are only two competitors near our size, IBM (IBM) and Symantec (SYMC). We get to leverage the Cisco customer base and sales organization. But I like to operate like a startup that's growing out into the market for the first time, with products that are extraordinarily competitive, because customers are looking for best in class.""Cisco's security revenue jumped 14% to $528 million in the January quarter, growing at roughly twice the rate of the overall market. For the computer networking giant as a whole, however, fiscal 2017 revenue is forecast to grow a paltry 1% to $48.4 billion. That figure excludes divestitures.Meanwhile, cybersecurity has room to grow, comprising only 6% of Cisco's total revenue now. Cybersecurity is one key to Cisco's shift to a software and services business model from its origins in internet routers and switches. With security and other initiatives, Cisco's goal is to grow recurring revenue from software subscriptions.In late 2016, Cisco combined its networking hardware and security businesses under David Goeckeler, a senior vice president and general manager. Cisco plans to leverage its huge networking customer base and distribution channels to sell security products.Cisco was an early leader in internet firewalls that block unauthorized traffic from entering private networks. But Cisco, along with Juniper Networks (JNPR), let its product offerings grow stale.That opened the door for Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and others that introduced next-generation firewalls better suited for handling web-based applications a decade ago.Cisco took its eye off the security market for a while but has ""woken up,"" said Jonathan Ho, a William Blair analyst who follows rivals such as Palo Alto and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP).There is one caveat, though. Corporate budgets have tightened up since 2015's spending frenzy.""Security is a dynamic market where you cannot rest on your laurels,"" Ho said. ""Their customers want to stick with them, but they weren't offering compelling products before and now they seem to be doing a much better job.""Acquisitions have jelled. The 2013 purchase of Sourcefire for $2.7 billion continues to breath new life into Cisco's network security products, making Cisco a player in next-generation firewalls. Martin Roesch, Sourcefire's founder, is still at Cisco as a vice president and chief architect for the security business group.""(Cisco) has acquired a number of private companies that help them offer a broader solution than the competition,"" Ho added. ""Customers want to buy more capabilities from a single vendor, particularly if they can integrate those solutions. That seems to be the direction Cisco is heading. And the companies they are buying are addressing more forward-looking issues like public cloud and advanced threats.""Some analysts view Cisco as a security industry consolidator that could snap up more public companies, such as Sourcefire. Acquiring Check Point or Palo Alto, for example, would double the size of Cisco's security business. But, there might be too much product overlap and integration risks, analysts say.Instead, Cisco may kick the tires at more private companies. Aside from OpenDNS, Cisco bought Lancope for $452 million in 2015 and CloudLock for $293 million last year.Cisco's investment fund has backed many security startups, including Exabeam, HyTrust, Netronome, Team8, eSentire, and Skyport Systems. As in the case of OpenDNS, Cisco sometimes acquires startups it has backed.Venture capital funding in cybersecurity jumped in 2014 and 2015 after a slew of high-profile data breaches, reaching $2.5 billion in 2014 and $3.7 billion in 2015, says CB Insights.Ulevitch says he expects a shakeout among startups. It could give Cisco an opportunity to acquire emerging security technologies at fire-sale prices.""I think we're in for a Malthusian (unsustainable) environment where all these startups have been funded but there's not enough customer dollars to satisfy them,"" he said. ""There's innovation from startups but not revenue acceleration. It'll be interesting over the next 12 to 18 months. I think you're going to see a lot of consolidation.""UBS estimates that Cisco still garners half of security revenue from firewalls and intrusion prevention appliances, though it's expanding into other security markets.By acquiring Sourcefire in 2013, Cisco obtained firewall, intrusion detection and advanced malware protection technologies.With the purchase of ThreatGrid in 2014, Cisco got ""sandboxing"" technology that executes suspicious code in an isolated environment to test if a program contains a virus or malware. Through those moves, analysts say Cisco has been gaining share vs. FireEye (FEYE) in the advanced malware protection market.Cisco also competes with Proofpoint, an email security specialist. Proofpoint's software spots malware-ridden emails before they arrive in inboxes. Cisco gained email protection tools through the 2007 acquisition of IronPort Systems.With corporate America outsourcing more information-technology department workloads to cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, many security firms have been racing to acquire cloud tools. With the CloudLock acquisition, Cisco gained cloud-access security broker software. Cloud-access security products act as a middleman between a corporate network and web applications hosted externally.Analysts say internet firewalls have become a security hub, meshing various technologies. But, one worry for Cisco is that spending on network security could slow as companies prioritize new security tools.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in an October report, said Cisco could push into identity and access management, where many private companies are active, as well as security vulnerability management. Okta (OKTA), a startup that provides access management tools that authenticate network user credentials, has filed to go public. If Cisco moves into security analytical tools, it would take on Splunk (SPLK) and others.One of Cisco's challenges, analysts say, is in winning back ""thought leadership"" in how companies should combat hackers, some of whom are state-sponsored. With its networking products installed at millions of locations, one of Cisco's strengths is visibility into global internet traffic on a daily basis.To set its security technology apart, Cisco aims to turn its switches and routers into network sensors that gather intelligence and detect threats.""We gave petabytes of data that we analyze on a daily basis, and turn into strategic effectiveness,"" Ulevitch said. He says Cisco has 300 security researchers, some working on artificial intelligence and machine learning.Vijay Bhagavath, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Cisco outlined plans at a security conference in March on using its ""Talos"" security research outfit for tracking threats across corporate networks. Cisco expects attacks that flood a website with illegitimate requests for data to increase, for example.""Cisco's moat in next-generation security is driven by scale of the company's 400,000-plus sales-channel footprint and $200 billion networking installed base,"" Bhagavath said in a report.Amid slowing revenue growth, Cisco has restructured to lower costs. In 2016, Cisco cut 5,500 positions, about 7% of its workforce.While Cisco transforms itself, it has steadily hiked dividends. Cisco stock has been trading at the highest levels since the eve of the 2008 bear market. Cisco has $70 billion in cash on its balance sheet, giving it dry powder for shareholder returns and strategic moves.After shooting past the 32 level in mid-February, Cisco shares climbed then retreated. The stock was up 0.2% Monday to 33.02.

The Nasdaq composite also climbed 0.3%, its fifth straight advance, to a record close, less than nine points below its all-time high set last week. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 did set an intraday best Thursday. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.8%, retaking its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco Systems is trading close to a proper entry point. The latest Investing Action Plan highlights five more Dow stocks near buy range that hail from a variety of industry sectors.Several cybersecurity plays have been showing positive action, with five crafting bases or consolidations worth watching.Cisco Systems is a networking giant, with the bulk of its revenue still hailing from routers, switches and other hardware. But Cisco is moving into software and services, including network security. For its latest quarter, security revenue rose 14% to $528 million, the best growth of any segment, while total sales dipped 2% to $11.6 billion.Cisco, which has been trading tightly, is working on a flat base, needing one more day to make it a valid pattern with a potential buy point of 34.63. Cisco shares were unchanged at 33.74 on Thursday.Symantec has made some sizable acquisitions over the past year, beefing up key areas as it competes with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and others. Earnings growth has revived, fueling the stock.Symantec shares broke out of a flat base on Jan. 13, continuing to advance on its earnings report in early February and peaking at a record-high 31.10 on March 13. Symantec has traded in a narrow range for nearly three weeks. Like Cisco, Symantec needs one more day to complete a three-weeks-tight pattern, which would have a 31.20 buy point.Fortinet tried to clear a 38.43 flat base entry on Thursday, hitting 38.56 intraday — the highest since October 2015 — before reversing lower to close at 37.85. The stock had found support at its rising 50-day line on Monday.Fortinet is on IBD's Leaderboard, a premium service that provides annotated charts of a careful selection of growth plays and other stocks that are at or near buy points or other actionable areas.VeriSign is a leading domain name registration company, along with having network security offerings. Profit and revenue growth have slowed modestly in the past two quarters, with analysts expecting further EPS slowing in the current quarter.But shares, which have been consolidating for the past 11 months, have been steadily rising in 2017. The stock has formed a handle with an 88.18 buy point.Qualys rose as high as 38.38 on Thursday, a five-month high and above a 37.62 buy point. But the stock pared its gain to 1.8%, at 37.60, just below that entry. Much like Fortinet (and the broader market), Qualys found support at its 50-day line on Monday.Asian trading was mixed in Friday intraday trading, with Japan's Nikkei and China's Shanghai composite up modestly and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lower.A Chinese manufacturing index rose in March to the highest level in nearly five years.RELATED:Stocks Aren't Waiting For Trump To Make America GreatAcquisitions Bolster Symantec Vs.

234,SYMC,"FireEye's (FEYE) stock popped on an upgrade to buy by a Goldman Sachs analyst, who's upbeat on a new security product platform but also sees a possible acquisition of the company.Shares in FireEye, also upgraded on Monday by Bank of America to buy, jumped  6% to 12.19 in the stock market today. Gabriela Borges, a Goldman Sachs analyst, says there's a 15% to 30% chance FireEye could be acquired. Borges says an offer at around $18 per share could seal a deal.That would be lower than FireEye's apparent asking price nine months ago.""Bloomberg reported in June 2016 that FireEye had received proposals from multiple potential acquirers earlier in 2016, but the company said that it had expectations for $30 per share or higher,"" said Borges. The Goldman Sachs analyst says  that FireEye holds $1.3 billion in tax credits that could attract a buyer.Symantec mulled an offer for FireEye six months ago, according to one report.FireEye provides web, email and malware security software to businesses and government agencies.Borges on Thursday also downgraded Proofpoint (PFPT) to sell from neutral. Proofpoint stock fell 6.8% to 73.79.IBD'S TAKE: The Computer-Software Security group is ranked only No. 143 out of 197 industry groups.  Fortinet and Check Point Technologies have the highest Composite Rating at 88 and 86 out of a possible 99, respectively. ""We forecast moderating share gains in email security, as McAfee contributions are peaking and customers are increasingly choosing ""good enough"" security technologies over ""best in breed,"" said the Goldman Sachs analyst.FireEye on Feb. 2 reported fourth quarter revenue and billings that missed views and announced management departures.  FireEye said its CFO, Mike Berry, and board chairman, David DeWalt, were leaving. FireEye also forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates.Borges, though, is upbeat on a new Helix-branded security product.

235,SYMC,"Symantec[ticker symb=SYMC] is making the right moves with acquisitions, says Morgan Stanley, which upped its price target on the computer security software provider Wednesday.Analyst Keith Weiss upped his price target to 37 from 33 a share, noting that recent acquisitions should help improve its standing amid rivals such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW).""(With acquisitions) Blue Coat and LifeLock, we see Symantec posting high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2018/19 on an organic basis and 36% operating margins in 2019 — a material improvement from Symantec's flat growth profile and 28% operating margins in December 2015,"" Weiss said in a note to clients.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark became Symantec's CEO in August. Then in February, Symantec closed the purchase of LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.""With the LifeLock and BlueCoat acquisitions, we see Symantec returning its consumer business to growth while better addressing long-term secular themes within enterprise security, such as consolidation into security platforms and increased visibility across multiple attack vectors,"" added Weiss.Symantec on Feb. 1 reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped views but forecast current-quarter sales and profit below expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Revenue growth is harder to come by for many security vendors these days as large companies reassess spending priorities. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which tops the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, reported revenue growth of 38% to $6.9 billion in 2016.The LifeLock deal is aimed at bolstering its Norton security unit. The Blue Coat acquisition put Symantec in the fast-growing cloud-access security broker market. CASB products act as a middleman between a corporate network and cloud applications hosted externally.Symantec recently announced a $1 billion debt offering. It could make more acquisitions, says Weiss.""We believe Symantec will focus its investments on the enterprise side of its business, adding technology that bolsters its security focused on the cloud, and endpoint detection/remediation capabilities,"" he wrote.Symantec stock rose 2.2% to 30.66 on the stock market today.

240,SYMC,"The major indexes made piecemeal moves in afternoon trading Wednesday, but techs continued to lead the way higher with just three more trading sessions left in March.Cisco Systems (CSCO) is taking a breather, falling nearly 0.7% to 33.76 in light volume and hampering efforts of the Dow Jones industrial average to rally. The 30-member Dow is down roughly 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite and the tech-rich Nasdaq 100 are both up about 0.3%. The S&P 500 inched slightly higher and is just above 2360.Cisco shares, however, are still up more than 5% past a recent flat-base entry at 31.99. It's been featured frequently in IBD's Income Investor column, which highlights companies that have excellent earnings stability, a minimum 2% annualized yield, and decent relative strength.Cisco, the greatest stock market winner of the 1990s as it literally built the plumbing of the world wide web, no longer has the same growth characteristics as it did when it initially cleared a double-bottom base as a small-cap growth leader right after the stock market bottomed in October 1990. Now, with a $169 billion market cap and a 3.4% annualized dividend yield, the Silicon Valley stalwart in data networking routers, switches and other communications gear has been busy battling new upstarts including Arista Networks (ANET), currently ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50.Arista, embroiled in a technology patent court battle with Cisco, is down nearly 0.7% to 133.00, but volume is quiet and the stock's uptrend is firmly intact since its breakout past a 75.50 cup-shaped pattern in the week ended Aug. 12, 2016.That cup helped put the finishing touches on a long bottoming base pattern, seen among many current stock market leaders today. Arista went public in June 2014 at 43 and quickly ramped up to 94.84, then went into a deep freeze for nearly two years before finally building that first-stage cup pattern and eventually breaking out to 52-week highs.Arista has grown earnings per share 54%, 47%, 51%, 36%, 37%, 41% and 30% vs. year-ago levels over the past seven quarters. That amazing track record of profit growth is one reason why the Santa Clara, Calif., firm holds a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Revenue rose 33% to 42% over that same time frame. Wall Street sees FY 2017 earnings growth slowing, up 14% to $3.77 a share.As noted in a recent Big Picture column, while policy at the federal government level can certainly spur entrepreneurship and risk-taking, it's the innovative companies themselves that are the true engines of economic growth and job creation. Look for those companies that have outstanding products and services, rock-solid management, and stocks that have the ability to power to new highs and rise above their 10-week moving averages.All of these factors go into IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investment paradigm, noted by AAII as the top investment strategy for stocks across multiple time periods going back to the late 1990s.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which has redefined the way people shop for cosmetics, hair and skin care products and services, has made a terrific move since clearing a three-month cup at 188.58 back on March 11, 2016.Ulta today gained 0.57 to 283.43 and is currently in the proper buy zone, up 3% past a 274.09 entry in a double-bottom-with-handle base. Shares broke out of the slightly warped-looking pattern in early February in light volume. Both the advance and volume picked up steam on March 10, a day after Ulta reported a 33% jump in fiscal Q4 earnings per share and a 25% rise in revenue to $1.58 billion.That matched the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 16 quarters.The top-performing specialty retailer is expected to see strong double-digit EPS growth during the next two fiscal years (up 24% in FY 2018 to $8.07 a share, up 21% in FY 2019). In tech land, NetEase (NTES) also deserves continued watch. The Chinese giant in online video games is basing after rising past a 257.78 cup-with-narrow-handle entry. Watch for potential support at the 10-week line.Symantec (SYMC) is staging a stunning turnaround, not just in stock price but also in profits. The stock, up more than 1% to 30.84, has shot 19% past a 25.82 flat-base entry.Wall Street sees earnings rising 14% to $1.19 a share in FY 2017, which ends this month, then galloping 47% higher to $1.75 a share in FY 2018. Industry peer Fortinet (FTNT) rose 4% to 38.08 in above-average turnover.The stock joined IBD's new SwingTrader premium service as one with potential to make a strong move over a period of several days to potentially a few weeks.Finally, digital marketing and imaging software leader Adobe Systems (ADBE) continues to thrive, edging up for a sixth straight session to 129.21. The San Jose, Calif., firm cleared a 107.90 entry in a shallow double-bottom base with handle in early January and has climbed as much as 19%.Adobe gets a solid 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99. Wall Street sees profit rising 31% to $3.95 a share in FY 2017, ending in November, and another 26% to $4.99 a share in FY 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today I: Can Snap Finish A First-Stage Base?Stock Market Today II: 5 Solid Big Cap Names For 2017How To Invest: The Elements Of A Bottoming Base PatternHow To Invest: How To Find An Outstanding Cup-With-Handle Base

Revenue climbed 20% to $1.09 billion for the three months ended Dec. 30.Analysts had projected non-GAAP profit of 28 cents and $1.08 billion in revenue.In the current quarter, Symantec forecast profit of 28 cents, up 27%, and $1.08 billion in sales, up 25%, at the midpoint of its guidance range, vs. consensus estimates of 29 cents and $1.1 billion.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec stock was down 3% in after-hours trading in the stock market today, following the company's earnings release. Shares fell 1% to 27.25 in the regular session Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Revenue growth is harder to come by for security vendors these days. Chipmaker Nvidia, which tops the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, reports earnings on Feb. 9. Inphi, a member of IBD's Sector Leaders, reports on Feb. 7.Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark became Symantec's CEO in August. Symantec in November announced it would acquire LifeLock, a provider of identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.John DiFucci, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, says Symantec might revise guidance when the LifeLock deal closes.Symantec sells security software to both businesses and consumers. Analysts say the LifeLock deal is aimed at bolstering its Norton security unit.Symantec's anti-virus software is often bundled with PCs. The Blue Coat acquisition put Symantec in the fast-growing cloud-access security broker market. CASB products act as a middleman between a corporate network and cloud applications hosted externally.Symantec on Wednesday also announced a $1 billion debt offering. Although Symantec will have some $8 billion in debt when the LifeLock deal closes, analysts say Symantec's acquisition spree could go on. Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) are also viewed as companies that could be looking to make acquisitions.IBD's Computer-Software Security group ranks No. 148 out of 197 industry groups. Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE) report earnings after the market close Thursday.RELATED:

248,SYMC,"Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is well-positioned if the security software market consolidates amid a slowdown in corporate spending, says Jefferies, which hiked its price target on Check Point stock.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci increased his price target on Check Point to 118 from 110.""As the pioneer of important firewall technology that provides the cornerstone of its platform, Check Point is well positioned for a consolidating IT security market,"" said DiFucci in his research report. ""Moderating security industry growth will affect most vendors, including Check Point, and while there remain uncertainties around the cloud, CHKP's bias toward enterprises and the data center/cloud perimeter should at least partially offset these potential headwinds.""DiFucci, who published an in-depth report on the security market, has buy ratings on Mimecast (MIME), Varonis (VRNS) and Splunk (SPLK) and hold ratings on Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Symantec (SYMC).IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Computer-Software Security group ranks just No. 157 out of 197 industry groups. The group fell 16% in 2016, but it's up in 2017, in part on expectations that M&A activity will pick up. CyberArk Software has the group's highest Composite Rating.

Check Point stock finished 0.9% lower at 89.61 on the stock market today, but it's up 7% in 2017 and hit a 16-year high of 92.23 on Friday. Check Point stock is back in a buy range after breaking out of a cup-with-handle formation at 85.95 on Dec. 16.After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat-detection technologies. The shift of IT infrastructure to the cloud has many companies reassessing spending priorities, analysts say.""Corporations are overwhelmed with the plethora of seemingly endless technologies required to protect their enterprise and now accept that consolidation of the solution is a legitimate and welcome alternative,"" added DiFucci in the report. ""Those vendors that can accomplish this as a contiguous platform play or those that can consolidate others' solutions should benefit.""In order to accomplish or even simply pursue this nirvana, vendors have to be willing to break out of their ""swim lanes"" to address adjacent technology needs ... . We believe we will likely see increased acquisitions of point solutions that are among best-of-breed.""RELATED:Could Microsoft Join Cisco In Hunt For Security Firms?Check Point, Rival Proofpoint Next Up For Security Company EarningsCisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity Shift

253,SYMC,"Samsung Electronics will boost shareholder returns and review its corporate structure, the South Korean titan said Tuesday adopting many of the reforms urged by activist fund Elliott Management.Samsung will return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through next year vs. its prior pledge to return 30%-50%. That implies a return of 9.5 trillion won ($8.1 billion). It will boost dividends by 30% in 2016 to a total of 4 trillion won, with the rest spend on share buybacks.Samsung has a dividend yield of about 1.3% vs. 2% at Apple (AAPL), 2.6% at Microsoft (MSFT) and 3.4% at IBM (IBM).The Korea corporate giant will spend the next six months reviewing the possibility of creating a holding company and listing on more exchanges.All that spells a partial victory for Elliott Management, led by billionair Paul Elliott Singer. Last October, Elliott Management urged a U.S. listing, a 30 trillion won special dividend and a split into an operating company and holding company. Elliott also proposed three independent directors on Samsung's board.Samsung is struggling with the fallout from its Note 7 smartphone overheating fiasco, which tarnished its image and left a product hole as Apple launched its iPhone 7, seen as an incremental not revolutionary handset advance. Samsung also is linked somewhat to an influence-peddling scandal that has engulfed President Park Geun-hye.Elliott Management has been busy, and successful, and spurring companies to boost shareholder value via cash returns or put themselves up for sale.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) leapt 7% on the stock market today after Elliott disclosed a 4% stake in the IT services firm. It wants Cognizant to buy back $2.5 billion in stock in the first half of 2017. Cognizant said it would review Elliott's letter.Earlier this month, chip design firm Mentor Graphics (MENT) accepted a $4.5 billion buyout from Germany's Siemens (SIEGY) after pressure from Elliott, which owns 8.1%.

254,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) will buy LifeLock (LOCK), which provides identity theft protection services, the companies said late Sunday, following media reports that a deal had been reached. Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) crashed following earnings after Monday's close.Symantec will pay $2.3 billion cash, or 24 a share, for LifeLock, the companies said in a statement. They expect the deal will close in the first quarter of 2017. That's a 16% premium to LifeLock's Friday close of 20.75. It's 36% more than LifeLock's share price when reports on Nov. 11 arose that the ID theft firm was mulling a sale.LifeLock rose nearly 15% to 23.81 on the stock market today.Symantec rose 3.2% to 24.52, but was unable to close above its 50-day moving average. The stock fell 5% last week amid buzz that Symantec was interested in LifeLock. Symantec is in a flat base with a 25.82 buy point.""As we all know, consumer cybercrime has reached crisis levels. LifeLock is a leading provider of identity and fraud protection services, with over 4.4 million highly-satisfied members and growing. With the combination of Norton and LifeLock, we will be able to deliver comprehensive cyber defense for consumers,"" said Greg Clark, Symantec's CEO.Symantec will combine LifeLock with Norton Security anti-virus to provide a broader consumer cybersecurity solution. Norton Security revenue has been falling as Symantec shifts from opt-out licenses to opt-in subscriptions.Elliott Management, which owns 11% of Lifelock, had urged the company to explore buyout bids.Symantec reiterated its fiscal 2017 and 2018 adjusted EPS guidance, predicting that the deal will boost profit in FY 2019.Symantec apparently beat out various private equity firms for LifeLock.

Proofpoint rose 1% to 87.44 at the close, but was trading near 66 following Palo Alto's results.CyberArk Software (CYBR) is working on a cup base, finding support at its 200-day line in late October and early November. Since then it's been building the right side of a consolidation, with a buy point of 59.38. CyberArk advanced 0.3% to 54.62 at the close, but dipped to around 53 in late trade.RELATED:Black Friday, Apple, Sina, Weibo In Focus For Investing Action PlanIf Trump Bump Holds, Will Palo Alto, Cybersecurity Stocks Rise?

258,SYMC,"Security software stocks sold off Tuesday on Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) disappointing earnings and Goldman Sachs' downgrade of FireEye (FEYE) to sell based on a weak 2017 outlook.Shares of Palo Alto Networks tumbled 13% to a nearly three-month low, while FireEye skidded 5.5% in the stock market today.Palo Alto Networks blamed its miss for the quarter ended Oct. 31 partly on a longer sales cycle and large deals that did not close in the quarter, some of which it said have since been booked. Last month, Fortinet (FTNT) CEO Ken Xie cited ""a moderated spending environment, extended sales cycles and sales execution challenges"" as impacting his company's Q3 results.Among other security software leaders, CyberArk Software (CYBR) stock fell 3.1%, Proofpoint (PFPT) 2.9%, and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) a fraction. Proofpoint's fall, though, put it back into buy range from an 80.77 buy point first touched on Nov. 10.Barracuda Networks (CUDA) stock fell just a fraction, though, and Fortinet bucked the trend, rising 1.6%.Symantec (SYMC), which earlier this week agreed to buy LifeLock, rose 2.4% to 25.11, above its 50-day line and approaching a buy point of 25.82.IBD's 25 company Computer Software-Security industry group fell 3.2% Tuesday, falling below its 50-day support line. It was the second-worst performer among IBD's 197 groups. Telecom-Infrastructure, with Dycom Industries (DY) plunging 20% on an earnings miss, was the worst.IBD'S TAKE: The Computer-Software Security group ranks just No. 86 out of 197 industry groups. IBD's Sector Leaders features growth stocks among some better groups, stocks such as Western Alliance Bancorp, Inphi, Essent Group and Gigamon.""A second quarter in a row of deteriorating growth likely puts Palo Alto into the penalty box,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a research report. ""However, we still see the company as best positioned to benefit from increasing consolidation of spend in the security space,"" added Weiss, who maintained an overweight rating on Palo Alto Networks.Meanwhile, Gabriela Borges, a Goldman Sachs analyst, downgraded FireEye to sell from neutral.""We recognize that FireEye is taking significant action with product positioning and cost optimization to improve its long-term growth prospects,"" said Borges in her report. ""However, we expect fundamentals to remain pressured in 2017 owing to changes in customer buying patterns, and we believe that FireEye's strategy to move into the midmarket will be difficult to execute.""After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade security technology.That uptick in ""crisis spending"" drove security software stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015 as valuations soared. Price competition has intensified among providers following a moderation of security spending in late 2015 and into 2016. Cisco Systems (CSCO) push into the security market has also pressured margins, analysts say.One issue, analysts say, is that companies are digesting new technologies acquired the past few years. Some corporate customers are shifting to cloud computing infrastructure, and are reassessing spending priorities. Palo Alto has forecast a pickup in security spending by the latter half of 2017.RELATED:Proofpoint 'Continues To Separate From Security Pack' As Q3 BeatsGrowth-Needy Cisco Aiming To Be Top Dog In Security Vs.

Because the stock debuted Sept. 21 on the Nasdaq, it doesn't yet have a 50-day moving average. But daily dollar volume is more than $20 million, an amount that suggests institutional participation.Trade Desk is a digital ad company. The company grew earnings 100% to 20 cents a share in Q2, on a year-ago basis. In Q3, earnings increased 71% to 24 cents a share. The Street expects earnings to check in at 88 cents a share, a 105% increase, in full year 2016. But 2017 earnings are expected to dip 3%.Strength among IPOs is a good sign for the stock market. Since Jan. 1, the IBD New Issues Index is up 7.3%.Meanwhile, blue chip winners outpaced losers by a 3-1 ratio. The biggest gainer on the 30-stock Dow was IBM (IBM), which rose 1.6% in average volume.

The stock has an EPS Rating of 38, which means 62% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top rated stocks, advancing issues led losers by a 7-to-2 ratio.

Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), the largest by market capitalization, was up less than 2% after sinking 9.5% Thursday.CBS (CBS) climbed 3%, rising back above the 56.95 buy point of a cup with handle base in active trading. The broadcaster beat profit and sales expectations late Thursday. Adjusted earnings rose 19% to $1.05 a share. Revenue of $3.4 billion rose 4%.

266,SYMC,"Growth-needy Cisco Systems (CSCO) will likely make it a lot tougher on rival security-software providers — at least before it buys more of them.Amid Cisco's disappointing revenue outlook for fiscal Q2 late Wednesday, security remains a bright spot. Cisco's security revenue in its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 29 rose 11% from the year-earlier quarter, to about $540 million. Security revenue was flat from the previous quarter, though.Cisco, the longtime leader in networking gear, aims to take share vs. security software leaders Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), FireEye (FEYE) and other security software rivals. Price competition is likely to intensify in corporate firewalls and other areas.""Cisco security continues to grow with the firewall market (if not potentially better) making it tougher for competitors, especially the more recent challengers in the market, to take share,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco stock is up nearly 16% in 2016, owing in part to its dividend. Rival Arista Networks is No. 13 in the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks. Learn more on Arista at IBD Stock Checkup.On Cisco's fiscal Q1 earnings conference call, management said the company added 5,300 new customers for its next-generation firewall offering, bringing its total to over 62,000, with revenue for that product growing 35%.""Palo Alto reports results on Nov. 21,"" added Pritchard, ""which based on Cisco's strength likely mutes potential upside as Cisco security continues to show stability and hold on to more installations."" The Citigroup analyst says Cisco could also be pressuring Fortinet.Cisco acquired Sourcefire for $2.7 billion in 2013. More recent purchases include OpenDNS, Lancope and CloudLock. Pritchard and other analysts have viewed FireEye as a potential Cisco target.""We're the only company with security product revenue exceeding $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth,"" Cisco CEO Charles Robbins said on the call.Check Point's quarterly revenue recently topped $428 million, with Palo Alto at about $400 million. Fortinet had quarterly revenue of $316 million, with FireEye at $186 million and Proofpoint (PFPT) at $100 million. Symantec (SYMC) has an annual run-rate of over $2 billion, but that includes nonsecurity products. IBM (IBM) also has sizable security software and services revenue.""We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100%, as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%,"" added Robbins on the call.Cisco said fiscal Q1 earnings per share minus items rose 3% to 61 cents from the year-earlier period. Revenue slipped 3% to $12.4 billion. Analysts had modeled EPS minus items of 59 cents on revenue of $12.33 billion.For the current quarter, Cisco forecast non-GAAP EPS of 56 cents. It forecast a revenue drop of 3% at the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts had projected 59 cents and $12.15 billion.

267,SYMC,"Apple (AAPL) approached a buy point and most of the FANG stocks rose modestly Wednesday, now six weekdays since the surprise presidential election of Donald Trump — who has had some pointed criticism for the tech industry — sent big tech stocks tumbling before modestly rebounding the past two days.In fact, Apple and the other large FANG internets — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — had started falling at least two weeks before Election Day (except for Google-owner Alphabet, whose downturn began Oct. 28). All four FANGs had been trading at or near all-time highs, but mixed earnings for Apple, Amazon and Alphabet weighed on the group.But after the election, a sector rotation ensued, with industries such as drugs and banks getting a lift from Trump's win, and techs, alternative-energy and other arenas getting hit.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest tech companies, of course, aren't necessarily the best tech stocks for investors at any given time. Which techs are best? There are tons of opinions and answers when asking that question, but a good source to put on your checklist is IBD's Tech Leaders.But Trump's election-campaign views and expected priorities have good as well as bad connotations for tech industries.William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri summed it up in a research note Wednesday:""Overall, we believe his views on global trade, net neutrality and internet privacy, and immigration could have negative consequences for technology companies, but his tax plan (including reducing the repatriation tax rate to 10%) would be a net positive given the large amount of foreign cash that many technology companies possess.""Trump's repatriation tax plan could bring big bucks back to the U.S. for the top five companies with overseas holdings. Besides Apple and Alphabet, the top five include Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).In his note, Suri was not shy about pointing out what Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle might target with that cash. Microsoft, he said, might go after ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO) or Symantec (SYMC). Cisco he sees eyeing FireEye (FEYE), Gigamon (GIMO) and F5 Networks (FFIV). Oracle, he says, might take a run at Veeva Systems (VEEV) or Tableau Software (DATA).In the meantime, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix rose for a second straight day. Facebook was the only decliner, falling 0.73% to 116.34, after touching a more than four-month low of 113.55 on Monday.Apple was the big gainer of the bunch on Wednesday, rising 2.7% to 110.04. That was easily its best day since Trump's win, marking its biggest percentage gain since Sept. 14. It is nearing a 118.79 buy point out of a flat base.Netflix stock rose a fraction to 115.17. It's forming a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 129.40.Shares of Alphabet and Amazon rose 0.62% and 0.39%, respectively.RELATED:Apple, FANGs Stop The Bleeding Post-Trump

""We continued to see strong sales of our SandBlast, Zero-Day Protection solutions, resulting in triple-digit growth as customers focus on prevention.""The company reported sales of $428 million and EPS ex items of $1.13, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $1.08 and $423 million. Q4 guidance for EPS ex items and for sales also beat analyst consensus, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research note.Year-over-year sales growth of 6%, however, was the smallest since Q4 2014, and the 8.7% growth in earnings per share minus items was the smallest rise since Q1 2014. UBS analyst Brent Thill, in a research report this month, said the software cybersecurity industry has been benefiting from a ""binge-buying"" growth mode after high-profile breaches at Target (TGT) and elsewhere, but that this ""supercycle"" was ending.IBD'S TAKE: The security group doesn't rank highly at the moment, but to learn about things like the CASB (cloud access security broker) market — where the players include Check Point, keep tabs on the IBD Industry Snapshot, which looks at the hot and potentially hot industry groups.After a slew of high-profile data breaches, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat detection technologies. ""We expect the next stage of the spending cycle to intensify competitively, where incumbents — namely perimeter security vendors — are likely to contend with greater discounting tactics,"" Thill wrote at that time.On Monday, though, William Blair's Ho said Check Point's Q3 ""product outperformance was driven by strong adoption of the company's next-generation firewalls ... .""""While the environment remains competitive, we believe Check Point can continue to sustain market share when factoring in the revenue impact from the shift from product revenue to subscription revenue,"" Ho said in his research report, maintaining an outperform rating on Check Point stock.Check Point is No. 1 in firewalls, according to tech research firm Gartner, and also in unified threat management, or UTM.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security group has rebounded from a big dip early this year, but it's down about 8% for the year and ranks just No. 51 out of 197 groups.Proofpoint (PFPT) is one of the top-rated companies in the group, and its earning beat on Oct. 20 lifted cybersecurity stocks. Its focus is on data loss and email protection, competing more directly with companies such as Symantec (SYMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) rather than Check Point.Check Point stock rose 4.4% in the stock market today, to 84.56, hitting a four-month-plus high.

CyberArk stock jumped 6.4% in the stock market today to 47.80. The IBD Software-Security group, however, dipped a fraction as tech stocks retreated once again.Symantec said earnings per share minus items for its fiscal Q2 ended Sept. 30 rose 3% to 30 cents, well ahead of the 20 cents analysts expected. But sales of $979 million only met expetations, and its EPS ex items guidance for fiscal Q3 of 27-29 cents was a shade less than the 30 cents analysts had modeled.The company also said CFO Thomas Seifert had resigned and would be replaced by Nick Noviello, CFO of recent acquisition Blue Coat Systems.Symantec stock was down 1.7% in after-hours trading, after its release.FireEye beat on the top and bottom lines, and with its Q4 guidance, sending its shares up 14% after hours. The company said it cut its per-share loss minus items to 16 cents from 37 cents in Q3 2015, as sales rose 13% to $186.4 million.Analyst had modeled a 31-cent per-share loss on revenue of $182.6 million.For Q4, FireEye guided to per-share loss minus items of 16-18 cents, where analysts had estimated a 20-cent loss.Imperva said Q3 revenue rose 7.9% to $68.4 million, where analyts had modeled $63.2 million.

Learn more about other industries where spending is projected to grow, such as fiber-optical network gear, at IBD Sector Leaders.Late Tuesday, Fortinet management said Q3 results were negatively impacted by sales execution issues in North America, macroeconomic pressure in the U.K. and Latin America, and longer sales cycles in the enterprise and service provider markets.But security vendor Barracuda Networks (CUDA) late Tuesday reported better-than-expected results. And tech research firm IDC on Wednesday said  worldwide revenue for security-related hardware, software, and services would grow from $73.7 billion in 2016 to $101.6 billion in 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 8.3% that it said is more than twice the expected rate of overall IT spending growth in that span.Barracuda Networks stock was up 8.4% in afternoon trading Wednesday, touching a one-year high intraday.Proofpoint reports its Q3 earnings on Oct. 20., which might be the next indicator of trends in the security market.Some analysts speculate that Cisco and Palo Alto Networks have gained share vs. Fortinet. Privately-held security software firms also have been gaining share, analysts say.Fortinet late Tuesday said it expects Q3 earnings per share minus items of 15 cents to 16 cents a share, compared with its prior guidance of 17 cents to 18 cents. It lowered revenue guidance to $311 million-$316 million from $319 million-$324 million. Fortinet lowered Q3 billings guidance by 8%.Morgan Stanley downgraded Fortinet to equal weight, while at least six other Wall Street firms lowered their price targets.Fortinet competes in the data center and government markets. Telecom companies are also big customers.After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat detection technologies. Firewalls block unauthorized traffic from entering a private network.Corporate spending on security appears to have slowed as more companies outsource business workloads to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN).""Given the Fortinet results, we are incrementally more cautious on the firewall market but not the overall security market,"" said Matthew Hedberg, an RBC Capital analyst, in a research report. ""Ultimately, we are more concerned that share gains for firewall vendors could be harder to come by these days, as many vendors in the space end up competing on price.""To us, Cisco has cleaned up its execution and Palo Alto has the opportunity to consolidate spending in the firewall space.""Gabriela Borges, a Goldman Sachs analyst, maintained a buy rating on Fortinet. ""We continue to believe Fortinet is well positioned to gain share and outgrow peers, and we see the potential for a capital allocation, restructuring, or M&A event (given 20% of its market cap is in cash),"" she wrote in a report.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a report that price cutting among security software firms has intensified, with relatively new entrant Cisco being aggressive.But Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski, in his research note, said some security vendors are doing well.""Based on a recent round of channel checks, we believe the issues Fortinet experienced are company-specific,"" he wrote. ""We noted strong demand for Palo Alto and modestly improved results for Check Point.""William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho, however, said corporate America is rethinking security priorities amid the shift to cloud computing.""Fortinet's commentary around a slowing spending environment undergoing more digestion and more strategic spending are consistent with other vendors comments regarding the market environment,"" Ho said in a report. ""We continue to see robust growth from private companies that may be capturing more mind share, as well as planning pauses tied to a structural shift from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud.""RELATED:Cisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity ShiftPalo Alto Networks 'Deceleration' Worries Investors; Stock Down

276,SYMC,"Barracuda Networks (CUDA) late Tuesday reported fiscal Q2 profit and revenue that topped views, but Fortinet (FTNT) preannounced a Q3 miss, sending shares of the security software vendors in opposite directions in after-hours trading.Barracuda said fiscal Q2 non-GAAP EPS, minus items, jumped 110% to 21 cents from the year earlier period. Revenue rose 12% to $87.9 million in the three months ended Aug. 30, the company said. Analysts had projected 13 cents per share profit and revenue of $85 million.Shares of Campbell, Calif.-based Barracuda was up 7% in after-hours trading Tuesday. During the regular session, the stock fell 3% in the stock market today.Barracuda did not provide guidance in its earnings release. For the current fiscal Q3, analysts estimate 7% revenue year-over-year growth to $85 million, and EPS growth of 68% to 12 cents.Barracuda focuses and small and medium-sized businesses. It has been transitioning to cloud-based security from network appliances.""We continue to innovate and bring new solutions to market that fortify the security fabric across public, private and hybrid cloud deployments and can be centrally managed from a single pane of glass,"" Barracuda CEO BJ Jenkins said in the company's earnings statement. ""We believe Barracuda is well positioned to build on our momentum and be a market leader in our targeted focus areas as customers look to adopt new application and network deployment models and move workloads to the cloud.""IBD'S TAKE: Corporate spending on security has been growing at about a 6% annual rate while IT budgets have been flattish. Some companies are reassessing security spending amid a shift to cloud computing. Cisco Systems is likely to continue buying security firms and M&A has been a driver of security stocks over the years.  Barracuda has ramped up email protection and next-generation firewalls that support Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, the leading cloud computing services. Barracuda also provides support for Microsoft's Office 365 cloud products.Rival Fortinet has shifted its focus to the SMB market, where Symantec (SYMC) and U.K.-based Sophos Group also compete.Fortinet late Tuesday said it expects EPS ex items of 15-16 cents for Q3, where it had guided to 17-18 cents, and it sees revenue of $311 million to $316 million where it had guided to $319-$324 million. It is slated to release full Q3 earnings after the close Oct. 27.""Our third-quarter results were primarily impacted by the lengthening of deal cycles as enterprises are becoming more strategic with their purchasing decisions and buying with less urgency than last year,"" Fortinet CEO said in a statement. ""We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and long-term growth opportunity, and committed to delivering returns to our shareholders.""The company also said directors had authorized a $100 million increase to its existing share repurchase program, bringing the amount authorized under the current program to $300 million. During Q3, the company said it repurchased $25 million of common stock.Fortinet stock was down 13% in after-hours trading, after the announcement.RELATED:Cisco, Palo Alto, Symantec Gear Up For Cloud Cybersecurity ShiftFortinet Upgraded On Profitability; Imperva Tanks On Lacking Suitors

279,SYMC,"Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski was bullish Tuesday on No. 1 cybersecurity firm Symantec (SYMC), which he says could grow earnings by 12%-14% beyond fiscal 2018 even without new acquisition Blue Coat Systems.With Blue Coat, though, Symantec could hurdle its $1.70-$1.80 view for fiscal 2018 earnings per share ex items. That forecast doesn't account for Symantec's $4.7 billion Blue Coat buy, Nowinski wrote in a research report.The consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Symantec hitting $1.73 EPS ex items in fiscal 2018, ending on or near April 1, 2018, up 54.5% from the $1.12 view for fiscal 2017. Symantec's fiscal 2017 will include three quarters of Blue Coat impact. That deal closed Aug. 1.IBD'S TAKE: Symantec is No. 1 in terms of market share among its cybersecurity rivals, but CyberArk Software has an industry-topping IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks. Still, CyberArk's sales beats are getting smaller.Symantec expects to cut $150 million in operating expenses as it exits fiscal 2018. Those cuts will come from eliminating Blue Coat's administration expenses and Kaspersky Labs' threat intelligence feed, and consolidating cloud-infrastructure buildouts.But the primary synergy will be in cross-selling opportunities to Symantec's 370,000 and Blue Coat's 15,000 enterprise bases. Symantec expects to sell Blue Coat's secure web gateway into its base and its data loss prevention solution into Blue Coat's base.In the enterprise segment, Symantec added 115 customers in fiscal Q1 ended July 1 to its advanced threat protection offering, bringing the total up to 270. It also expects renewal rates to improve on an auto-renew function in the U.S. and abroad.Further stoking the enterprise segment, Symantec expects to launch enhancements to its ATP suite in October, including a machine-learning function. On the consumer side, Symantec has plans for new Wi-Fi privacy, identity protection and Internet of Things product launches.Nowinski has an overweight rating and 27 price target on Symantec stock. On the stock market today, Symantec stock rose 0.55% to 23.87. Shares are up 40% for the year even as IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security group is down 8%.RELATED:

280,SYMC,"FireEye (FEYE) is more likely to be acquired in the wake of company founder and tech visionary Ashar Aziz resigning from the company's board of directors, says Nomura Securities.FireEye stock closed 0.1% lower in the stock market today, and it's down 60% in the past year. But after hours, shares rose 1.6%.In a regulatory filing Wednesday, the computer software security firm said that Aziz had resigned from the board effective Aug. 31.""With the loss of the company's founder, we believe this could position FireEye as a more willing seller,"" said  Nomura analyst Frederick Grieb in a research report.IBD's Computer Software-Security group ranks No. 24 out of 197 industry groups, way up from No. 164 just eight weeks ago.Companies on the prowl for security acquisitions, analysts say, might include Dell Technologies, the new name for the company created by Dell's just-completed acquisition of EMC; security vendor Symantec (SYMC); and network gear leader Cisco Systems (CSCO), which is focusing more on security.IBD's TAKE: FireEye's stock has been falling since mid-2015. Top-ranked security stocks include CyberArk Software, a member of IBD's Leaderboard and the IBD 50; Proofpoint, another takeover candidate; and Barracuda Networks.Aziz founded Milpitas, Calif.-based FireEye in 2004. FireEye in August announced a restructuring plan, including a sales shake-up. In May, the company named a new CEO, Kevin Mandia.""The (security) market is becoming crowded, and given the company's operating losses and a very specialized product, we believe that FireEye may look to evaluate its strategic options more readily,"" added Nomura's Grieb in the report.RELATED:CyberArk Topples On $10 Million Billings Lag, Smallest Ever Beat

281,SYMC,"Proofpoint (PFPT) isn't your daddy's spam protector.The highly-rated cybersecurity firm jumped to the cloud in 2008. And within three years of its April 2012 initial public offering, Proofpoint launched social and mobile products that, today, are swiping share from rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Symantec (SYMC).CEO Gary Steele credits Proofpoint's nimble nature, which he says hasn't changed since it was a venture capital-backed Silicon Valley newbie in 2002 with 10 employees. Now, Proofpoint boasts more than 1,300 staffers.""In a world where you're in an ongoing war against bad actors, we have to be nimble and responsive to the changes we see in the marketplace,"" he told IBD. ""And I think that's one of the things that has truly distinguished the company.""Proofpoint on Friday cleared a 76.93 buy point from a short consolidation, climbing 0.9% to 77.20 on the stock market Friday, but in light volume. Proofpoint rose 0.4% to 77.50 in Monday trade in above-average volume.Proofpoint stock has surged 19% year to date, outplaying IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group, down nearly 8%. But the group, too, is seeing a resurgence and ranks No. 30 out of 197 industries tracked, up from No. 191 over 13 weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Proofpoint is ranked No. 4 in IBD's security software group. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find the top three cybersecurity stocks -- and how they stack up vs. Proofpoint.That's because cybersecurity spending is taking a larger-than-expected chunk of total IT spending, Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick says. Panic spending forced valuations to rocket in 2015 and the first half of 2016 couldn't keep up.But the second half is turning out to be a different story, Trebnick told IBD.""You're seeing in IT spending, security is still a No. 1 priority,"" she said. ""And in this whole security area, email is the No. 1 threat vector. It's also the place where people feel they have control over their network.""And that's where Proofpoint is winning, she says.Proofpoint got its start as a spam-blocker. But today's hackers are less interested in selling a ""Rolex"" and more interested in credential theft. Thus, social engineering is at the heart of most attacks.Such was the case in February and March when Seagate Technology (STX) and Snapchat were duped into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms. Seagate's breach came down to a phishing attack whereas Snapchat was duped by a spoofed email.Both are nascent email cons. Phishing emails contain legitimate-sounding requests for information. Spoofing changes a key figure in an email address. So in Snapchat's case, CEO Evan Spiegel's last name could have been spelled with the number 1.""The email threat vector is really vulnerable,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski told IBD. ""It's easier to trick a human into clicking a link than it is to write sophisticated malware.""Since January 2015, businesses lost a collective $3.1 billion in email compromise schemes across the globe, the FBI found. Last year, 30% of targeted people opened a malicious email, according to a recent Verizon study.Proofpoint's targeted attack protection (TAP) aims to solve that equation by filtering out malware-ridden emails before they arrive in the inbox. And for spear-phishing and spoofing, last Wednesday Proofpoint announced the $18 million acquisition of Return Path's email fraud protection business.Last year, industry tracker Gartner predicted TAP, data loss prevention and encryption would continue driving secure email gateway (SEG) growth. Overall, the SEG segment is expected to sustain 2%-4% growth annually over the next several years.""The SEG market is mature. The penetration rate of commercial SEG solutions is close to 100% of enterprises,"" Gartner wrote. ""Despite the market maturity, companies can't do without SEG solutions. ... Despite the low overall growth, we do see individual vendors that are taking market share.""A Piper Jaffray survey of resellers found Proofpoint is most often beating out Cisco and Symantec, with FireEye's (FEYE) on-premises solution trailing, Nowinski told IBD. Mimecast (MIME), which filed its IPO last year, targets small and midsize businesses (SMBs), while Proofpoint's focus is larger companies and enterprises.Proofpoint is outgrowing Cisco and Symantec. In 2015, Proofpoint grew its sales 31%, leading 16% growth in Cisco's security segment. Symantec shrank 10%, though its Blue Coat Systems acquisition will likely help it grow this year.""Cisco is really pushing their security angle,"" Dougherty's Trebnick said. ""They're trying to establish a bundle, but I wouldn't say they have any new function or features. Only Proofpoint and Mimecast have whaling (spoofing) detection. ... Cisco is late to the game.""The proof is in the pudding for Proofpoint, Rosenblatt analyst Marshall Senk said in an Aug. 1 research report. During Q2, Proofpoint hit ""an inflection point,"" crushing Wall Street's sales, earnings, billings and free cash flow projections, and hitting profitability two quarters ahead of time.Revenue growth accelerated for a second straight quarter, to 41%, its best gain in seven quarters.Beyond that, Proofpoint expects to hit $1 billion in annual sales by 2020. To do that, the company would have to maintain a 20%-32% compound annual growth rate. Since 2013, Proofpoint has grown an average 37% annually. Sales have grown by more than a third for the past 11 quarters.It's also beaten sales expectations by an average of 4.3% for the past eight quarters. It has met or topped EPS minus items views for the last seven of eight quarters. Nowinski credits Proofpoint's keen forecasting skill to the fact 97% of its sales stem from subscriptions.""The average contract length is between 15 and 22 months,"" he said. ""They have two years of visibility already from all the contracts they've been signing.""Perhaps the biggest tailwinds for Proofpoint stem from cooperation. Earlier this summer, Proofpoint announced partnerships with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Splunk (SPLK), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Imperva (IMPV) for technical integration.The partnerships open Proofpoint up to nonoverlapping customer bases like Palo Alto Networks' 26,000 customers, Wells Fargo analyst Gary Powell wrote in a July 25 research report. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) McAfee is obsoleting its services and recommending customers to Proofpoint.Nowinski models an $80 million to $100 million McAfee opportunity for Proofpoint. Steele wouldn't put a dollar-figure on the potential windfall. Dougherty's Trebnick expects it to be a five-year push.On top of that, the transition to Microsoft (MSFT) Office 365 adds another three- to four-year charge. Microsoft launched its cloud-based Office 365 in 2011. But only about 13% of all publicly listed firms have made the switch to cloud-based office systems, Trebnick says. It has online threat protection built in, and offers sandboxing on its enterprise model, but doesn't include spoofing protection.""CIOs (chief information officers) say that there's too much latency with (Microsoft's) new products, so they'd rather choose the (enterprise) version with either the Mimecast piece of it or install the Proofpoint piece,"" she said. ""They work in conjunction.""RELATED:Palo Alto Seen Tightening 2017 Guidance On Cisco RivalryProofpoint Battens Against Spoofers, Phishers With $18 Million BuyProofpoint Hits Stratosphere On EPS Beat, First-Ever ProfitCisco Tests Palo Alto, Check Point; CyberArk, Proofpoint Niches Safe

284,SYMC,"The median salary for a cybersecurity job is 2.7 times that of average wages in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., yet 82% of organizations in those countries are experiencing a shortage in skilled cybersecurity workers, chipmaker Intel (INTC) found in a poll by its Intel Security business.More than half (53%) of respondents say the cybersecurity skills shortage is worse than talent deficits in other IT professions.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski agrees. Cybersecurity firms ""can't hire people fast enough,"" he told IBD.A major challenge is that cybersecurity jobs require much more than a degree and applicable coding abilities, says Candace Worley, vice president of enterprise solutions marketing for Intel Security. Some of the best cybersecurity workers, she says, have hacking backgrounds, a skill with a questionable reputation in the industry. But it's a skill she calls crucial.IBD'S TAKE: Most stocks make their biggest gains fairly early in their publicly-traded lives, so IBD's IPO Leaders list is worth tracking. Security firm CyberArk Software is on the current list, making its IPO in September 2014 at $16 a share and now trading near 55.""Computer science and math degrees provide a certain intellectual skill set, but (they) don't necessarily hone the hunting and detective skills required for this industry,"" Worley told IBD. ""Coding, incident response ... there are a lot of skills required to play in the cybersecurity space.""Over the course of May, Intel Security teamed up with market research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey security staff at 775 companies and other organizations of 500-plus employees, in eight countries.Some jobs are especially hard to fill, Worley said. Jobs in intrusion detection, attack mitigation and software development -- creating software that is less susceptible to hacking -- are the ones that most often go begging, she says. Those skills are rarer than less-technical abilities like communications and management.To that point, Intel Security noted the highest technical security job last year in the U.S. paid $233,333 annually. That's $8,000 more than most chief information security officers (CISOs) make, according to job tracker Dice.Last year, the U.S. left 209,000 unfilled security jobs on the table, Intel said, citing a Peninsula Press analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That's about $41.8 billion in unpaid salaries, assuming a $200,000 average wage for each position. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (71%) say the shortage in skills left their organizations vulnerable to attack.The trend is continuing this year, but perhaps at a slower pace, according to Piper Jaffray's Nowinski. In June, there were 2,843 unfilled jobs at 13 cybersecurity firms in the U.S., according to job-postings information examined by Piper Jaffray. At, say, $200,000 a head, that's roughly $570 million in unfilled salaries. Among those with the most total open positions were KEYW Corp. (KEYW) (658), Fortinet (FTNT) (459) and Symantec (SYMC) (431).Overall, however, the number of unfilled positions at those 13 firms fell 28% in June vs. June 2015, and they fell 25% in May vs. a year earlier. In April, though, the number of unfilled jobs had risen 14%.Nowinski credits the fewer unfilled posts in June and May not just to companies filling slots, but also to some layoffs. Such was likely the case for Symantec. It had 71% fewer technical job openings this June vs. June 2015, but in May it announced 1,200 layoffs.""Cybersecurity firms can't hire people fast enough,"" he said.Networking companies such as Brocade Communications (BRCD), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) can fill technical jobs more easily because the required skills are similar, Nowinski says. ""But (jobs at) Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and) Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) are all vastly different,"" requiring multiple specialists, he said.Organizations aren't all on the same page in terms of hiring practices, says Intel's Worley. The lion's share of respondents (68%) to the survey say hands-on experience is critical to developing cybersecurity skills. And though more than half require at least a bachelor's degree, 23% say education isn't properly preparing students.There is a lack of master's programs for cybersecurity, says Tim Ashford, IT director for Ashford Capital Management, an independent research and analysis firm. Ashford is working toward his master's of science in information security engineering with the SANS Institute.The SANS Institute provides cybersecurity training for more than 165,000 security professionals worldwide, and it offers two cybersecurity master's programs. Two summers ago, Ashford, a 19-year veteran of the IT industry, began looking for cybersecurity programs.""I hit up websites like MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Stanford (University) and saw courses here and there, but as far as programs for preparing people with hacking techniques, managed qualitative skills, I saw next to none of that,"" he told IBD.In December 2014, the SANS Institute had just six graduates of its program, Ashford says. But breaches like those of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and LinkedIn (LNKD), dating back to 2013, have spiked interest, he says. Like Worley, he says there's a need for cybersecurity professionals who can ""break stuff.""Also like Worley, Ashford cites a need to reach younger minds.""You've got to find a way to get kids to think about cyber,"" Ashford said. ""It's part deconstruction, breaking things down. But there's always a delicate risk with kids. Let's teach them how to break stuff, but also educate them on the heart and soul of cybersecurity.""Workers at cybersecurity companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Check Point and Fortinet try to hunt down the origins of a breach, close it and then remedy the potential fallout.""That takes ability to deduct, it takes problem-solving, and it takes logic,"" Worley said. ""We're unlikely to see a decline in hacking and malware, so we're seeing the industry work with high schools and universities to build the curriculum.""Government also has a role to play. But 76% of respondents say their governments aren't investing enough in cybersecurity talent, and the same percentage say the laws and regulations surrounding security infrastructure in their nations are insufficient.In the U.S., Obama has pledged $19 billion for fiscal 2017, which starts Oct. 1, to bolster the government's aging security infrastructure. That could boost spending, but Piper Jaffray's Nowinski says that won't necessarily produce more qualified folks to fill cybersecurity jobs.Yet, 9 in 10 respondents say technology can help organizations fill the hole in skilled security workers. More than half (55%) say technology like automation and managed security service offerings will advance sufficiently in five years to meet the majority of a firm's security needs.Worley isn't as bullish on the rapid advance of security automation, but she says the idea is getting greater acceptance. Automation is a relatively nascent tool, relying on supercomputers like IBM's (IBM) Watson to hunt needle-in-the-haystack security abnormalities or automate update deployments.""If you go back a decade, most people were extremely uncomfortable with automation,"" she said. ""But now, and most companies are more tolerant of automation.""Still, she emphasized, ""skills that require significant analysis will continue to require human intervention.""RELATED:

285,SYMC,"Proofpoint (PFPT) is displacing Symantec (SYMC) and Intel (INTC) McAfee as headline-making breaches like that of the Democratic National Committee drive its $10 billion thesis, Summit Redstone analyst Srini Nandury said Tuesday.Nandury relaunched coverage of Proofpoint stock with a buy rating and a 90 price target, calling email security the ""biggest threat vector"" for the industry. There, Proofpoint competes with the likes of Symantec, FireEye (FEYE) and Mimecast (MIME).IBD'S TAKE: Resellers in a Piper Jaffray survey say Proofpoint is displacing Cisco Systems, Intel, Symantec, FireEye and Mimecast in the email segment.A ""constant barrage"" of high-profile breaches has helped Proofpoint top sales views by an average 5% for the past 18 quarters, Nandury wrote in a research report. Its email and social media security, privacy and archiving products rank high in the industry.""Not surprisingly, the company has been taking share from incumbents,"" he wrote. Among those, he identified Symantec and Intel. Intel's security arm is phasing out its email service and recommending customers to Proofpoint.Industry tracker IDC pegs the Intel opportunity at $92 million, but Nandury sees $200 million to $300 million given the cross-selling opportunity for Proofpoint's targeted attack protection (TAP), archiving, privacy, governance and emerging products.Only 46% of Proofpoint customers use multiple products, meaning the company has a massive runway for growth, Nandury wrote. It could also expand internationally. The U.S. accounts for 82% of Proofpoint's sales today.""Proofpoint is addressing and large and growing (total addressable market) of $10 billion by 2019, up from the $5 billion TAM quoted at its (initial public offering) in April 2012,"" Nandury wrote. ""With only 4% market penetration, Proofpoint has a long runway for growth.:For 2017, Nandury models 30% growth. During its June analyst day in San Francisco, Proofpoint guided to 28%-32% growth over the next three years. Proofpoint has grown at a 35% compound annual growth rate since its IPO in 2012.Proofpoint stock closed down 0.55% at 75.68  on the stock market today.

286,SYMC,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) is expected late Tuesday to report decelerating Q2 sales that, for the eighth consecutive quarter, still grow by at least a third vs. the year-earlier period as the broader industry struggles with tough 2015 comparisons.Shares of CyberArk fell 1.1% to 55.59 on the stock market today. Shares are up 23% for the year, as IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group has fallen about 10%.IBD'S TAKE: CyberArk stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it has performed in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of earnings power and sales growth. The company tops the Computer Software-Security industry group. Get more CyberArk data at the IBD Stock Checkup.For Q2, the consensus of 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects CyberArk to report $48.3 million in sales and 20 cents earnings per share ex items, up a respective 33% and 5% vs. last year.Under the forecast, sales would decelerate from 42% year-over-year growth in the prior two quarters, and EPS is expected to slow from seven consecutive quarters of at least double-digit growth. For the September quarter, sales are seen braking again as EPS falls vs. last year.CyberArk's earnings will follow Symantec (SYMC) and Imperva (IMPV). Last week, Symantec reported fiscal Q1 sales that fell 3%, but EPS ex items that grew 12%. For Q2, Imperva's sales grew 8%, slowing to single digits for the first time, with Imperva also reporting losses.Symantec's fiscal Q1 followed three days after the company's completed its acquisition of Blue Coat Systems for $4.65 billion. Symantec stock shot up as much as 9% after its fiscal Q1 report, before settling up 4%. Shares are up 35% since January.

287,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is displacing Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) to compete against Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick said Tuesday ahead of Palo Alto's fiscal Q4 earnings report, due out Aug. 30.But fears of deceleration are likely to come to fruition: Palo Alto is expected to report 37% year-over-year growth to $389.9 million in sales, slowing for the fourth straight quarter. It would be the first time its quarterly sales growth dipped below 40%.For its fiscal Q4 ended in July, analysts model Palo Alto bringing in 49 cents earnings per share ex items, up 75% vs. the year-earlier period. That's big growth, but that metric would also mark a deceleration for the fourth consecutive quarter.The consensus of 41 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Palo Alto to wrap up fiscal 2016 with $1.37 billion in sales and $1.66 EPS ex items, up 47% and 93%, respectively. It would be Palo Alto's first year topping $1 billion in sales and $1 EPS minus items.Palo Alto Networks stock is down 5% since its May 26 fiscal Q3 earnings release sent shares falling 12% the next day. For that quarter, product sales declined 4.6% sequentially, sparking concerns of a slowdown for blowout-earner Palo Alto. Meanwhile, IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group is up 9% in that span.""We believe investors will scrutinize product revenue performance on the (fiscal Q4) print, as many are looking for a rebound after (fiscal) Q3 when product revenue declined,"" Trebnick wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Palo Alto Networks stock is ranked eighth in its industry group. CyberArk Software stock tops its rivals, with an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks. The industry group is in an uptrend, ranked No. 41 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 191 one quarter ago. See IBD Stock Checkup to get a better handle on stocks.Palo Alto stock closed up 3.3% at 142.11 on the stock market today. Shares are down more than 20% for the year, though, underperforming Palo Alto's industry group, which is down 8%. Still, Trebnick is bullish on the company's upcoming fiscal Q4.""Our checks from industry professionals and resellers indicated that they experienced a robust performance domestically, offsetting bits of continued disruption abroad,"" she wrote. Namely, Palo Alto's fiscal Q4 will have a full month of Brexit impact, unlike the case for Check Point and Fortinet (FTNT).Competitively, Palo Alto is persisting against Check Point, Trebnick wrote. In a number of RFPs (requests for proposals), Palo Alto is edging out Check Point to become a finalist against Cisco and the incumbent, she said. And Palo Alto is withstanding Cisco's renewed firewall focus, she added.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski saw similar demand in a round of checks with resellers and distributors, who noted demand is up. Customers are working through end-of-2015 purchase digestion, Palo Alto still has a runway in Europe, and virtual firewall sales are increasing, he said.On the subscription side, Nowinski and Trebnick both expect keen demand for Palo Alto's Traps product, for endpoint security, and Aperture, its cloud access security broker (CASB). The latter competes with Symantec (SYMC) following the No. 1 cybersecurity firm's recent acquisition of Blue Coat Systems.Still, Traps and Aperture are seeing some challenges from privately held rivals, Dougherty's Trebnick wrote. Traps remains ""dwarfed"" in competitive deployments vs. Cylance and Crowdstrike, and Aperture isn't yet a challenge for CASB leaders Netskope and Skyhigh Networks.RELATED:Symantec Tops Views; FireEye Dives Late On Layoffs, OutlookHackers Playground: Security Lapse Cited By 82% Of Firms, Says Intel.

288,SYMC,"Cybersecurity companies Symantec (SYMC) and FireEye (FEYE) both reported earnings late Thursday, but one set of results was much more well-received by investors than the other.CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) also moved in late trade.Symantec, which has now completed the acquisition of Blue Coat, said revenue declined 3% to $884 million in Q1 2017, topping estimates for $877 million. Adjusted profit of 29 cents a share pulled ahead of views by 4 cents.And the company projected full-year 2017 guidance well above estimates. It sees $1.08-$1.14 in diluted EPS on $4.04 billion to $4.12 billion in revenue for the year vs. current consensus for $1.08 a share on $3.53 billion.For Q2, Symantec is guiding for 18 to 21 cents a share on $960 million to $990 million in sales vs. views for 26 cents EPS on $878.2 million.Shares perked up nearly 5% after hours after closing the day up 0.6% at 21.03 on the stock market today. Symantec likely will clear recent resistance Friday morning, possibly rising to its best levels since the end of 2004.Meanwhile, FireEye shares sank 16% in extended trade after news emerged that the company would cut 300 to 400 positions.""We'll do our best to go after infrastructure costs, discretionary spending and things like that, but unfortunately we will have to reduce employees as well,"" CFO Michael Berry told MarketWatch, which first reported the layoffs.The company reported a narrower-than-expected 33-cent-per-share loss but revenue growth that fell short of estimates for $181.7 million, up 19% to $175 million. That's by far the smallest revenue gain in at least the last four years.For 2016, FireEye said it now sees a per-share loss of $1.28 to $1.32 on revenue of $716 million to $728 million, down from prior guidance for a loss of $1.20 to $1.27 per share and revenue of $780 million to $810 million.That compares with analyst expectations for a $1.24 per-share loss and $793.7 million in revenue for the year.FireEye's Q3 guidance also fell short.CyberArk fell 3% in late trading after closing up 0.4% to 56.38. Palo Alto Networks dipped 1% after rising 1.4% to 131.44.

289,SYMC,"Social media leader Facebook (FB), electric car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA), 3D printer maker 3D Systems (DDD) and membership retailer Costco (COST) all had their price targets raised while coverage was initiated on Symantec (SYMC).Facebook had its price target raised to 170 by Jefferies, which maintained a buy rating. Last week, Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59%, and EPS of 97 cents, up 94%, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth.Facebook shares finished trading up 0.6% to 125.15.Tesla had its price target raised to 275 from 260 by FBN Securities. Tesla reported Q2 earnings on Wednesday that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Tesla delivered fewer cars in Q2 than originally planned. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.Shares dipped 0.3% to 230.03.3D Systems had its price target raised to 15 from 13 by Jefferies, which maintained a hold rating. The 3D printer maker on Wednesday posted adjusted EPS that doubled Wall Street expectations, sending its shares soaring 18% at the close. But illustrating the ongoing struggles in the 3D printer market, the company also reported its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue declines. Q2 revenue fell 7% to $158 million, missing estimates.Shares jumped 3.6% to 14.77.Costco had its price target raised to 170 from 160 at Cowen, which reaffirmed an outperform rating on the membership warehouse operator. The consensus price target on Costco is 172.Shares edged up 0.7% to 167.70.Coverage was initiated on Symantec by Barclays with an equal weight rating and price target of 24. Symantec reported Q2 earnings Thursday that beat estimates. Revenue fell 3% to $884 million, as adjusted EPS rose 12% to 29 cents.Shares jumped 4.1% Friday to 21.89.

290,SYMC,"Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps are on the road to Rio, but so are cybercrooks looking to bilk some of the bucks entering Brazil and hacktivists with an ax to grind.During the 2012 Olympics, the London Organizing Committee reported 166 million security-related ""events,"" including a half-dozen ""major"" attacks. And Japan is already prepping to spend $190 million to hire cybersecurity professionals ahead of the 2020 Games.So for the 2016 Games host Brazil, which Symantec (SYMC) cites as the source of 2% of all internet crime in 2015, cybersecurity is at the forefront, says Samir Kapuria, Symantec senior vice president of cybersecurity. Symantec says cybercrooks pull in $8 billion a year in Brazil. And the country is languishing in a deepening recession, already its worst in 25 years.Symantec, the No. 2 cybersecurity firm by market cap behind Check Point Software (CHKP), is among the companies tapped to help digitally secure the Rio Games. Planning started practically the day after the London Olympics ended, Kapuria told IBD.""We're thinking about all the vectors, what we learned from the (previous) event, what are the emerging threats,"" he said, looking ""to recognize the velocity in which the threat landscape is evolving.""Kapuria and Symantec have their work cut out for them. In 2012, London brought in about $988 million from tourists in town for the Games. That's an attractive target for organized crime, which accounts for 80% of digital thievery, says IBM's (IBM) vice president for security, Caleb Barlow.Hacktivists, too, could be looking for their 15 minutes of fame, Kapuria said. After all, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is at the center of a political scandal, Rio's crime rate is notoriously high, and the Zika virus had infected more than 1 million people.Says Stephen Boyer, chief technology officer of security vendor BitSight: ""You hear a lot about China being the Wild West of cybersecurity. You just don't hear as much about Brazil."" The Games could change that.If you think swimming star Michael Phelps' world-record butterfly is impressive, you ought to see the plethora of consumer- and fan-oriented scams circling the Olympics, experts say. Privately-held Kaspersky Lab found the first spam emails mentioning the 2016 Games early last year.""Major events attract spammer attention because they are a good opportunity to earn money from credulous people,"" Kaspersky researchers wrote in a May blog post. ""Spammers are attempting to convince victims that their email address has been chosen randomly from a large list.""To receive a prize -- often purported to be a free Olympic ticket -- users are prompted to send their personal information. Malicious websites backed by cheap SSL (secure sockets layer) certification attempt to do the same. SSL certification shows up as ""https"" in the address bar and so adds to the supposed legitimacy of the site.So, even before you've hit ""buy"" on your Rio de Janeiro airfare, you're being targeted by fraudsters.IBM's Barlow says events like the Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl and World Series draw a lot of cash. With a few search engine optimization tricks, cyber gangs can attract victims to malicious fake-ticketing sites, he says.""Bad guys are opportunistic,"" he told IBD. ""They're trying to fish you in. And they're always looking for that opportunity when someone's security guard is going to be down and be willing to click on something they might normally ask some questions about.""To that end, digital hucksters will send phishing emails containing malicious links, hijack media including photos and videos of Olympians and embed malware in phony apps to worm their way into your devices, Barlow says. And it's easy, he says.""Five to 10 years ago, you had to be a cyber-sleuth to figure out how to make an attack work,"" he said. ""Nowadays, you don't need any of that. You can rent these attacks. It's not difficult, and it doesn't take a lot of time to put an attack together. ... Cybercrime is being outsourced.""Brazilian thieves aren't the only ones stepping up their games for the 2016 Olympics. The globe's hackers will be armed to the teeth with digital weapons in preparation for the Olympics, says Symantec's Kapuria. Likewise, the white coats plan to bring their own A game.""Attackers don't wear a flag on their shirts,"" he said. ""The infrastructure is global. It might be applied locally, but it's really global capabilities that are being used. All the security and maturity that are established will be applied (in Brazil).""Kapuria, Symantec and Olympic officials have had years to plan for the 2016 Games. Scams, fake tickets, credit card theft and hacktivism are givens. But the biggest threats may be unseen, says RiskIQ lead developer Brandon Dixon. The Olympic Committee might make public Wi-Fi available, but that means some extra work will be needed to make it invulnerable to digital eavesdropping.""When you go into another country, you're looking to get connectivity, and one of the first things people do is try to find the internet,"" he told IBD. ""Having that public Wi-Fi available is something the Olympics will likely put an investment into.""Noted Barlow: ""You never know if someone is listening in on Wi-Fi."" And that's particularly true of public access points, says Private Giant CEO Shaun Murphy. It takes minimal skill to set up a Wi-Fi network and only a $50 device available on Amazon (AMZN) to listen in.EMV-backed credit cards -- also known as chip-and-pin cards -- are more secure. But the U.S. lags in adoption, which could hurt U.S. tourists looking to cheer on 16-year-old New Jersey high school track star Sydney McLaughlin in the 400-meter hurdles next month.""These are the same threats you have all the time, but it's more amplified and over a shorter period of time,"" Murphy told IBD. If a hacker's effort only pays off once, it was worth it, he says.To combat against the array of unknowns, Symantec has a three-prong strategy that includes information and threat protection from a variety of collaborators, woven into a broad security platform called the IQ layer. Kapuria likens the planning process to standing up a startup ... in a much smaller time frame.""How do you keep the good stuff in and protect it with encryption or data-loss prevention?"" he asked. ""How do you keep the bad guys out, how do you stop malware, how do you protect the endpoints involved, how do you protect the web interfaces, how do you protect the email?""And then there's the IQ layer -- weaving various entities' expertise to forge that protection. Symantec's piece of the puzzle lies in its global security operation centers (SOCs), which monitor emerging threats daily. So although planning began years ago, the threat information backing it is dynamic.Says Kapuria, ""Your plans start the day after, but your execution and implementation is done daily.""

291,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) completed its $4.65 billion acquisition of Blue Coat Systems on Monday, three days ahead of new CEO Greg Clark's first quarterly earnings report with the No. 2 cybersecurity firm. Symantec is slated to post its fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Thursday.On the stock market today, Symantec rose 0.6% to 20.55. Shares are up 20% this year following a $400 million cost-cutting plan announced in May that included 1,200 layoffs and closing a quarter of the company's offices.The Blue Coat acquisition sent Symantec shares rocketing. In the nine days following that June 12 announcement, Symantec stock rose 23% and hit a year high at 21.28. Since then shares have been consolidating.IBD'S TAKE: Symantec has a middling Composite Rating of 61, meaning it outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key metrics. CyberArk Software leads the industry group with a CR of 97.Clark headed up Blue Coat, a cloud security firm, until its acquisition by Symantec. Then he stepped in to replace Michael Brown, the former Symantec CEO.""At a time when the world faces more threats than it's ever encountered before, I couldn't be more confident in our ability to deliver what our customers need,"" Clark said in a statement Monday announcing the closing of the Blue Coat acquisition.Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman says Blue Coat dovetails with Symantec's two-year-old goal of becoming the leading pure player in the cybersecurity space. Symantec is No. 2 to Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) in terms of market cap among cybersecurity firms.Check Point's $13.1 billion market capitalization leads Symantec and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which carry $12.6 billion and $11.5 billion values, respectively. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group ranks No. 66 out of 197 groups tracked.For its fiscal Q1 ended on or near June 30, Symantec is expected to report $877 million in sales and 22 cents earnings per share ex items, according to the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Both metrics would be flat sequentially.Symantec spun off its data storage unit Veritas in January for $7.4 billion.
"
292,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) stock is leveling off after rocketing 23% in nine days last month on its $4.65 billion plan to acquire cloud security firm Blue Coat Systems. Still, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski has reiterated an overweight rating on shares.Nowinski also kept his 24 price target on Symantec stock, in a research note Tuesday. Shares have fallen 4% since hitting a 17-month high at 21.24 on June 23, but still are up 20% for the year, where IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group is down 17% and ranks just No. 163 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD.On Wednesday, Symantec ended trading up a fraction, to 20.38, on the stock market today.Symantec expects its Blue Coat acquisition to add $1.70 to $1.80 earnings per share in fiscal 2018, Nowinski wrote. The Wall Street consensus view is $1.39. Blue Coat will add a secure web gateway (SWG) and cloud access security broker (CASB) tools to Symantec's product portfolio.SWGs function like next-generation firewalls in that they provide URL/web traffic filtering, threat prevention and SSL encryption. SWGs also go deeper into app security/control, policy compliance, certificate verification and data loss prevention.Blue Coat's SWG, called ProxySG, accounts for more than half of its total sales and will likely replace Symantec's small SWG product, which has generated less than $5 million in annual sales, Nowinski wrote. He says CASB will be a big market in 2020.""Gartner has forecasted that 85% of large enterprises will use a CASB by 2020, up from just 5% today,"" Nowinski wrote. Symantec will likely integrate Blue Coat's CASB into its data loss prevention product, he says.Symantec will also use Blue Coat to create a threat intelligence ""data lake"" by gathering information via ProxySG and the duo's CASB products. As is, Symantec tracks 175 million endpoints and 2 billion emails daily.

293,SYMC,"Proofpoint (PFPT) late Thursday reported a 13-cent earnings beat and its first-ever quarter in the black, on double-digit Q2 sales growth, launching shares into the stratosphere Friday though analysts were somewhat mixed on the firm's future.Proofpoint stock jumped 10.5%, closing at 72.15 on the stock market today and hitting an eight-month high as it approached an all-time high of 75.46 touched last November.But shares are flat since December, and Proofpoint stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 41, meaning it underperforms nearly 60% of all stocks in terms of key metrics such as earnings power.IBD'S TAKE: Proofpoint is in IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group, which is led by CyberArk Software. CyberArk has a CR of 90, but it has slipped from 94 over the last week. The industry group ranks a low No. 160 out of 197 groups tracked. Check out Proofpoint's Stock Checkup here.For Q2, Proofpoint reported $89.9 million in sales, up 41% year over year, and 6 cents earnings per share ex items, swinging from a 9 cent per-share loss. Billings came in at $101.2 million, up 34%.Sales and EPS crushed the consensus model of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $84.2 million and a 7 cent per-share loss ex items.Q3 guidance for $93.5 million to $94.5 million in sales would be up 36% at the midpoint, topping analysts' estimate of $90.7 million. Proofpoint also guided to 4-6 cents EPS ex items, which would swing from a 6 cent loss. Billings of $114 million to $116 million would be up 35%.For 2017, Proofpoint guided to 28% sales growth and 31% billings growth.Emerging products (social, mobile and threat response/intelligence) grew by half in Q2 vs. last year, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research note. Its Targeted Attack Protection accounted for half of all new and add-on business in Q2, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski said.Proofpoint also saw higher win rates in Q2, Ho wrote. That jives with a recent Piper Jaffray survey of resellers that showed the company is frequently displacing Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC), Symantec (SYMC), Mimecast (MIME) and FireEye (FEYE).""Disruptive threats from business email compromise, malware, APTs and ransomware are likely to accelerate transition away from legacy solutions,"" Ho wrote. ""The migration of email infrastructures to (Microsoft (MSFT)) Office 365 will likely drive even further market share gains.""To that point, Proofpoint's imposter email security product is rivaled only by Mimecast, and a partnership with Intel's McAfee unit is starting to contribute to the pipeline, Ho says. Intel is ending its McAfee email security and transitioning clients to Proofpoint.Ho reiterated his outperform rating on Proofpoint stock. But Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens downgraded shares to sector weight, even while acknowledging Proofpoint's strong Q2 on market demand, weak competition and cloud adoption.Owens wrote, however, that Proofpoint stock is now too expensive. Owens has an 85 bull price target and a 39 bear price target on Proofpoint stock.""Should Proofpoint reset on a market pullback or worsening security sentiment, we would become more proactive on the name as we are still believers in the story/opportunity,"" he wrote.

296,SYMC,"Symantec's (SYMC) $4.65 billion acquisition of Blue Coat Systems isn't ""a silver bullet,"" but it was enough Monday to garner Symantec stock an upgrade to a buy rating from UBS analyst Brent Thill, who sees ""a new story here.""Thill sees an additional 20% upside to Symantec stock after the Blue Coat deal closes in Q3. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will replace Mike Brown as Symantec's CEO. Shares have rocketed 15% in the five trading days since Symantec announced its agreement to buy the cloud security firm.""While the deal is not a silver bullet for either party, we believe it will drive favorable near-term financial optics and that it reinvigorates Symantec's strategic relevance with enterprises, especially with a highly technical and respected CEO at the helm,"" Thill said in his research report.On the stock market today, Symantec stock ended the day up 2.5% to 20.47 while major indexes that lifted on a rosier outlook regarding Britain's vote Thursday on whether it will exit the European Union. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was up more than 0.8%.Thill previously rated Symantec stock a sell. On Monday, he also upped his price target to 24 from 16. That matched RBC analyst Matthew Hedberg, who on Monday kept an outperform rating but boosted his price target on Symantec stock to 24 from 23.Hedberg's price target boost boils down to the ""engaging, confident yet realistic and most of all believable"" Clark. Clark is deeply rooted in security tech, but he also knows how to scale a business on product and cost sides, Hedberg wrote in a research report.Symantec assumes $550 million in cost savings after acquiring Blue Coat, Hedberg wrote. Symantec could weave together its malware intelligence and Blue Coat's network- and cloud-security products, and integrate Blue Coat's ProxySG Web Gate information with Symantec's endpoint product.Symantec could also cross-sell Blue Coat's cloud access security broker and web-access firewall into Symantec's installed base for deeper penetration at small-business and midsize-business customers, he wrote.""The biggest risk is sales integration and execution,"" Hedberg wrote.But ""management doesn't see a problem with the current security demand environment and will likely take a deep look at the extensive product family to see where it makes sense to push growth or harvest cash flow,"" he said.

297,SYMC,"Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM) or Symantec (SYMC) could make a play for database-monitoring firm Imperva (IMPV), RBC analyst Matthew Hedberg said Monday, responding to reported rumors that Imperva is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.Imperva shot up during the regular session, but wiped out those gains and more after releasing preliminary Q2 earnings and revenue far short of its earlier guidance and Wall Street expectations.Elliott owned 10.9% of Imperva stock as of June 27, according to the company's most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Elliott is seeking to work with Imperva on ""strategic and operational opportunities,"" it said.But Imperva could seek a financial advisor as early as this week to help it review options, including a potential sale, and to help it deal with Elliott, Reuters reported Friday, citing anonymous sources.After the close, Imperva said it now expects to post a Q2 per-share loss minus items of 20 cents to 22 cents, on sales of $57.5 million to $58 million. It earlier had guided to a per-share loss ex items of 2 cents to 4 cents on sales of $65.5 million to $66.5 million.Imperva clsoed up 7.6% to 48.41 Monday after spiking as high as 51.70, a 5-month best. But shares tumbled nearly 12% in after-hours trading.""We are disappointed with our second-quarter financial results, which were primarily impacted by extended sales cycles across most geographies and verticals predominantly relating to larger deals,"" Imperva CEO Anthony Bettencourt said in the company's press release. ""During the quarter, we also experienced a reduction in size of several large purchases.""Hedberg, in his note released early Monday well before Imperva's release, kept his 55 price target and outperform rating on Imperva stock. He sees a bid of $55 to $78 per share, about $1.76 billion to $2.5 billion, as a fair bid on Imperva. That would be a 23%-75% premium to Friday's closing price at 44.76.""Overall this shouldn't come as a surprise to investors given activist pressure and uneven results in Q1,"" Hedberg wrote in a research report. During Q1, Imperva's Europe/Middle East/Africa sales stalled, prompting the firm to remove its EMEA head of sales.Imperva's bread-and-butter database activity monitoring offers opportunities and the potential for replacing IBM. That piece could be strategic for Cisco, IBM, Oracle (ORCL) or Symantec, Hedberg says. Symantec is planning to acquire Blue Coat Systems and reportedly tried to buy FireEye.Imperva's cloud assets might interest Microsoft (MSFT) Azure or Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Hedberg wrote.

298,SYMC,"Everything is for sale in tech markets -- with giants such as Apple (AAPL) among those actively looking -- though little is actually being sold, according to the latest report from M&A research firm Mergermarket, part of financial news and analysis provider Mergermarket Group.Mergermarket's overview of the first half of 2016 tracked the fewest number of tech, media and telecom (TMT) mergers and acquisitions, and the lowest deal value, since the first half of 2013.This is a ""rebalancing"" that follows a record 2015, the deal tracker said in its report, released Wednesday.China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) led the way in the first half of the year, with its $8.6 billion deal to acquire 84% of Finland's Supercell, the maker of such popular games as ""Clash of Clans."" Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) was the seller.Symantec's (SYMC) $4.6 billion agreement to acquire privately held Blue Coat Systems from Bain Capital was also among the few big deals for the period. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will become Symantec's CEO.But there were no ""megadeals"" of $10 billion-plus in the TMT sectors in the first half, compared with a record nine such deals in the year-earlier period, Mergermarket said. The firm counted 1,363 M&As in these fields in the first half of this year, down 16% from 1,580 in the year-earlier period. And the value of the deals fell 42%, to $223.1 billion.Telecom deal value plummeted 82% to $27.1 billion, Mergermarket said, the sector's lowest six-month tally since the first half of 2009. The numbers of deals fell to 78 from 100 in the first half of 2015.The IPO market, similarly, has been in the doldrums, with activity hitting a seven-year low in Q1, though Q2 did see some pickup.One reason for the decline noted by Mergermarket is that many tech companies are ""at the beginning of their innovation life cycle, and as a consequence, less mature businesses are coming to market commanding smaller price tags.""Indeed, Apple's deals so far this year were all small enough as to be immaterial, so the company didn't release terms for its acquisitions of such companies as Emotient, LearnSprout, Flyby Media and LegbaCore. Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, has said the company is actively looking for M&A opportunities.Apple, with a hoard of cash and equivalents worth more than $200 billion, can at times go big on M&As, such as its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, announced in 2014.The research firm also said European activity slowed in part because of the run-up to the Brexit vote.The report quoted Jennifer Nason, global chairman of TMT banking at JPMorgan, as saying Oracle (ORCL) is among companies that might be active in M&A for cloud software companies. ""A lot of tech companies are picking verticals to focus on,"" Nason said in the report.On Thursday, security software maker AVG Technologies (AVG) announced an agreement to be acquired by privately held Avast Software for $1.28 billion.

299,SYMC,"Microsoft (MSFT) will end support for its Windows XP operating system on April 8, which could lead to security problems for personal computers running the 12-year-old software. Despite that threat, the deadline is not expected to spark a last-minute rush of PC upgrades.
"
300,SYMC,"Businesses and other enterprises have been aware of the cutoff for quite some time. Still, about 30% of PCs in use run the venerable XP operating system.
"
301,SYMC,"Many consumers and businesses using XP simply will roll the dice and continue using those PCs until they break down, analysts say. But they might not replace them with Microsoft Windows PCs when they do, despite hopes late last year that corporate sales were stabilizing.
"
302,SYMC,"""I was in one warehouse location where they had fixed terminals that were on XP and they're now going to iPads,"" said Victor Janulaitis, CEO of tech consulting firm Janco Associates. ""So they're never going to do anything with those PCs. They're just sitting there. It's like an old-time punch-card time clock in a factory.""
"
303,SYMC,"Many Windows XP machines, especially at small and midsize businesses, are running particular legacy applications, Janulaitis said. For instance, they could be running a payroll application in accounting or an inventory application in the warehouse, he said.
"
304,SYMC,"No More Windows?
"
305,SYMC,"When those PCs break down, they'll get new machines, but they might not be Windows-based PCs, he said. In addition to Apple (AAPL) iPads and Google (GOOG) Android-based tablets, computer makers now are selling low-cost computers running Google Chrome OS and even Android.
"
306,SYMC,"Windows XP debuted in October 2001. And most PC users stuck with it after the release of Microsoft's problem-plagued Windows Vista in January 2007.
"
307,SYMC,"When Microsoft came out with its well-received Windows 7 in October 2009, businesses and consumers started to switch. But upgrades stalled when Microsoft released Windows 8 in October 2012. Customers rejected Windows 8 because of its radical redesign, which made use of touchscreens even though few PCs at the time had them.

308,SYMC,"Barely 'Move The Needle'
"
309,SYMC,"With the clock ticking down for Windows XP support, ""a good chunk of people who haven't upgraded yet probably will over the next couple of months,"" said Loren Loverde, an analyst with market research firm IDC. ""But that volume won't be enough to radically move the needle for the PC industry.""
"
310,SYMC,"About 70 million to 80 million Windows XP machines will be upgraded or replaced this year, Loverde said. That would be about half of new commercial PC shipments.
"
311,SYMC,"The main reason for upgrading is the security risk associated with running Windows XP after Microsoft no longer issues bug fixes and security patches for the OS, he says.
"
312,SYMC,"""There have been major security advancements since Windows XP that make later operating systems safer,"" said Brian Burch, vice president of global consumer and small business segment marketing for security software firm Symantec (SYMC). ""As vulnerabilities are discovered, patches can be purchased but will be very expensive.""

"
314,SYMC,"""We predict hackers, already in possession of zero day exploits, will wait until the 8th in order to sell them to the highest bidder,"" the network security firm said in its 2014 predictions. ""Because of their expected high price tag, these zero days will likely be used to launch targeted attacks against high-value businesses and individuals rather than deployed by common cybercriminals in order to propagate mass infections.""
"
315,SYMC,"Personal computer security issues could spur more businesses and individuals to consider cloud-based alternatives like Google Chrome OS machines.
"
316,SYMC,"Research firms Gartner and IDC reported last week that PC shipments tumbled 10% in 2013, the industry's worst annual decline ever in 2013. Both blamed the growth of tablet devices.
"
317,SYMC,"""Strong growth in tablets continued to negatively impact PC growth in emerging markets,"" Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. ""In emerging markets, the first connected device for consumers is most likely a smartphone, and their first computing device is a tablet. As a result, the adoption of PCs in emerging markets will be slower as consumers skip PCs for tablets.""
"
318,SYMC,"Global shipments of traditional PCs will decline 7% in 2014 and 3% in 2015, Gartner predicts.
"
319,SYMC,"Meanwhile, Microsoft is hoping its next version of Windows, code-named ""Threshold"" and likely to be called Windows 9, will erase the memory of Windows 8. Windows 9 is rumored to return the PC operating system to the traditional look and feel of the computer desktop, last seen in Windows 7. Microsoft is currently targeting an April 2015 release, according to media reports.
"
320,SYMC,"Microsoft will preview the new OS at its Build conference, which will take place in San Francisco on April 2-4, just days before it pulls the plug on XP.

Both blamed the growth of tablet devices.""Strong growth in tablets continued to negatively impact PC growth in emerging markets,"" Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. ""In emerging markets, the first connected device for consumers is most likely a smartphone, and their first computing device is a tablet. As a result, the adoption of PCs in emerging markets will be slower as consumers skip PCs for tablets.""Global shipments of traditional PCs will decline 7% in 2014 and 3% in 2015, Gartner predicts.Meanwhile, Microsoft is hoping its next version of Windows, code-named ""Threshold"" and likely to be called Windows 9, will erase the memory of Windows 8. Windows 9 is rumored to return the PC operating system to the traditional look and feel of the computer desktop, last seen in Windows 7. Microsoft is currently targeting an April 2015 release, according to media reports.Microsoft will preview the new OS at its Build conference, which will take place in San Francisco on April 2-4, just days before it pulls the plug on XP.The negative PC forecasts from Gartner and IDC came despite reports that some sectors of the market, especially corporate PC sales appear to be stabilizing.In late November, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) shares gapped up on its fiscal Q4 report and guidance that beat Wall Street's views. PC sales were better-than-expected and showed signs of stabilizing.Last month, Citi Research analyst Glen Yeung raised his rating on PC chipmaker Intel (INTC) to buy, based on research showing improved corporate PC demand.Also in December, Richard Pzena, CEO of Pzena Investment Management, said corporate PC sales appeared to be stabilizing, boosting HP's prospects.

329,SYMC,"AVG Technologies (AVG) stock rocketed to a 10-month-high early Thursday on news that privately held antivirus-maker Avast Software plans to acquire it in a $1.28 billion, all-cash bid to tap the global cybersecurity market.AVG also announced preliminary Q2 results. It sees June-quarter sales coming in at $104 million to $106 million vs. the consensus of six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $108.9 million. At the midpoint, revenue would be down 3% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Avast's offer comes to $25 per share, a 33% premium to AVG's Wednesday closing price of 18.79. AVG shot up 30.8% to 24.58 on the stock market today, touching an 11-month high after spending the last eight months below 22. AVG has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it underperforms more than half of its rivals in terms of earnings and growth.Czech Republic-based Avast aims to add AVG's mobile and PC security products to its portfolio of antivirus products.""Avast is pursing this acquisition to gain scale, technological depth and geographical breadth so the new organization can be in a position to take advantage of emerging growth opportunities in internet security, as well as organizational efficiencies,"" the company said in a statement.Together, Avast and AVG will have a network of more than 400 million endpoints, of which 160 million are mobile, ""that act as de facto sensors"" to provide information about malware threats. Avast says the deal will help it take advantage of nascent Internet of Things opportunities.Cybersecurity companies have keyed in on the IoT opportunity and the idea that billions of devices could be connected to the internet -- and are therefore at risk of compromise -- within the next decade.Both boards have approved the offer, Avast said. The transaction is expected to close between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15, depending on regulatory review.M&A within the cybersecurity sector has been relatively quiet in the first half of 2016. Symantec (SYMC) plans to spend $4.65 billion to acquire Blue Coat Systems, though was earlier said to be eyeing FireEye (FEYE). Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was reportedly considering a bid on Proofpoint (PFPT) earlier this year, an analyst told IBD.
"
330,SYMC,"Proofpoint (PFPT) is displacing Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC), Symantec (SYMC), FireEye (FEYE) and Mimecast (MIME), according to a Piper Jaffray survey of 28 resellers, released Tuesday ahead of the email-security firm's Q2 earnings slated for release late Thursday.The investment bank said the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union didn't greatly impact demand in Q2, but it found that 43% of resellers cited ""above average"" discounting in the quarter, up from 27% in Q1.But demand for Proofpoint is increasing. Nearly a third (29%) of resellers said Proofpoint's sales were above its plan, vs. 18% in the prior quarter.For Q2, Proofpoint is expected to report $84.2 million in sales, up 32% vs. Q2 2015, and a 7 cent per-share loss ex items, improving from a 9 cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Proofpoint models $94 million to $96 million in billings, up 26%.Proofpoint's quarterly sales have topped analysts' expectations for the past two years, and losses have either beat or met Wall Street's models for the past four quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Proofpoint has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 45, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of earnings power and key metrics. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group is led by CyberArk Software, which has a CR of 94.Almost three-quarters of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) resellers surveyed (71%) said demand was in line during Q2, improving from 41% in Q1. Similarly, 33% of resellers said Fortinet (FTNT) was above its plan vs. 8% in the prior quarter.Symantec, on the other hand, was more mixed -- 17% of resellers were above plan vs. 8% in Q1, but Symantec's net results were still negative, signaling a continued decline in demand. FireEye declined markedly to 56% below plan vs. 31% in Q1.IBD's Computer Software-Security group was down a fraction at the close on the stock market today, though Palo Alto Networks stock was up more than 1.2% to 125.46. Proofpoint stock was down 1.1% to 66.27, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) lost 1.4% to 53.37 and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) dropped 1% to 81.19.

331,SYMC,"Britain's withdrawal from the European Union could slug 39% of Mimecast's (MIME) fiscal Q2 sales on the recently devalued British pound, but it might also help U.K.-bound R&D expenses, Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick said Wednesday.Trebnick, however, retained her buy rating and 12 price target on Mimecast stock. Nearly 40% of Mimecast's sales are tied to the U.K., but ""beyond exchange-rate headwinds, management at this time does not expect any forward impact on new business generation,"" Trebnick said.Mimecast stock closed down 0.9% at 9.96 on the stock market today, just below its November IPO pricing. It competes in the email-security market against Proofpoint (PFPT), Symantec (SYMC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Barracuda Networks (CUDA).Mimecast's $9,000 order-average is likely small enough to avoid delays on macro uncertainty, Trebnick wrote in a research report. And Mimecast doesn't expect a significant change in its gross profit margins, which are somewhat forex-buffered, she said.Broadly, Mimecast competes with Proofpoint in North America and in deployments with more than 1,000 seats, but it doesn't see FireEye (FEYE) as competitive. Microsoft (MSFT) Office 365 could be a major tailwind, Trebnick says.Six months since its IPO, Mimecast hinted that acquisitions might not be imminent but that deal-making is something they ""wouldn't say no to,"" she wrote. She expects them to look at companies that provide email-specific solutions, as well as those that target malicious URLs and data leak prevention.

332,SYMC,"FireEye (FEYE) stock jumped late Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that it had snubbed a pair of lowball takeover bids, including one from Blue Coat Systems-acquirer Symantec (SYMC), according to unnamed sources.Wednesday, FireEye stock rose 4%, to 16.05, after earlier rising as much as 7.6% on the report of the two bids that FireEye reportedly rebuffed this year. Still, FireEye stock is down 21% for the year amid a CEO transition and struggling sales.Both offers were below the $30 per share that FireEye expected when it hired Morgan Stanley to seek bids, the sources said. In March, the second bidder suspended negotiations, the sources told Bloomberg.FireEye and Symantec reportedly ended their negotiations in February. This week, Symantec agreed to pay $4.65 billion to acquire cloud security firm Blue Coat.In an email, a FireEye spokesman said, ""Our fiduciary responsibility is to create shareholder value. We never lose sight of that. FireEye is an exciting company and we're always in discussions evaluating opportunities vs. our organic growth strategy. We feel very confident in our strategy.""Symantec, via email, said it doesn't comment on rumors or speculation.FireEye stock is 84% off its all-time high of 97.35, achieved in March 2014, and now trades much closer to its February record low of 11.35. A $30 per share bid would be an 87% premium to FireEye's closing price of 16.05 Wednesday.Last month, FireEye CEO David DeWalt announced his plan to step down and, starting Wednesday, he was replaced by Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.DeWalt made his announcement in conjunction with FireEye's third consecutive sales miss. FireEye reported better-than-expected Q1 losses, but the company has never been profitable.
"
333,SYMC,"Imperva (IMPV) stock rocketed to a seven-week high Tuesday after billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Associates revealed a nearly 10% stake in the cloud security firm, but Needham kept a hold rating on shares, questioning how much Imperva can pick up the pace later this year.At the close on the stock market today, Imperva stock finished up 12.4% to 45.46, leading IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group, which was up 1%. CyberArk Software (CYBR) climbed 3% to 49.77 and Symantec (SYMC) lifted 2.2% to 20.92.Elliott acquired 9.8% in Imperva stock late Monday, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, Elliott argues Imperva stock is ""materially undervalued.""Imperva ""operates in a highly strategic area of the technology industry with an attractive competitive position and a compelling product set in both the web-application firewall (WAF) and database activity monitoring markets,"" Elliott wrote.But Needham analyst Scott Zeller kept a hold rating Tuesday on Imperva stock. Zeller had downgraded shares in May after Imperva's June-quarter sales guidance for $65.5 million to $66.5 million missed views for $70.2 million, although sales would rise a solid 23% vs. last year at the midpoint of Imperva's forecast.For the year, Imperva guided to $304 million to $307 million in sales, up 30%. That would require a major second-half ramp. The consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models 10.5%, 23% and 20% quarter-over-quarter growth for the next three periods, respectively, to edge the midpoint of Imperva's guidance.""We continue to have reservations about the 'back-end loaded' year-end estimates,"" Zeller wrote in a research report. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales stalled in Q1, prompting Imperva to remove its EMEA head of sales, further risking Q2 and full-year sales.Elliott's guidance could be a boon, Zeller acknowledged. Elliott has been involved with Blue Coat, Riverbed, BMC Software, Qlik Technologies (QLIK), Novell and Compuware.And Imperva is in a sweet spot for cybersecurity spending, which has trudged below 2014-2015 levels.""The hysterical buying patterns in security software over the 2014-2015 time frame are showing signs of cooling, and growth rates are showing signs of deceleration,"" Zeller wrote. But he said that ""Imperva remains an attractive asset because of its scarcity value and position in security spending pockets which still get funding.""WAF (web application firewall) and database sales comprise about 40% and 45%, respectively, of Imperva's total revenue, leaving a 5% chunk for fast-growing cloud security. No. 2 cybersecurity firm Symantec last week announced an agreement to acquire cloud-security player Blue Coat for $4.65 billion. That deal is expected to close in Q3.Imperva's rivals are few and far between, Zeller notes. It competes minimally with F5 Networks (FFIV) in WAF and faces off with IBM (IBM) Guardium in database security.

334,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) is preparing to acquire Blue Coat Systems for about $4.65 billion in cash, a deal that will add to its cyberdefense technology and fill a high-turnover chief executive officer position.Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will take the helm of the combined corporation and join its board after the deal closes in the third quarter, both companies said in a statement. Clark will become Symantec’s fourth CEO in as many years, fulfilling its search for a leader with experience running a cybersecurity company and providing what investors hope will be much-needed stability. He replaces Michael Brown, who had overseen the January sale of Symantec’s Veritas data-storage division for $7.4 billion to the Carlyle Group (CG).The Mountain View, California-based company is in the midst of a major transition as it tries to recapture its momentum in the fast-growing cybersecurity market. The world’s largest developer of security software -- which reduced its sales and earnings forecasts in April -- is trying to re-invent itself for an industry that’s now vastly different from the antivirus software arena it helped pioneer.“With this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals,” Dan Schulman, chairman of Symantec, said in the statement.Clark will assume leadership of a company that’s fallen behind Palo Alto Networks (PANW), FireEye (FEYE), and other younger rivals in developing technologies to detect more advanced threats. Blue Coat brings a suite of products that can make Symantec more competitive in areas such as protecting customers’ data in the cloud, performing digital forensics in the hunt for hackers, and managing encrypted network traffic.Symantec had been in advanced talks to acquire FireEye earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. But discussions broke down over Symantec’s concerns about FireEye’s future growth potential, the person said, declining to be identified because the discussions were private. Like Symantec, FireEye is struggling with competition and had also recently cut revenue forecasts.Talks with Blue Coat then accelerated, the person said. As part of the deal, Bain Capital LLC, which controls the target company, will put $750 million of its proceeds from the sale into the combined company. Private equity firm Silver Lake will double its investment to $1 billion. The Blue Coat transaction should help Symantec realize another $150 million in annual net cost savings, on top of a previously announced $400 million yearly reduction in expenses, they said.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the acquisition Sunday.

Apple today begins its Worldwide Developers Conference, which could include new product features.Smith & Wesson jumped 6% as it climbs from support at the 200-day moving average. Sturm Ruger (RGR) was up more than 7%. Gun makers rose in the aftermath of the Orlando terrorist shooting Sunday, as gun stocks typically do following mass shootings and renewed calls for greater gun controls.Symantec shares rose nearly 5%. On Sunday, the company announced it would acquire cybersecurity rival Blue Coat for about $4.65 billion in cash. The deal was approved by both companies' boards and was expected to close in the third quarter, Symantec said in a press release. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will become chief executive of Symantec.The acquisition would give Symantec a cloud-based cybersecurity service that it says has the fastest growth in Web security market share. As part of the transaction, private equity group Silver Lake will invest an additional $500 million, and Bain Capital will invest $750 million more in Symantec convertible notes.Markets globally were jittery ahead of the Brexit vote and meetings of major central banks.In Europe, the FTSE 100 was down 0.7% in London, while the Paris CAC 40 was down 1.5% and the German DAX was 1.43 lower.Asian stocks sold off.

"
336,SYMC,"No. 3 cybersecurity firm Symantec (SYMC) could overtake rivals Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) in terms of market cap, thanks to its $4.65 billion plan to acquire privately held Blue Coat Systems, a cloud security firm.Symantec on Sunday announced its agreement to acquire Blue Coat, whose CEO, Greg Clark, will become Symantec's CEO. Last month, Symantec CEO Mike Brown announced he would step down, as the company reported fiscal Q4 sales that missed expectations and announced it would cut 1,200 jobs and close a quarter of its offices.Symantec CFO Thomas Seifert and Chairman Dan Schulman will remain in their positions. Blue Coat is owned by Bain Capital, and Bain managing director David Humphrey will join Symantec's board. Under the agreement, members of Blue Coat's management team will join Symantec and transition a portion of their cash and options into the combined entity.Symantec stock ended trading up 5.3% on the stock market today, to 18.21. Shares are up 17% over the past six months vs. a 16% decline in IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group. The group ranks just No. 183 out of 197 groups tracked.Blue Coat was previously considering an IPO, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote Monday in a research report. It's the market leader in secure web gateway products, he said, and is an emerging player in cloud access secure brokering, cloud data encryption and secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.""The combination of Symantec and Blue Coat shifts the landscape of cybersecurity, based on the consolidation of two of the largest stand-alone players in the space,"" Ho wrote. The acquisition gives Symantec better cross-sell and up-sell opportunities, he says.Symantec is third in market value, at $10.59 billion, behind Check Point's $14.98 billion and Palo Alto's $11.76 billion.Symantec will fund its Blue Coat bid with $2.8 billion in debt, a doubled investment by Silver Lake Partners to $1 billion, and a $750 million convertible debt investment by Bain. Thoma Bravo took Blue Coat private in 2012 for $1.3 billion before selling it to Bain in 2015 for $2.4 billion.Symantec management expects the deal to be ""nicely accretive"" and sees $1.70 to $1.80 earnings per share ex items for fiscal 2018 vs. expectations for $1.39. But Symantec reiterated fiscal Q1 guidance for $865 million to $895 million in sales and 24-26 cents EPS ex items, which would be down 4% at the midpoints.The acquisition is expected to drive $150 million in synergies. William Blair's Ho and Baird analyst Steven Ashley expect those synergies in general administration and sales.The deal could spur a wave of cybersecurity M&A, Ho says. He sees CyberArk Software (CYBR), Imperva (IMPV), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Rapid7 (RPD) as potential takeover targets. Legacy players like Symantec have struggled recently to launch competitive next-generation tools.Ho kept his market perform rating on Symantec stock. Ashley maintained his neutral rating.

337,SYMC,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is parsing the sale of its McAfee security unit less than three months after it announced a 12,000-job cut on weakening PC sales, according to anonymous sources cited Monday by the Financial Times.Intel bought McAfee antivirus software for $7.7 billion in 2010 with the goal of interlacing the security software into its chips. That plan hasn't come to fruition. Intel is now reportedly in talks with bankers for what could be a record security deal, the FT reported.Representatives of Intel declined comment to IBD.Last year, chip sector M&A hit a fever pitch, topping $100 billion. But 2016 hasn't been huge for semiconductor or cybersecurity deals.In chips, Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and its wireless infrastructure unit to MaxLinear (MXL).On the security side, Symantec (SYMC) is acquiring Blue Coat Systems, and IBM (IBM) bought incident response firm Resilient Systems. Symantec also reportedly put in a low-ball offer on FireEye (FEYE).The Blue Coat deal will help Symantec gain market cap, where it trails Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) but leads Palo Alto Networks (PANW).For Intel, the potential sale of its McAfee unit -- renamed Intel Security -- follows disappointing Q1 sales and a plan to cut 11% of its workforce globally, as the longtime No. 1 maker of computer chips redirects away from the slowing PC segment.PC sales comprised 55% of Intel's Q1 sales, but those sales have struggled in recent quarters as tablets and two-in-ones gain popularity. Now, Intel is pivoting to focus on high-growth areas like data centers, the Internet of Things and memory.Intel stock closed down 2.7% at 30.71 on the stock market today, after plunging 4.4% Friday as stocks markets worldwide reeled from the U.K.'s vote to exit the European Union. On Thursday, Intel stock topped its 32.85 buy point from a flat base, but shares are now in sell territory.

338,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) low 18% exposure to Europe, Middle East and Africa earned it a top spot alongside Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) on FBN's list of tech stocks to scoop up in the wake of the U.K.'s vote to exit the European Union.""Although we still like Google (GOOGL) very much, it does have a higher exposure to EMEA (30%) and the U.K. (10%),"" FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi wrote in a research report. ""Amazon (AMZN) remains a top pick of ours, but its exposure to EMEA (28%) and the U.K. (8%) are not insignificant.""The market toppled broadly Friday following the 52%-48% Brexit vote to leave the EU, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 3.4% and the Nasdaq composite off 4.1%. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was among groups hard hit, down 5.3%, despite the vote of confidence for Palo Alto.Palo Alto Networks stock, though, was down as much as some others in its group, down 3.85% on the stock market today. Rivals Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) were down a respective 3.8%. Harder hit Imperva (IMPV) and Fortinet (FTNT) stocks were down 5.4% and 7%, respectively.Seyrafi suggests that investors look at stocks with higher sales growth, free-cash-flow yields and strong EMEA moats. On those factors, Seyrafi suggests that investors dig their heels in on Facebook, Salesforce.com (CRM), Palo Alto, Cisco, Apple and FitBit (FIT) stocks.In terms of sales growth, Palo Alto Networks is likely to trail Facebook. Their estimates call for 28% and 33% growth in 2017, respectively. Palo Alto's sales have slowed recently from its typical 50%-plus rate. Seyrafi expects Cisco and Apple to see the slowest growth rates, at 3% and 2%, respectively.FitBit and Salesforce have the smallest EMEA exposure at 15% and 17%, to Palo Alto's 18%, among the companies that FBN reviewed. More than 20% of Apple, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter (TWTR), Tableau Software (DATA) and Splunk (SPLK) sales are tied to EMEA. Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Microsoft (MSFT) tip the boat with a 30%-plus exposure across the pond.However, Apple has the strongest free-cash-flow yield at 11%, leading Palo Alto at 10%, Cisco at 9.2% and FitBit at 7.6%. Salesforce and Facebook yield less than 4% apiece, says FBN.
"
339,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) fiscal Q4 and full-year sales will decelerate again in July, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho predicted Tuesday as he broadly cut estimates for the No. 3 cybersecurity firm.Palo Alto stock closed down 1% at 126.87 on the stock market today. Shares of top rivals Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) rose 0.3% and Symantec (SYMC) gained 2.2%.Palo Alto stock has been finding resistance at its 10-day line this month, and it's traded below its 50-day moving average every day but one over the past six weeks.For fiscal Q4 ending in July, Ho expects Palo Alto to report 37.1% year-over-year sales growth (about $389.2 million), braking from 48% growth in fiscal Q3. Last quarter was Palo Alto's first in eight that its sales had risen less than 50% year over year. For the year, Ho forecasts 34% growth, down from 55% last year and 51% the previous year.Ho's fiscal Q4 model is in line with the consensus of 42 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $389.4 million, up 37.2%, but other analysts are more bullish on Palo Alto's full-year sales. For the year, the consensus models 47.4% growth.Palo Alto's fiscal Q4 will shift toward services vs. products, Ho says. He cut his fiscal Q4 and full-year product sales growth projections to 21.5% and 20.6%, but upped his services views to 55.6% and 46.7% growth, respectively.Ho cut his fiscal Q4 billings model to $560.3 million from $581.6 million, and now sees full-year billings growth of 37.2% vs. earlier expectations for 42.7% growth.Still, he reiterated his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.
"
340,SYMC,"Symantec's (SYMC) enterprise unit will take the brunt of the company's $400 million cost-cutting plan, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski said Wednesday as he reiterated an overweight rating and 24 price target on Symantec stock.The No. 3 cybersecurity firm announced the cost cuts in May after reporting fiscal Q4 sales that missed expectations. A month earlier, Symantec CEO Michael Brown said he would step down as soon as a new CEO is hired.Nowinski expects Symantec's board to fill the CEO slot over the next six months and sees a ""clear roadmap"" for its two-year cost-cutting strategy.""We believe the company is looking for a CEO that possesses both a software and operational background, needed to drive the $400 million in operating expense cut,"" Nowinski wrote in a research report.Most of the cuts are expected to hit the enterprise unit, which last quarter accounted for 53% of the company's total $929 million in revenue. The company's 25% operating margin ex items, meanwhile, was largely driven by the consumer segment.The company's five-step cost-cutting plan includes 1,200 layoffs and closing a quarter of its offices.Symantec also anticipates savings through the streamlining of its enterprise portfolio and cutting of some services it shared with Veritas. Symantec completed the sale of data-storage unit Veritas in January.Nowinski says Symantec's advanced threat protection products can gain traction. In March, Symantec said it sold 1.2 million ATP endpoint subscriptions, just 1% of the 110 million total endpoints in its installed enterprise base.This suggests ""the remaining market opportunity is significant,"" Nowinski wrote. ""Management also said they have a sales pipeline for ATP products well over $100 million, which represents roughly 5.2% of the expected enterprise revenue for fiscal 2017.""But sales are expected to fall this fiscal year. Symantec models a 3%-6% dip in consumer sales, and flat to a 2% decline in enterprise sales.Symantec stock ended down 0.3% on the stock market today. Shares fell 6.9% on April 28 after Brown announced his departure and the company trimmed its fiscal Q4 guidance. Since then, shares have edged up and are higher by 3% for 2016.Shares of top rivals Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) are up 4% and down 25%, respectively, for the year. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group is down 16% since Dec. 31 and ranks just No. 184 out of 197 groups tracked.

Net neutrality rules were upheld in a big win for the FCC, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX). American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers fell sharply. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) unveiled software and services updates at its developers conference, while hardware dominated the E3 video game expo.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1.9%, hurt by big techs such as Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. The S&P 500 lost 1.2% and the Dow 1.1%. The Federal Reserve took a more dovish stance on rate hikes, but was still more hawkish than markets. Meanwhile, Brexit fears sent bond yields tumbling worldwide.

The Nasdaq fell below its 200-day average.  Energy stocks fell with oil prices, while American Air and global peers tumbled on Brexit and terror fears.The Federal Reserve left interest rates alone, as expected, in the wake of the weak May jobs report and concerns over the looming Brexit vote. Policymakers turned more dovish. Six officials now see just one rate hike this year vs. just one official previous. Still, 11 are betting on two hikes. Yet markets, which have priced out expectations for a hike until next year, sold off following the Fed meeting. The Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat also hit markets, even though no BoJ action was expected.Meanwhile, industrial output fell 0.4% in May, but two regional manufacturing reports were positive in June. Retail sales were stronger than expected in May, while housing starts were in line. Consumer inflation remained tame.Microsoft said Monday that it will acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion cash, or $196-per-share, surprising many investors and analysts. The transaction is seen closing this year. The buy brings LinkedIn's user data and sales tools to the tech giant. Canaccord Genuity said the move might prompt more cloud-computing M&A. Microsoft stock fell 2.6% for the week. LinkedIn shot up 45.6% to 190.80.Net neutrality rules were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, delivering a big win to the Federal Communications Commission, as well as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix. AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Comcast (CMCSA) had hoped the three-judge panel would at least strike down net neutrality rules applied to wireless networks. AT&T and others plan an appeal to the Supreme Court. But the one judge who dissented did agree in part that the agency had the authority to reclassify broadband internet as a telecom service under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.Apple unveiled software improvements for the iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac computers during a keynote event at its Worldwide Developers Conference.

Meanwhile, Sony (SNE) set an Oct. 13 release date for PlayStation VR.Analysts say Electronic Arts (EA) games ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" captured the most positive buzz, though EA was not on E3's show floor but at its own event across the street. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) shares fell amid the absence of new game title announcements. Analysts said the lack of major game titles for new virtual-reality headsets was a letdown, but publishers don't want to devote their resources until the VR market becomes more established.Meanwhile, Chinese messaging giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) reportedly is close to a $9 billion takeover deal for ""Clash of Clans"" creator Supercell. Tencent owns Riot Games, which runs the popular ""League of Legends"" game.Oracle (ORCL) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share minus items of 81 cents, up 4% from a year earlier, meeting views and ending a four-quarter string of year-over-year EPS declines.Revenue fell 1% to $10.6 billion, the fifth straight quarterly decline but slightly above the consensus of $10.47 billion.  The business software powerhouse is shifting from on-premise software licensed for the long term to software-as-a-service delivered via the cloud. Oracle cloud revenue in Q4 reached $859 million, up 49%.Oracle stock rose 2.4% for the week, with all of the gains coming Friday after its late Thursday earnings report.China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA)  sees revenue rising 48% in the year ending in March 2017, well above the consensus estimate of 38.6%. It was Alibaba's first financial preview since coming public in 2014, and comes as the company faces an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into accounting practices.Meanwhile, China search engine leader Baidu (BIDU) late Monday cut its Q2 revenue forecast about 10%, citing advertising cuts and delays by health care firms. Baidu faced public outrage and regulatory probes after the death of a college student who accused Baidu of leading him to a false cancer treatment. Baidu has tried to address the problem with changes to its paid search program, which promote paid content above other listing results.Baidu stock is off 1% for the week.

Stockpiles fell by 993,000, less than expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels, but below the American Petroleum Institute's estimate that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels. The International Energy Agency said it saw its first ""significant drop"" in supply since 2013 in May and that oil markets will likely balance in the second half of the year. OPEC also sees oil markets in balance by year-end. Meanwhile, U.S. rigs in operation rose for a third straight week to an eight-week high, a sign of stabilization after oil prices rebounded strongly from January lows.But prices fell sharply as Brexit fears raised growth worries and propped up the dollar. Oil prices fell 2.2% to $47.98 a barrel, but closed well off weekly lows.The ISIS-inspired mass shooting of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that killed 49 plus the shooter sent shares of gunmakers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) sharply higher Monday as Wall Street anticipated higher gun sales spurred by regulatory concerns. Smith & Wesson reported strong earnings and guidance late Thursday. Smith & Wesson stock rose 10.5% this week. Sturm Ruger climbed 5.6%.Meanwhile, airline stocks tumbled, partly on fears that the Orlando attack could deter travel as well as concerns that the U.K. could vote June 23 to exit the European Union. American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell to their lowest levels since late 2014 during the week.Card issuers Capital One (COF) (IBD) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) downplayed any potential concerns related to rising consumer debt. But Synchrony said Tuesday that it expected to write off slightly more consumer debt as a loss over the next year. A day later, Capital One said it would not change its loss forecast even as its net charge-off rate and delinquencies rose in May. Warnings have increased about rising credit-card and auto-loan debt. Synchrony crashed 16.3% this week, and Capital One 8.35%. American Express (AXP) lost 4.8% and Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 6.2%.
"
342,SYMC,"FireEye (FEYE) researchers say a series of cyberattacks on Middle Eastern banks isn't related to an earlier digital heist of Bangladesh Bank that netted $81 million, but didn't say whether it has ties to similar assults on banks in Ecuador and Vietnam.This month, FireEye's DTI (dynamic threat intelligence) discovered ""a wave of emails containing malicious attachments being sent to multiple banks in the Middle East region,"" according to a company blog post Sunday.""The threat actors appear to be performing initial reconnaissance against would-be targets,"" researchers wrote, ""and the attacks caught our attention since they were using unique scripts not commonly seen in crimeware campaigns.""A FireEye spokesman told IBD the Middle Eastern assault doesn’t appear to be related to a recent attack on Bangladesh Bank, but didn’t say whether it could be tied to breaches of banks in Ecuador and Vietnam.The Bangladesh breach is one of the biggest in history. FireEye reportedly was hired to investigate.In the Middle East case, hackers sent malware-infused emails with themes related to IT infrastructure ""such as a log of sever status report or a list of Cisco Iron Port Appliance details,"" FireEye researchers wrote.Employees forwarded the email on, containing an infected, macros-enabled Microsoft Excel file. Microsoft Office documents are frequently used in crimeware campaigns because default settings require users to order macros to run.""Attackers may convince victims to enable risky macro code by telling them that the macro is required to view 'protected content,'"" researchers wrote. But this campaign took it a step further, hiding the malware in plain sight.""This was done for the purpose of social engineering -- specifically, to convince the victim that enabling the macro did, in fact, result in the 'unhiding' of additional spreadsheet data,"" researchers wrote.Hackers installed a batch file to collect important system data including user and group accounts, network configuration data and running processes. Unusually, the malware used DNS (domain name system) queries to extract the data.""This was likely done because DNS is required for normal network operations,"" researchers said. ""The DNS protocol is unlikely to be blocked and its use is unlikely to raise suspicion among network defenders.""Users can protect themselves by disabling Microsoft Office macros ""and also by being more vigilant when enabling macros,"" FireEye said.In trading on the stock market today, FireEye stock lifted more than 3.3% to 14.25, outplaying the IBD Computer Software-Security industry group, which collectively was up a fraction. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) stock was up 1.6% to 143.97. Symantec (SYMC) was flat at 16.92.
"
343,SYMC,"Fears of a broad cybersecurity freeze could amplify after vendors Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye (FEYE) missed April-quarter expectations and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Imperva (IMPV) guided toward slower growth.Then again, rather than a broad slowdown, the pure-play security leaders might in fact be losing some business to tech giants Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), which are expanding deeper into security, and to specialized security vendors such as CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast (MIME).""Investors tend to look at security as a single sector, and the reality is you have a lot of different plays here,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens told IBD. ""In aggregate, we're seeing relatively consistent spending. There is some shifting that is happening, but that makes sense.""Security spending overall rose 13% year over year in Q1, barely down from 14% growth in Q4, Owens says. He says those growth rates are consistent with the past two years.Palo Alto, Fortinet and Check Point all had been hot stocks in 2014 and much of 2015 on the strength of their broad security platforms, but not this year. The focus has shifted to specific security areas such as privileged account management, email and cloud security, and endpoint protection, analysts say. So, while some vendors might be slowing, others are rising, Owens says.Fears of a broad security slowdown go back to last year, Owens told IBD.""We've been having this end-of-the-world discussion for a year now,"" he said. ""Certain vendors that may have been growing at rapid rates (have) decelerated.""Palo Alto Networks -- the No. 2 security software company by market cap, behind Check Point -- is an industry bellwether.Last month, Palo Alto disappointed Wall Street. It guided to 37% year-over-year sales growth for the current quarter, which would be great for most companies but would represents the highflier's slowest-ever growth. Last quarter was the first in eight where its sales rose less than 50%.But the slowdown is relative, Pacific Crest's Owens says.""Palo Alto will continue to perform well, but it can't continue to grow at four times the industry,"" he said. ""Fifty percent to 60% growth is unsustainable.""Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski anticipated slow April demand for Palo Alto products, citing checks with resellers.But Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick characterized the April slowdown as a ""blip"" in a typically seasonally weak quarter. She blamed FireEye CEO David DeWalt for the panic. During FireEye's fiscal Q3 earnings call in November 2015, DeWalt said ""emergency spending"" in the wake of the notable Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) breaches had normalized.""The CEO of FireEye last year said, 'You're just not having all these big breaches and we're not getting attacked from China as much, so spending is slow,'"" she said. ""So, everyone has been chanting the mantra.""(DeWalt is set to step down June 15, leaving COO and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia to take the reins. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.)Palo Alto Networks wasn't the only pure player to spot braking growth. On May 5, FireEye guided to its slowest quarter ever, and Imperva's outlook for this quarter would mark a fourth straight quarter of sales deceleration. In April, Check Point guided to 6% growth for Q2, down from six straight periods of 9% growth.Fortinet expects sales growth to slow to 27% in Q2 from 34% growth in the prior quarter. And even email specialist Proofpoint -- among those analysts peg as on the rise -- guided to its slowest quarterly growth in 11 quarters, to 32% growth from 37% the prior quarter.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group reflects fears of a general tech slowdown. The group was down as much as 34% for the year in early February, hitting a two-year low, as many tech stocks tanked on dour views from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). The group has since recovered in part, but is still down nearly 16% for the year.Cybersecurity Ventures Managing Editor Steve Morgan says pure players like Palo Alto, Check Point and Fortinet are no longer good barometers for the health of the industry. Instead, thousands of venture-capital-backed startups -- as well as tech giants increasingly expanding their security presence -- are gouging share.In Q1, IBM pulled in $400 million in security sales -- topping Palo Alto, Fortinet and FireEye, and closing in on Symantec (SYMC) -- up 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 12% growth in all of 2015. Its overall sales fell 5%. For its fiscal Q3 ended April 30, Cisco said its security sales jumped 17% year over year, accelerating from 11% growth in fiscal Q2.Still, the accelerating growth for the IBM and Cisco security businesses falls short of the decelerating growth for most of the pure players. The big companies, though, aren't going away.Microsoft (MSFT) swept three cybersecurity players off the public map in 2015 via acquisitions, but the company doesn't break out its cybersecurity revenue, Morgan points out. And Dell subsidiary SonicWall, acquired in 2012, is potentially pulling in billions, but since Dell is now privately held those figures aren't reported publicly.""That revenue just goes away from what's reported in the public market,"" Morgan told IBD. ""Unless you cover the market really carefully, you won't hear about it.""But the cybersecurity VC market is still booming, he says. In 2015, Dow Jones estimated that $1.9 billion in VC funding was spent backing cybersecurity startups, Morgan says. At one time, it was unheard of for cybersecurity startups to raise more than high single digits in funding, and ""now we're routinely seeing (funding hit) $50 million, $75 million, $100 million.""Those VC-backed companies are ""competing aggressively in the market,"" Morgan said. ""But if they're not public, their revenue figures aren't necessarily being reported.""As private businesses like MalwareBytes, the Herjavec Group (tied to Robert Herjavec of the ""Shark Tank"" TV show) and Black Duck Software begin to achieve scale, they'll further steal share from the publicly traded security firms, Morgan says.Pacific Crest's Owens sees pent-up demand. He says companies still aren't spending enough on security. He ballparks annual IT spending overall near $1 trillion, and cybersecurity spending at $25 billion to $30 billion.""I think security has been an under-spend area for decades,"" he said. ""You're spending about 3% of your capex (capital expenditures) that's focused on IT on security. That's relatively low. Some regulated industries like health care might be two or three times that, but there's still a long way to go.""Building up security spending takes time, Owens says.""There's that perception that you're able to spend an unlimited amount of dollars overnight within security, but that's just not the case in reality,"" he said. ""It's not an overnight type of thing.""Network security still has headroom, Owens says, and he sees products focused on authentication, detection, remediation and endpoint solutions as leaders. Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury pegs privileged account management -- CyberArk's bread and butter -- as the industry's next growth vector. Dougherty's Trebnick expects email security providers like Proofpoint and Mimecast to pick up share. Morgan's bet is on cloud security.Meanwhile, Symantec, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and FireEye will continue to struggle, Owens says. Symantec may ""throw out billions in cash flow"" to survive attempts to transition from legacy antivirus to next-generation endpoint protection. FireEye is shifting to a subscription model. Juniper and Barracuda deal with broader macro issues outside cybersecurity, he says.So, back to the original question: Is security spending slowing?Not for many, Morgan says.""What I think you're seeing is a squeeze on the pure-play company,"" he said. But overall, instead of any slowdown, ""I think we're entering an uptick. Spending is up, undoubtedly.""

344,SYMC,"Days after Twitter (TWTR) accounts belonging to Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the NFL were hacked, cybersecurity firm Proofpoint (PFPT) says its total addressable market has never been bigger -- $10 billion by 2019.That will have doubled since 2013, according to industry tracker IDC. Then, emerging markets, which includes social media, represented less than 1% of the TAM. By 2019, that business could be a $2.9 billion opportunity, or 15% of the TAM, says IDC.And social media security is only in nascent stages, Proofpoint CEO Gary Steele told analysts Wednesday at the company's analyst day in San Francisco. Proofpoint, with 2015 revenue of $265 million, already is swiping share from rivals such as Symantec (SYMC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and FireEye (FEYE), Steele claims.Proofpoint's $2.7 billion market cap pales vs. Cisco's $147 billion and security leader Check Point Software Technology's (CHKP) $15.2 billion value, but Proofpoint outperforms its rivals time and time again, Steele says.""We manage the threat data for a high efficacy rate,"" he said. ""That's how we sell. That's how Tracey's (head of global sales Tracey Newell) team wins every deal. Simply put, we scare the (expletive) out of people. We show people what we catch.""Since its IPO in 2012, Proofpoint has achieved a 35% compound annual growth rate and, despite Wall Street whispers of a cybersecurity slowdown in 2016, Steele says Proofpoint hasn't seen any ""choppiness"" in the market.""We've seen no reduction in budgets as it relates to our projects,"" he said. ""We're clearly over the line in ... being high-priority in terms of (spending). We've seen no change in macro.""Proofpoint stock rose 1.4% in the stock market today, to 64.40, touching a five-month high. Shares are up more than 80% since hitting a 20-month low in early February.Malware campaigns jumped 800% vs. the year-earlier quarter and 66% sequentially in Q1, Steele said. David Knight, head of information security products, blamed user naivete. Since January 2015, human-error attacks have accounted for $2.3 billion in losses, says the FBI.That's because the user is most vulnerable, Knight told analysts. Whereas the infrastructure is susceptible to brute force, phishing attacks -- by email, social media and mobile -- appear legitimate and prey on users' good intentions.Such was the case in February and March when a phishing scheme duped Snapchat and Seagate Technology (STX) into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms. It's a matter of simply ""tricking"" users into handing over their credentials, Knight said.Devin Redmond, Proofpoint's vice president of social media security and compliance, expects phishing attacks to burgeon this year and next. He says the ""angler phish"" is most complex -- requiring fake accounts and websites to prey on real customers.For example, @John_Smith tweets to @bank that he's having trouble logging into his account. A spoof account -- appearing wholly legitimate -- offers to help @John_Smith with his login issue and provides a link to its credential-confirming website.It looks real, Redmond said.""The website asks for his pin code, security questions, ATM card number, pin number, social security number and data of birth,"" he said. ""It's not just getting his credential, it's getting all of the customer's information and then cleaning out his bank account.""Phishing attacks can be used to spread malicious links, Redmond said.Proofpoint is hoping to throw a wrench into hackers' processes by teaming up with CyberArk Software (CYBR), Imperva (IMPV), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Splunk (SPLK) -- a series of partnerships announced this week.Earlier, Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Mobileiron (MOBL) and VMWare (VMW) integrated with Proofpoint's Nexus One platform.""We heard it loud and clear from customers, that what they needed is the products they buy from multiple vendors to work together,"" Steele told IBD. ""It's strategically important for us to create that for the customer for their environment.""But the overall industry has made embarrassingly little collaborative progress, Steele says. Proofpoint has integrated with eight or nine social media applications and 150 app stores, ""not just Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) Play,"" Knight told analysts. And it's free, Steele says.He credits Proofpoint's platform, Nexus, for the ability to integrate with other systems. Nexus controls Proofpoint's email, social and mobile visibility. Companies like Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk now can use that data in their own cyberbattles.It's a huge cybersecurity step forward, Steele says.""We saw lots of vendors delivering discrete point solutions, many of which didn't operate well with each other,"" he said. ""We believe vendor platforms need to integrate natively and you need to be able to make those relationships work well together.""

345,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) CEO Michael Brown will step down, the No. 3 cybersecurity firm announced Thursday after trimming fiscal Q4 guidance on dwindling licensing sales. Symantec stock crashed to its lowest point in more than a month.Shares closed down 6.7% at 16.89, recovering minimally from an 8% plunge earlier in the day. Shares hit a year-high 18.85 on March 21, but have since declined 11.6%.For its fiscal Q4 ended April 1, Symantec trimmed its sales view to $873 million, representing a 6% drop, from earlier expectations for $885 million to $915 million, and now sees 22 cents earnings per share, down 24%, vs. prior guidance for 24-27 cents.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had called for $893.1 million and 24 cents.Symantec will officially announce its fiscal Q4 results after the close May 12.Brown will serve until a new CEO is hired. Through the transition, the board tapped Silver Lake Partners exec Ajei Gopal, Symantec Chief Financial Officer Thomas Seifert and Symantec Executive Vice President Scott Taylor to collectively carry out the role of ""office of the president.""The office will remain in place until a new CEO joins the company, Symantec said in a release. Together, the trio will focus on cost-cutting measures to reduce costs by $400 million over the next two years.Symantec's May 26 financial day has been postponed.

346,SYMC,"Adobe Systems (ADBE), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec (SYMC) are among smaller sharks that could get involved in the ongoing acquisition spree of software companies, says Pacific Crest Securities.Salesforce.com (CRM) last week acquired Demandware (DWRE), sparking speculation over what other companies could be acquired. Playing matchmaker, Pacific Crest says in a research report that Adobe could target Shopify (SHOP). One analyst last week said Adobe could have been in the hunt for Demandware.Adobe Systems stock closed up 0.4% in the stock market today. Shopify rose 1.4%. Symantec ended essentially flat, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock climbed 3.3%.Other possible targets, speculates Pacific Crest, include such ""minnows"" as  Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Apigee (APIC) and Imperva (IMPV).While Microsoft (MSFT) was not active in the 2011 round of software-related M&As, Pacific Crest says it looms as a buyer in the current cycle. Microsoft in early 2015 tried to buy Salesforce.com, said reports. Some rumors of late, though, have Amazon.com as a possible Salesforce.com buyer.Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a move that could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say. HPE holds its Discover 2016 conference this week in Las Vegas, where new partnerships may be announced.Pacific Crest speculates that IBM could be a suitor for a security software firm or Apigee.“The 2016 M&A cycle includes a larger pool of minnows, but also more sharks,” said the Pacific Crest report. “Not only do we see the size of the software M&A pool expanding into analytics and security this cycle, we also believe the vertical software market is ripe for consolidation, particularly within health care.”Pacific Crest also includes Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in its pool of potential sharks. It says SAP, Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), too, could be on the prowl, as is usually the case for those sharks.

347,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) is cutting 1,200 jobs and closing a quarter of its offices as part of a broad $400 million cost reduction plan, the No. 3 cybersecurity firm announced Thursday as it reported fiscal Q4 sales that missed Wall Street views.On Friday, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said he was ""perplexed"" by the cuts at a time when older, legacy players like Symantec need to work to catch up with next-generation vendors such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW).""We are perplexed at how the company plans to reposition itself as a next-generation security player and reaccelerate growth, while simultaneously reducing spending and headcount,"" Ho wrote in a research report. But he called the strategy ""ambitious"" and maintained his market perform rating on Symantec stock.On the stock market today, Symantec stock fell a fraction, to 16.79. Shares began forming a handle on March 21, but they have since fallen 10%, matching an equal decline in IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group.For its fiscal Q4 ended April 1, Symantec reported $873 million in sales and 22 cents earnings per share minus items, down a respective 6% and 24% year over year, but in line with the company's preannouncement.Both metrics lagged the consensus of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $878.7 million in revenue and 23 cents EPS.Symantec's $3.6 billion in fiscal 2016 sales met the consensus model, but $1.03 EPS ex items missed by a penny. On a year-over-year basis, the measures fell 10% and 21%, respectively.Adjusting for currency, consumer sales fell a respective 7% and 9% during fiscal Q4 and fiscal 2016, leading 4% and 2% declines in enterprise sales. Symantec blamed the enterprise decline on a shift in customer spending toward subscriptions and away from licenses.Ho said the accelerating migration to next-generation subscription products disfavors a legacy player like Symantec.""We remain concerned that the long-term transition away from legacy antivirus to next-generation solutions may be happening at an accelerating pace, which could be a headwind to Symantec's legacy business,"" he wrote.Current-quarter guidance for $865 million to $895 million in sales and 24-26 cents EPS minus items would be down 4% at the midpoints. For fiscal 2017, Symantec guided to $3.49 billion to $3.58 billion, which would be down 2% at the midpoint but better than the 10% decline in fiscal 2016.Symantec's job cuts represent about 9% of its workforce and will save about $100 million, CFO Thomas Seifert told analysts on the company's earnings conference call late Thursday. As of Thursday, Symantec's 11,223 headcount was already down 43% from a year ago.The company hopes that closing 25% of its facilities will save another $35 million. The company also plans to trim target service agent and IT costs ""stranded"" after the Veritas divestiture, and it is reining in $100 million in spending. Symantec early this year completed the sale of data storage software maker Veritas to a group led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group (CG) for about $5.3 billion after taxes.

348,SYMC,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) stock lifted Thursday on a bullish report from Imperial Capital that sees an 8% upside to the privileged account manager's Q1 earnings, posted early this month, driven by increased cross-selling opportunities and broader greenfield adoption.Imperial Capital analyst Michael Kim kept his in-line rating on CyberArk stock, but boosted his price target to 45 from 41. In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, CyberArk stock rose 2.6%, to 42.54, and touched a six-week high. But shares are 16% off a 2016 high of 49.56, achieved Jan. 22.The lift defied a slight fractional decline in IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group. Shares of Imperva (IMPV), FireEye (FEYE) and Symantec (SYMC) all fell a fraction Thursday, while Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) stock fell 1%.""At current levels, we think CyberArk shares offer balanced risk/reward,"" Kim wrote in a research report. ""Investors could become more constructive as the company gains greater scale and broader adoption of its new offerings.""Kim expects less volatile near-term license revenue growth and margin expansion. But he cut his 2017 earnings per share minus items view to $1.14 from $1.16 on expected investments in growth. Wall Street models $1.13, up 23% above 2016 views for 92 cents.CyberArk still has runway to add new customers, Kim wrote. During Q1, CyberArk added 100 new customers, bringing the company's installed base to 2,600. Nearly a third of new customers added three or more products, ""highlighting the company's broadening cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.""In Q1, CyberArk also doubled its sales in its government, health care, retail, media and education segments. License revenue grew 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter, trailing 50% growth in the maintenance and professional services business.

349,SYMC,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) launched an alliance Wednesday, tapping FireEye (FEYE), Intel (INTC) and Symantec (SYMC) for what it called tighter best-of-breed integration, which offers an alternative to security platforms from such companies as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) and Fortinet (FTNT).In total, the C3 Alliance has 15 members across cybersecurity, enterprise software and infrastructure. They include Qualys (QLYS), Rapid7 (RPD), Varonis Systems (VRNS) and Belden (BDC)-owned Tripwire. CyberArk tech will be integrated into the partners' software.Megabreaches like that of retailer Target (TGT) in 2014 have highlighted the need to secure credentialed accounts, says Adam Bosnian, CyberArk's executive vice president of global business development. Privileged account protection is at CyberArk's core.""We saw more and more organizations becoming aware of being exposed by these power accounts,"" Bosnian told IBD. The C3 Alliance aims to ""solve these challenges and leverage the valuable data that comes off that security.""CyberArk's technology will be integrated in a variety of ways, Bosnian said. C3 member Tenable Network Security, a continuous monitoring and vulnerability management company, requires credentialed access to perform deep-dive hunting for vulnerabilities, Tenable strategist Cris Thomas told IBD.A hacker needs only one credential to wreak havoc.""When a hacker attacks an organization, they compromise one specific point,"" Thomas said. ""To move, they need a Zero Day (vulnerability). ... The easiest way to do it is to steal credentials. Those are the prized goals of an attacker.""Integrating technology from CyberArk and Tenable lets Tenable's 20,000 customers store credentialed passwords using CyberArk software, he said. It also gums up any holes existing between the vendors' software, making intrusion that much more difficult.Bosnian doesn't foresee ""one-off, snowflake"" integrations. He sees CyberArk tech, in conjunction with partners' software, providing a platform-like infrastructure, constantly evolving as new integrations are added to the mix.Customers are still leery of the platform, which might be ""best-of-breed in one piece of the platform but not in another,"" Bosnian said. The C3 Alliance, however, is comprised of best-of-breed tech woven into one unified solution that shares data bidirectionally, he says.C3 is not a monolithic alliance, he said.""These partners are improving how they use privileged accounts in their environment,"" he said. ""The real magic is when there are use cases built on top of that to solve real problems. That's what we're trying to do.""CyberArk stock was up 2% in midday trading in the stock market today.

350,SYMC,"Tech giant IBM (IBM) outplayed the cybersecurity industry in 2015, with its security sales ramping 12% to $2 billion, outpacing pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), and topping Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Fellow broad-based tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) also posted 12% growth in its security business in 2015, as the sector becomes more crucial to some of tech's biggest companies.IBM's overall sales fell 12% in 2015 to $81.5 billion, so the five-year-old security business still accounts for only 2.4% of total sales.In Q1, the pace quickened. IBM Security sales, on a constant currency basis, jumped 20% year over year to $400 million, where the company's overall revenue slipped 2% on a constant currency basis.Wall Street sees the beginning of a battle pitting IBM, Cisco and other giants salivating over the ripe cybersecurity market against the younger pure players, many of which aren't yet 10 years separated from their IPOs.After 100 days on the job -- which included acquiring incident response company Resilient Systems -- General Manager Marc van Zadelhoff says that IBM Security is ready for the donnybrook.In 2015, IBM Security hired 1,000 employees, bringing its staff to more than 7,000. This year, van Zadelhoff told IBD, he hopes to match that as IBM delves further into the red-hot cybersecurity game, backed by the company's Big Data, analytics and cognition expertise. He recently spoke with IBD.IBD: What key takeaways do you have after 100 days with IBM Security?Van Zadelhoff: I think we're in the sweet spot. I think when you move into a general manager chair managing 7,000 people, you get the vibe. And the vibe I get after 100 days is the team is really excited. Our customers are jazzed. We put an idea together five years ago. It's never been more clear than on my 100th day in this job that the idea is resonating with customers.IBD: Where is IBM Security excelling?Van Zadelhoff: What's working well is the unique combination of software, SaaS (software as a service) and services that we've built over the last five years. The core of the strategy was people needed something beyond the moats and castles, firewalls and antivirus. They needed analytics and intelligence in their software and in their managed service, and they needed not just technology, they needed people to help them transform. Over in Europe, we have so many customers where we have been in the midst of building their new security teams, their new security operations centers (SOCs). To handle modern security issues, you need a high-tech chief information security officer and office to deal with this, and that's what we've been building with our customers.IBD: How does security fit in with IBM's overall strategy?Van Zadelhoff: It's become a sizable unit within IBM that handles all the issues customers have in security. But it's also an integral part of some of these other businesses. We are incredibly active in securing customers' migration to IBM cloud. IBM cloud is growing very rapidly, and we are the security layer that people can use to move through the cloud. We are increasingly collaborating with (IBM supercomputer) Watson in the cognitive area. We have always been very important in helping to secure analytics and our Big Data business.And if you look at our global technology service and our outsourcing customers, we have a lot of partnerships including our products and services to help our outsourcing customers stay secure. Each part of IBM provides us the opportunity to talk about the security you need to go to as you're innovating. You cannot say no to innovation as a security team. The net (result) is security, is an integrated unit and (is) sprinkled across everything IBM is doing.IBD: How does IBM Security differentiate from pure players in the market?Van Zadelhoff: The average large customer has something like 100-150 security tools from 30-40 vendors. That's the history we saw five years ago when we put our strategy together. Fundamentally, our strategy is very simple. It is to put a different option on the table for customers, ones where they can adopt a system of capabilities that spans multiple areas. The part we've been doing in addition to being in 14 different segments of the market is we're meeting best in class.If you look at Forrester, Gartner, IDC, they would have us as an A leader or a B leader in virtually every one of those segments. Big is great, but you have to be best in class.And the third piece is integration. But we know we also have to integrate and be open. So we're integrated across our entire portfolio. We also have over 400 separate vendors who have integrated with the IBM Security stack.IBD: What cybersecurity trends do you see highlighting 2016?Van Zadelhoff: Customers are placing controls in place of security, but they're missing the big picture of a Big Data security platform and a team, a SOC (security operation center) that leverages Big Data analytics -- our QRadar platform -- and has the ability to hunt for the attacker as opposed to looking at historical data. We're enabling them to transform their security operations with forward and predictive analytics around attacks, compliance and insiders.I think this year will be the year of the SOC transformation that's going to be driven by the increase in ransomware, the increase in high-value data theft like health care data. It's ransomware, it's the theft of high-value data, it's the emergence of IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud -- all these things mean you have to have a highly-analytical SOC in place, and that's what we're helping customers to do.IBD: Obama is dedicating $3.1 billion to modernizing government cybersecurity infrastructures. How do you see the industry benefiting?Van Zadelhoff: I think what Obama and every CISO (chief information security officer) is realizing is that there are more intelligence systems available to do analytics but also to do identity and access management (IAM) -- where we have a leading portfolio -- patch management, mobile security or data security. We're too slow to adopt that. We're hanging on to 1980s versions of doing patch management, where you can't patch something for a month or two after finding a vulnerability in your system. Well, the technology in my portfolio can do that in an hour, so why are you using yesterday's technology to do that? We're seeing governments trying to catch up to the innovation in the private sector, and the money you mentioned will help the government to modernize.IBD: Will 2016 be a year of M&A in the cybersecurity industry, and how does IBM's recent acquisition of Resilient Systems fit into its strategy?Van Zadelhoff: I think you're going to continue to see acquisitions in the industry. We always weigh off buying capability, building it or partnering, and you've seen us do all flavors of that for the last 18 months. Where the industry has invested too little is in technology that does incident response. In those modern SOCs, because you're gathering so much data, by definition you're developing incidents.Those incidents, once you discover them, need to be resolved. You need the next step in the process; that's what Resilient does. Take 20,000 records leaked, for example, half in the U.K. and half in California. You detect that in your SOC, you bump that up into the Resilient app, and then Resilient will walk you through. ""The 10,000 records that were in the U.K.: Here's the regulator, here's the process, here's a lawyer, and here's what you have to do to inform the customers. For the ones in California, different regulatory regime, different process, different lawyer, here's how you get the resolution on that half of the incident.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

351,SYMC,"No. 1 cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) is expected early Wednesday to report its sixth consecutive quarter of 9% sales growth, but analysts model Q1 earnings decelerating to a single digit after four quarters of double-digit growth.For Q1, the consensus of 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projects Check Point posting $404.4 million in sales and $1.03 earnings per share ex items, up 9% and 8%, respectively. Three months ago, Check Point guided to $395 million-$410 million and 99 cents-$1.05.For 2016, the company models $1.72 billion to $1.79 billion in sales and $4.45-$4.45 EPS minus items, up a respective 8% and 9%.On a year-over-year basis, Check Point's sales have risen 9% for five straight quarters.The company's EPS has risen by at least 11% for four consecutive quarters. Check Point's Q1 deceleration would be the first in the past three quarters.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Check Point stock was down 1.5%, near 88, reflecting a 2% dip in IBD's 41-company Computer Software-Security industry group.Check Point is No. 1 in the group by market cap ($15.6 billion) and boasts a group-leading Composite Rating of 84 out of a best-possible 99. Last week, it broke out at an 88.59 buy point.Others leaders like Palo Alto Networks (PANW), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Symantec (SYMC) have middling CRs of 56, 50 and 44, respectively.

352,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) gouged rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) during Q1, as Fortinet (FTNT) and Symantec (SYMC) demand toppled, according to a Piper Jaffray survey of 26 resellers and distributors.Meanwhile, cybersecurity vendors Imperva (IMPV) and FireEye (FEYE) improved on Q4 demand, and CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Proofpoint (PFPT) demand remained relatively stable.Cybersecurity stocks largely fell on the stock market today, with IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group down 1.1%.Proofpoint fell 3.6% and Fortinet 3.8% Tuesday. Palo Alto Networks stock was down 1%. Imperva was down 2.9%, and FireEye fell 1.3%.Bucking the trend somewhat, Symantec was flat, CyberArk up fractionally and Check Point rose 0.7%.Meanwhile, Cisco Systems rose 0.1% after initially selling off on Juniper Networks' (JNPR) weak preliminary guidance late Monday.Check Point is losing to Palo Alto Networks, according to resellers surveyed by Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski, but half of the resellers cited Cisco as the rival Palo Alto Networks beats out most frequently.""Cisco and Check Point have consistently been called out by resellers as the vendors most frequently losing to Palo Alto,"" Nowinski wrote in a research report. In Q4 and Q3, Juniper Networks was also cited by 13% and 18% of resellers as losing to Palo Alto Networks.""However, this is the first quarter resellers cited Fortinet as competition to Palo Alto, suggesting Fortinet may be moving more upstream into the mid-market enterprise space,"" Nowinski wrote.Only 35% of resellers sold more Palo Alto Networks products than they expected, Nowinski wrote, down from 56% in Q4. The largest distributors say Palo Alto Networks demand trends were unchanged, he added.Imperva jumped in Q1, as 20% of resellers were above plan vs. 8% in Q4. And FireEye demand improved to 31% below plan from 36% in Q4. CyberArk and Proofpoint were largely in line.But Fortinet and Symantec declined. In Q1, 31% of Fortinet resellers were below plan vs. 14% in Q4. Symantec fell to 50% below plan vs. 29% in the prior quarter.

353,SYMC,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) wants organizational leaders to understand that improving their competitive advantage, not just responding to fear, should inspire their cybersecurity strategy.Fearful tales, however, are hard to ignore. One recent example: Virtually all IT systems of the largest civilian hospital chain in the nation’s capital, including the MedConnect electronic health records system installed by Cerner (CERN), were shut down to prevent the spread of a computer virus in late March.Baltimore-based MedStar Health on March 30 called it a “despicable attack.” The disruption affected thousands of employees and many more patients, and restoration of the systems took days.“Within 48 hours of the malware penetration,” the three main clinical systems were “moving to full restoration,” said MedStar. A Cerner spokeswoman told IBD: “We continue to work closely with our client (MedStar) as the broader IT framework is brought back online.”But a week later, MedStar was still working on it: “Our partner Symantec (SYMC) ... has been on the ground from the start of the situation and has been conducting a thorough forensic analysis,” MedStar said in an update last week, acknowledging it “has worked closely with the FBI throughout this situation.” The company again assured “that we have no evidence of any compromise of patient or associate data.” The Baltimore Sun reported the hospital’s hackers demanded ransom be paid in Bitcoin to unlock the hospital’s maliciously encrypted data.What a pain. What a danger. What a motivation for every organization to get its cybersecurity in order, as if another example were needed.“We’re very familiar with it,” James Mobley, a Cisco security services vice president, told IBD in an interview last week, acknowledging MedStar is a Cisco client.Cisco, the No. 1 maker of computer networking gear and with a growing business in security, plans early next month to release a security survey of business executives. The company says productivity, growth and competitive advantage ought to be motivating cybersecurity decisions, not just fear.Its report, originally set for release early Tuesday, is titled “Nearly One-Third of Businesses View Cybersecurity Primarily as a Growth Enabler.” Silicon Valley-based Cisco, which briefed IBD and other media on the report, found that only a bit more than 30% of 1,014 corporate directors, vice presidents and C-level executives surveyed online “view cybersecurity primarily as an enabler of growth tied to digitization.“Security-led digitizers feel more prepared than others to address cybersecurity challenges in three key digital technology areas: analytics, Internet of Things and cloud computing,"" Cisco said. “As a result, these organizations are far more confident about incorporating digital technologies into their business processes and offerings.""In fact, 44% of executives surveyed consider cybersecurity to be a competitive advantage for their organizations.”Cisco said cybersecurity will drive about $7.6 trillion of digital value over the next decade, with $5.8 trillion resulting from “cybersecurity’s enablement of digital use cases that instigate innovation and growth.”Is this marketing pablum or a legitimate call to action? Cisco has been under pressure to grow as fast as some of the smaller networking and software security firms with which it competes or partners.In its fiscal 2015 ended July 25, Cisco’s overall revenue rose only 4% to $49.16 billion, but its security services sales alone grew 12% to $1.75 billion. Medical IT leader Cerner grew 2015 revenue 30% to $4.42 billion, in part by selling P2Sentinnel and P2Sentinel Security as a Service (P2SaaS) products as a “security, auditing and compliance solution for tracking end-user access to confidential patient data in Mellennium, as well as other non-Cerner clinical solutions and infrastructure systems.”Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which specializes in security software, grew sales 55% last year. Rival Check Point Software (CHKP) saw revenue rise 9%. Symantec, MedStar’s prime cybersecurity contractor, reported pro forma revenue fell 6.3% year over year for its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 1, adjusting for the sale of its Veritas business.Cisco’s survey data could serve as grist for its hungry marketing-sales machine, but it also provides a heads-up to companies that there’s more to cybersecurity than preventing hacker disruption. When a company is confident it can prevent disruption, this enables minds to focus on everything else.“It’s critically important that we stop thinking about security as a defense-centric approach that is sold by fear, uncertainty and doubt,” Mike Dahn, head of data security for payments firm Square (SQ), said in Cisco's survey results press release. “We need to start thinking about security as an enablement of innovation that actually helps the business go forward.”Cisco stock touched a nearly one-year low of 22.46 in early February, but it has been on an upswing recently. Cisco closed Monday at 27.62, down a fraction.In the meantime, cybersecurity continues to be top of mind. By executive order, the U.S. Commerce Department will host its first Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity meeting on Thursday in Washington, D.C.

354,SYMC,"Major averages were mixed early Thursday, as pressure from overseas markets supplemented reaction to earnings reports and a weak Q1 GDP estimate.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2% and the Nasdaq edged higher.The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to hold interest rates unchanged appeared to be a mild positive for stocks.The stock market today received a mixed early nudge from the Labor Department, which estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%. That was a sharp drop from Q4's 1.4% growth and just below consensus projections for a 0.7% gain. The GDP price index, which gauge's inflation, rose 0.7%, below views for a 0.9% increase.The Labor Department also said unemployment claims climbed to 257,000 in the week ended April 23, up from 248,000 in the prior week, but below estimates for 260,000 claims. The four-week moving average ticked lower to 256,000 --  its lowest level since 1973.Oil traded flat early Thursday after rising 3% Wednesday to leave West Texas Intermediate just above $45 a barrel. Gold gained almost 1%, to above $1,258 an ounce.  Bonds rose, sending the 10-year yield down 2 basis points to 1.83%.The dollar traded lower, particularly against the yen, which spiked sharply after the Bank of Japan surprisingly announced no change to its current stimulus program. The decision sent Tokyo's Nikkei 225 down 3.6%. China's markets closed narrowly mixed, but the losses in Japan spun out into trading in Europe. Eurozone markets traded down more than 1% in afternoon trading. London's FTSE 100 was down 0.9%.UnitedHealth (UNH) bucked the trend in the Dow, rising 0.6%. Early laggards included DuPont (DD), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC).Medical deal news made early headlines.St. Jude Medical (STJ) spiked 25% after Abbott Labs (ABT) agreed to buy the St. Paul, Minn.-based heart device maker in a deal valued at $25 billion. Abbott shares slipped 7%.San Francisco-based biomed Medivation (MDVN) jumped 7% after news reports said France's Sanofi (SNY) offered to buy the company in a $9.3 billion deal. Dow Jones reported Sanofi opted to take the news public after Medivation's management declined the unsolicited offer. Sanofi traded down 2%. Medivation is an IBD 50 stock.Check out Medivation's technical and fundamental vital signs using IBD's Stock Checkup feature.St. Jude led the S&P 500, followed by Facebook (FB), which swept up 10%. Facebook's Q1 results easily cleared analyst forecasts, with a 52% revenue gain and an 83% advance in adjusted earnings. Facebook gapped up over a 117.09 buy point early Thursday.Losses were equally dramatic. Cybersecurity outfit Symantec (SYMC) lost 6% in early action. The Mountain View, Calif., company lowered its fiscal Q4 sales and earnings guidance, and it announced the resignation of CEO Michael Brown, who will continue to act as chief executive until a successor is found, the company said.PayPal (PYPL) added nearly 3% after a positive Q1 report late Wednesday. The stock has been fighting to get some lift from an alternate entry at 40.03.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) fell furthest, down nearly 4%. The auto parts chain reported late Wednesday its Q1 sales and earnings topped consensus forecasts. But management guided Q2 earning below expectations.Nutritional supplement chain GNC (GNC) dived 26% after delivering a Q1 miss on its earnings, while revenue slipped slightly less than expected. Full-year EPS guidance was below prior guidance and far below consensus views. Management cited challenges in the company's vitamin lines and said the challenges would continue for the remainder of the year. GNC had managed a 54% climb off a January low through Wednesday, but remained well below an August high.
"
355,SYMC,"Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) CEO Gil Shwed tipped the domino in 1994 when he unveiled the world's first commercially available firewall. Ten years later, CyberArk Software (CYBR) jumped into the nascent privileged-account security field.Their commonality?Both are based in security-minded Israel and led by men with military backgrounds. Both have also outperformed the sluggish 2016 cybersecurity market that, in January, was tugged down by gloomy guidance from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). Wall Street quickly panicked, fearing a big slowdown in IT spending.IBD's 41-company Computer Software-Security industry group is down a collective 11% this year. Check Point stock withstood the fall and is up 6.6% year to date. CyberArk stock is down, but by just 6.4%.That's not to say non-Israeli cybersecurity firms didn't also buck the trend. Symantec (SYMC) stock is up 9%. Shares of Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have fallen a fraction and 8.5%, respectively, also outperforming the sector overall.As the industry recovers, BlueStar Global Investors analyst Joshua Kaplan says investors should turn to the Israeli security software companies Check Point, CyberArk, Imperva (IMPV) and Radware (RDWR) for innovative products and rising earnings.""Israel is in a rough neighborhood. It's surrounded by enemies on all three sides,"" Kaplan told IBD. For that reason, cybersecurity ""is a critical part of Israel's military edge.""Check Point was borne out of Shwed's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) service, where he was a member of Intelligence Corps Unit 8200. But he began coding long before that: At age 12, he took a coding position at a language-translation software company, according to online news magazine Israel21c.Udi Mokady, too, served in the IDF military intelligence unit before he was tapped to lead CyberArk in 2005. CyberArk made its IPO in 2014, opened at 25 -- above the 16 listing price -- and ramped 26% in its first two days.(Note that Israeli cybersecurity firms aren't alone with a military influence at the top. Silicon Valley-based Palo Alto Networks CEO Mark McLaughlin served in the U.S. Army, where he flew an attack helicopter before his 2011 appointment to that security firm's top spot.)Israel's innovative tech stems largely from required military service, Kaplan says, noting the silos separating private, public and government sectors are less clear-cut than those in the U.S. Those military skills typically translate well to the private sector.Shwed did as much with his firewall, originally an airtight setup to tie two top-secret Israeli military computer networks. He launched Check Point's firewall -- a software system designed to monitor a network and keep out any unauthorized users -- shortly before Silicon Valley-based Cisco Systems (CSCO) entered the perimeter market.Now, Kaplan says U.S. and other firms will have to innovate as quickly as their Israeli counterparts to keep pace. The cybersecurity sector is poised for a shake-up as the industry matures, and a number of companies may not survive, he said.""IT spending is not going to drop, it's going to stabilize at a higher level than it was before,"" he told IBD. ""When an industry's growth starts to slow down a little bit, sometimes there's forced consolidation and companies that just don't make it.""Check Point is going to stay ahead of that curve by pushing into the platform market. ""Platform"" is currently the word du jour for the industry, with pure players and tech giants alike touting their wholesale approach to security.Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, IBM (IBM), FireEye (FEYE) and many others market security platforms.""There are going to be several companies who are industry leaders and who gain share,"" Kaplan said. ""But I do believe Check Point started this initiative first.""Cloud-based security firm Imperva also ramped up after its 2011 IPO priced at 18, jumping 47% on day one and peaking last November above 77.Imperva has a heavy focus on data center security. Over the years, though, the stock has had big up and down moves after earnings, Kaplan says. Now that the industry's highest growth, at least for now, seems to have passed, he says it's unlikely Imperva will gain much notoriety.""I'm not sure Imperva is ever going to be a household name,"" he said. ""And Radware, I don't think it's ever really going to get that investor excitement that it should have.""But the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security (HACK) ETF has helped some under-the-radar security firms get noticed, Kaplan says.""Until the HACK ETF came along, a lot of people probably hadn't heard of the other three Israeli cybersecurity companies outside of Check Point,"" he said. ""That's the reason you want to be invested in these companies. Maybe they weren't on your radar before, and they should have been.""The PureFunds Cyber Security ETF debuted in 2014 and is down 7% this year, after taking some software-related licks in January. Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, stresses the fund's diversification.""Before we launched, there was a lot of demand for investing in cybersecurity, but being it's a constantly adapting, evolving and changing industry, many people don't understand the companies, their products and services,"" he told IBD.PureFunds tries to do the investing legwork. The HACK ETF currently features 35 distinctive cybersecurity firms, including Check Point, CyberArk, Imperva and Radware. But Chanin questions whether investors know -- or care -- that the four are Israeli.Israel is an obvious tech hub, ""but (the companies) weren't going around saying, 'Hey, we're an Israeli company, use us,' "" he said.More than ever, big tech companies are taking the security plunge, Chanin says, and acquisition rumors are rumbling, including talk that Check Point might be eyeing CyberArk.""We've seen many larger, diversified companies come out and say it's a goal of theirs to increase their cybersecurity footprint,"" Chanin said. ""Building something organically isn't easy and acquisitions could save time and money in that plan.""

357,SYMC,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) was trading down sharply Tuesday after it announced late Monday that longtime CEO Jay Flatley was leaving his post.Flatley plans to become executive chairman of Illumina on July 5, at which point the current president, Francis deSouza, will become CEO. Flatley has headed Illumina since 1999, shortly after its founding, and has overseen its debut on the stock market and its rise to a multibillion-dollar company. DeSouza joined in 2013 from Symantec (SYMC), which had acquired his startup IMlogic.BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote that deSouza was generally expected to succeed Flatley, but perhaps not yet.""Mr. deSouza has been prominently featured within the investor community over the past 12 months, and his ascension to be Jay’s successor is unlikely to be a surprise for most investors,"" Leone wrote in a research note. ""However, we do think that the timing of the transition is sooner than expected.""Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote that continuity is likely the theme of the transition.""We believe that this transition was long telegraphed to the market and should come as no surprise to shareholders,"" Muken wrote in his research note. ""With respect to Jay, the executive chairman title also likely signals his continued close involvement in the business, albeit the need for him to focus on bigger picture concepts . . . vs. day to day execution.""Nonetheless, Illumina stock was down more than 4% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 155. The stock had been recovering from a four-month low of 130.37 hit on Feb. 8, but retains a dismal IBD Relative Strength Rating of 29 despite a strong EPS Rank of 79.

358,SYMC,"Billions of Apple (AAPL) iPhones and iPads could be exposed in an iOS 9 vulnerability, Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) researchers announced early Thursday, in preparation of presenting their findings at Singapore's Black Hat Asia 2016 conference late Thursday U.S. time.Enterprise applications installed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) software are exempt from Apple’s latest security changes, which means that an attacker can hijack legitimate communications to install malicious apps, says the security firm.It’s still theoretical, Avi Rembaum, Check Point vice president of security solutions, told IBD on Wednesday. Black Hat gives researchers an opportunity to discuss hypothetical threat vectors, including this new so-called ""SideStepper"" vulnerability.""Unfortunately, a lot of those things we talk about that might happen often end up happening,"" he said.Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. Apple stock was down a fraction in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today.Apple recognized a key piece of the SideStepper vulnerability in iOS 8. For $299 a year, an enterprise can purchase an Apple certificate to upload a private app via the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.""But if someone is going to be malicious, they don’t really care about signing a (certificate) agreement, plus it’s $299 per year to get that certificate,"" Rembaum said. ""There weren't many barriers to entry.""Enterprises are headily embracing the ""Bring Your Own Device"" trend and, in one case study of a Fortune 100 company, Check Point found 318 private apps and 116 unique certificates on employees' devices. Those numbers were suspiciously high, Rembaum said.""When we looked deeper ... they were on the sketchier side and were from parts of the world that could be problematic,"" he said. ""We saw a very small number of them that would be considered white-listed (trustworthy).""So in iOS 9, Apple upped the challenges to installation, says Check Point. But the new challenges don’t cover MDM-pushed updates to employees’ devices. Of the 1.2 billion installed iPhones and iPads, 79% have iOS installed and are therefore vulnerable.Enterprises often rely on MDM services like those by BlackBerry (BBRY) (via its Good Technology acquisition), VMWare (VMW) and MobileIron (MOBL) to push updates onto employees’ devices, thereby avoiding the ""headache"" of ensuring that every app has identical settings, Rembaum said.That MDM-device connection, however, is also a powerful portal for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, he said. A hacker can, theoretically, intercept the communications between MDM and device to install a certificate and then a malicious app.Often, the interception relies on social engineering, he said.""An attacker would send a text message to the target with a link to download the configuration file,"" he said. ""It would install a certificate and configuration instructions in the phone. The only thing the user has to do is say yes to installing.""Then the attacker is in -- with access to a user's address book, microphone, photos, GPS, apps and, possibly, company data.Rembaum recommends that MDM users take a ""multilayer approach"" to mobile security. Because hackers often rely on social engineering to launch phishing attacks -- by email, text message or social media -- enterprises should train employees on red flags.Phishing attacks cost businesses more than $215 million between October 2013 and December 2014, according to a January report by the FBI.This month, Seagate Technology (STX) discovered that it had been duped into handing out nearly 10,000 W-2 forms belonging to former and current employees. The Seagate revelation came on the heels of a similar attack on privately held Snapchat.Scammers often change a single letter in an email address or impersonate a CEO's email address, Barracuda Networks’ (CUDA) Slawek Ligier and Proofpoint’s (PFPT) Ryan Kalember told IBD.Outside education, an enterprise can install Check Point’s Mobile Threat Prevention (MTP) software and have its employees install the ZoneAlarm app, Rembaum said. FireEye (FEYE), Symantec (SYMC), Intel’s (INTC) McAfee, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Proofpoint also compete in the mobile security space.A MitM attacker creates an encrypted tunnel -- typically through a virtual private network (VPN) -- to its own site, directing a user away from the legitimate MDM. Check Point’s MTP solution hunts down that encrypted tunnel.""The user would have received the text, clicked on the link and installed the certificate,"" Rembaum said. ""Then (Check Point’s software) would reach out and block the connection.""He added: ""The actual installation of the malware wouldn’t have succeeded.""

359,SYMC,"Stocks posted healthy gains in quiet volume Friday, as the S&P 500 moved back into positive territory for the week.Gains were even across the board as the Dow industrials, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 0.9% apiece. Small caps ran slightly ahead of the crowd, with the Russell 2000 rising 1.1%.Volume got off to a weak start in the stock market today, down about 9% each on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Thursday.Import prices slipped 0.3%, and export prices dropped 0.4% in February, the Labor Department reported just ahead of the open. Both numbers were less than forecast by analyst consensus, which projected import prices down 0.8% and exports off 0.5%.Dow stocks were all about the upside early Friday, with the worst move on the index a 0.2% gain by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). Goldman Sachs (GS) rose the most, up 1.6%.Symantec (SYMC) scrambled up more than 4%, leading the Nasdaq 100. RBC Capital Markets upgraded the security software developer to outperform from sector perform and set its price target at 23. The move puts Symantec up 11% so far this week. Shares are back above both their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of an eight month consolidation.Also on the Nasdaq 100, Viacom (VIAB) and Baidu (BIDU) knocked out 3% gains.Columbia Pipeline Group (CPGX) topped the S&P 500, jumping 5% for a 15% gain so far this week, powered by news reports of possible merger talks with TransCanada (TRP). TransCanada shares were up less than 1% in early trade.Among IBD 50 stocks, J2 Global (JCOM) rebounded 5% after diving 20% in response to a negative note from short-sale researcher Citron on Thursday. J2 management declared Citron's assertion that J2's growth had relied on mergers and acquisitions, funded by the company's legacy fax business and generating no organic growth.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) popped more than 4% in strong trade. It continues to fight for breathing room above its converged 10- and 40-week moving averages, just below a 106.08 buy point in a double-bottom base.Broadcom (AVGO) rolled a better-than-3% gain in heavy trade, nearing a new high and rising 7% above a 138.70 buy point from a double-bottom base.Only a few IBD stocks declined, holding their losses to less than 1%.

360,SYMC,"Biogen (BIIB) got a lower price target Friday following bad news about its best-selling drug, while software security firms FireEye (FEYE) and Symantec (SYMC) got positive analyst moves, and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) price target was raised.Baird lowered its price target on Biogen to 268 from 316 and maintained its neutral rating on the stock. On Thursday, an analyst at Cowen & Co. said that a European court revoked a patent on Biogen’s multiple-sclerosis drug Tecfidera,the biotech’s biggest moneymaker. Biogen officials said the firm will appeal the decision, according to news reports Friday morning.Biogen shares climbed 3.1% to 259.74 on the stock market today. The stock is 46% off its March 20, 2015 peak, but it really broke down starting in late July.FireEye’s price target was raised to 18 by Baird, which maintained its neutral rating on the stock. Earlier this week, the security software firm said it expects to see profits in 2017 amid a transition to a software-as-a-service subscription model. Shares rose back above their 50-day line on Feb. 29, ending an 8-month run below that level.FireEye shares rose 4.6% to 18.27.Fellow security software maker Symantec climbed 3.9% to 18.39 after it was upgraded to outperform from sector perform by RBC Capital Markets, which has a 23 price target on the stock. Symantec  is at its best levels since last August, breaking a downtrend that started in January 2015. Shares soared through their 200-day line this week.Meanwhile, another security software firm, Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), was initiated at underperform with a 65 price target. Check Point shares rose 0.1% to 83.Shares of Ulta Beauty soared 17.3% to 191.62, rocketing to a new high Friday. Ulta's price target was hiked to 215 from 210 by Telsey Advisory Group, which has an outperform rating on the stock. Late Thursday, the beauty products retailer topped earnings views and offered full-year revenue and earnings guidance above consensus.Dollar General's (DG) price target was raised to 89 from 83 at Telsey Advisory Group, which rates the stock an outperform. Dollar General's stock rose 2.1% to 85.01, hitting another high.Shares of the deep discount retailer popped 11% to a new closing high of 83.23 on Thursday  after it topped quarterly earnings views and offered upbeat guidance for this year.

361,SYMC,"Proofpoint (PFPT) rebuffed Wall Street concerns that tech spending has slowed this quarter, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote Monday, following last week's 40,000-attendance cybersecurity RSA Conference in San Francisco.Fears of a tech spending depression slugged IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group after dismal outlooks by Tableau Software (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD) last month. The group hit a 20-month low on Feb. 9 but has since risen 31%.A weak spending outlook did not play out at RSA, Nowinski and William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote Monday in separate research reports.""(Proofpoint) management said they are seeing 'absolutely no change in the buying environment,'"" Nowinski wrote. ""Based on our meetings at the conference, we believe demand trends in Q1 have remained strong through the first two months of the year.""Trending buzzwords include endpoint security, internal access management and privileged account management, Nowinski wrote. Symantec (SYMC), FireEye (FEYE) and IBM (IBM) (via a partnership with Carbon Black) compete in the endpoint market.Industry tracker IDC sees endpoint security revenue reaching $4.6 billion in 2016, up 5.4% and accelerating from 2% year-over-year growth in 2015, Nowinski wrote.Despite a marketing refresh, Symantec will struggle against ""rapidly growing next-generation endpoint vendors that have demonstrated stronger solutions,"" Ho predicted. FireEye, on the other hand, bolstered its threat-prevention capabilities by adding exploit detection to its endpoint.IDC also expects internal access management revenue to reach $5.9 billion in 2016 and grow at an 8% compound annual growth rate through 2019. Within that sector, privileged account management will comprise $550 million, growing at a 10.6% CAGR over the next four years, Ho says.CyberArk Software (CYBR) rivals Centrify in the identity access management ring, Nowinski wrote. But Centrify's tools for securing both privileged accounts and end-user identity give it a broader portfolio than CyberArk, he wrote.During RSA, CyberArk released a new version of its privileged threat analytics system, aimed at stopping ""Golden Ticket"" attacks which exploit privileged credentials in Microsoft (MSFT) domain-level administrator accounts, Ho wrote.Ho also noted that a platform focus continues to buoy Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which he says still wins ""bake-offs"" against Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).But Check Point's software-based firewall could be a game changer, he wrote.""Check Point's software-based firewall appears better positioned than competitors for the upcoming shift to third-party cloud architectures such as AWS (Amazon (AMZN) Web Service) and (Microsoft) Azure,"" he said.Ultimately, the RSA Conference quelled concerns of slowing spending and lengthening sales cycles, Ho wrote. RSA saw 70 first-time exhibitors, giving it 500 companies at the event, and more than 20% growth from 33,000 attendees in 2015.""We observed continued excitement over the space and a strong appetite for new solutions, consistent with prior years,"" Ho wrote. ""Our discussions with private and public companies suggest that the environment remains robust and that security spending has not weakened near term.""Overall themes included the burgeoning Internet of Things market, encryption, third-party cloud security, identity/access management as-a-service, real-time visibility, next-generation endpoint security, automation/orchestration and leveraging Big Data analytics, Ho wrote.""The conference reinforced our view that the companies best positioned to benefit from increased spending are those that offer innovative next-generation approaches that will see rapid growth in investment,"" he wrote.Customers are looking at cost, manageability and vendor consolidation, Ho wrote.

362,SYMC,"SAN FRANCISCO -- CyberArk (CYBR) CEO Udi Mokady surveyed the crowd. A man decked in a traditional Native American headdress passed the booth -- his movement highlighted by the nearby fire-truck-red semitrailer that Fortinet (FTNT) rolled in as its booth, and Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) towering blue signage.Tweeted photos show a bright orange fox touting social media security firm ZeroFOX. Open-source manager Black Duck Software handed out ""What the (Duck)"" T-shirts. And the entire event was overshadowed by a Terminator-Darth Vader mash-up mascot.""A lot of CEOs don't even walk the floor,"" Mokady told IBD at the annual cybersecurity RSA Conference in San Francisco's Moscone Center convention hall. ""But there are a lot of meetings that set the tone for the year, (there are) relationships happening behind closed doors.""If the RSA Conference sets the tone for the cybersecurity industry, 2016 will be marked by roaring noise -- mostly in marketing. But execs tend to agree the overarching themes for the year will center on technological leaps and possible collaboration.""Platform"" is a buzzword for a reason, Needham analyst Scott Zeller wrote in a research report after Palo Alto Networks last month crushed Wall Street's Q2 expectations. The broad-based platform approach works in security.But Palo Alto wasn't the only vendor lauding its platform-centric approach at the RSA Conference. An overwhelming majority of companies -- IBM (IBM), FireEye (FEYE) and Fortinet included -- touted their platforms.Consumers are confused, Fortinet threat researcher Derek Manky told IBD. That's where third-party testing comes into play. Fortinet calls it a ""security fabric,"" which integrates Fortinet's firewall with threat intelligence data from FortiGuard researchers.""We can say how good we are, but there are a lot of third-party vendors that are doing validation of security,"" he said.A recent test by NSS Labs ranked Fortinet's FortiGuard 3200D and Check Point Software Technology's (CHKP) 13800 NGFW Appliance as top products, blocking 99.6% of all exploits. The lab examined 13 leading products comprising 96% of the next-generation firewall market.Palo Alto Networks' PA-7050 scooted in with 95.9% effectiveness, trailing a Juniper Networks (JNPR) offering and two Cisco Systems (CSCO) products with a respective 98%, 96.5% and 96.3% scores.Confusion is lending itself to the advent of software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, former iSight Partners CEO John Watters told IBD. FireEye acquired iSight in January for $275 million and retained Watters and much of the iSight leadership team.Watters sees SaaS making a play for the platform market.""The big trends line is customers are moving from best-in-class niche product to best-in-class platform,"" he said. ""And they're moving from a self-serve model to an as-a-service model.""That shift benefits FireEye. New FireEye-as-a-Service billings nearly doubled in 2015 vs. 2014, CFO Michael Berry told analysts during the company's Q4 earnings conference call in February.Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Intel (INTC) Security and Symantec (SYMC) are leading a sector push to share threat intelligence data across the map. In 2014, the quartet became odd bedfellows in a security collaboration dubbed ""the Cyber Threat Alliance.""Davis Hake, Palo Alto Networks director of cybersecurity strategy, told IBD the group's goal is to reduce the noise generated by low-level, easy-to-launch attacks.""We take that data back out, and we work to democratize it with the rest of the security community,"" he said. ""It allows us to understand, across the community, attackers' game plans against all of these other entities.""Palo Alto Networks CEO Mark McLaughlin, on the company's recent earnings call, said the days of monetizing threat data are over. A company's value stems from its overall platform, he says.Watters disagrees: ""All the people that are driving sharing are people who don't have a bunch of intellectual property,"" he said. ""Everybody is filling up each other's in-boxes with all the same stuff. It's all the machine-generated event data.""ISight fits into a detection hole in FireEye's model, he explained.""We detect ... everything that leads up the time they hit enter on the keyboard,"" he said. ""As soon as they hit enter, we went blind because we didn't have attack surface monitoring.""FireEye's incident response leg, Mandiant, sees the attack itself, watching how hackers escalate privileges, jump firewalls and burrow through systems. ISight detects the attack prep and follows the fallout on the black market.That intelligence is proprietary, Watters said. Because of that, FireEye doesn't need to reboot its software every several years; the software is updated every hour. Fortinet makes a similar boast, noting its FortiGuard research updates systems every five minutes.Artificial intelligence (AI) won't look like Haley Joel Osment in the 2001 Steven Spielberg flick. Rather, machine-learning will be bolstered by data-heavy Internet of Things devices, Sol Cates, chief security officer for encryption specialist Vormetric, told IBD.The trend could boost the chip sector. Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) forged alliances with Facebook (FB) and Chinese Internet major Alibaba (BABA) during Q4 for speedy intelligence chips, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said during last month.Just as ""platform"" is a commonplace buzzword, so too are Big Data, the Internet of Things and the cloud, Cates says. But they'll also be integral to future technology -- and that's either a boon or a bust for the cybersecurity industry.AI generates two big questions for the sector, Cates said.""How do we protect the sensitive data going in? And how do we harness it for security?"" he asked. The problem is, the cybersecurity industry often trails innovation. ""We have to figure it out after the fact, and we're not yet experts on it.""IBM, which just acquired Resilient Systems, plans to push machine-learning to accelerate automated penetration testing, Marc van Zadelhoff, the company's security general manager, told IBD. Penetration testing -- purposefully probing a system for vulnerabilities -- will become more and more necessary in the security world as the BYOD (bring your own device) trend opens more endpoints.Gemalto exec David Etue argued during an RSA lecture that software updates could right the likely-to-occur wrongs as the cybersecurity sector tackles the Internet of Things market.""If we get this right, this puts us in a position for long-term success,"" he said.Fortinet's Manky says wrangling the Internet of Things and protecting Big Data will be more complicated than that. Industry experts estimate 20 billion-30 billion Internet-capable devices will come online in the next four years.""That generates a lot of noise, and there's a lot of traffic, you need to inspect all of that,"" Manky said. ""Anything and everything is a target now. ... If you think of any device that has an Internet connection, it's got memory, it has a processor and a connection, and that's all hackers need to go after (it).""

363,SYMC,"SAN FRANCISCO -- No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is diving deeper into the red-hot cybersecurity sector by partnering with U.K.-based credentials manager Intercede to eradicate usernames and passwords, the companies announced Tuesday.Intel stock lifted 2.6% on the stock market today, outperforming a respective 2.1% and 2.9% recovery on the Dow Jones and Nasdaq. The announcement stemmed from the annual RSA Conference in San Francisco, where Intel is presenting the technology.Intercede's mini-driver and virtual-reader software -- pieces of the private company's MyID platform -- will be integrated into Intel Authenticate, a hardware-based multifactor-authentication system. The system runs on Intel's sixth-generation processor.Multifactor authentication is a growing sector under the cybersecurity umbrella, with offerings from EMC (EMC) and Symantec (SYMC) on the public side and SecureAuth, Okta and Vasco Data Security International on the private side.But SecureAuth Chief Technology Officer Keith Graham told IBD that the enterprise industry is moving beyond mere multifactor authentication which uses at least two pieces of data to confirm a user's identity. SecureAuth recently unveiled behavioral biometric authentication -- a first, they say.Behavioral biometric authentication involves analyzing a user's typical keystroke and mouse-movement patterns to verify identity.""It's about adaptive access control,"" Graham said. ""Multifactor is great but it still hinders user experience and users don't want to be hindered. . . . So good luck to Intel, but they may have some catching up to do.""The Intel-Intercede program could involve a biometric, however, Intercede products manager Iain Wotherspoon told IBD. Upon a first logon attempt, the user will be prompted to enter a PIN number managed via Intel Authenticate.Intercede's MyID allows that logon to take place in any Microsoft (MSFT) Windows system or domain, Wotherspoon said. From there, an enterprise can opt to add other factors for authentication.""It could be something you have, the computer; something you know, the PIN number; and something you are, a fingerprint,"" Wotherspoon said.MyID was the first electronic personification system to achieve FIPS 201 compliance, according to a press release from Intel and Intercede. The federal standard is required for technology used by federal employees and contractors.Intercede CEO Richard Parris praised the combined tech as a ""cost-effective, easy to deploy"" system for global enterprises.""It's becoming widely recognized that passwords are insecure and no longer a viable nor effective solution to combat cyber attacks in the enterprise sector,"" Parris said in an email. ""Collaborations like this are a necessity to create more robust and secure solutions to address one of the most pressing business issues of our time.""Tom Garrison, vice president and general manager of Intel's business client division, noted the advancements in the Authenticate tech.""We're excited to advance our work on Intel Authenticate, working with premier security companies like Intercede,"" he said in the release. ""Together, we're empowering enterprise to not only dramatically improve identity security, but to do so in a way that improves the ease of use and experience for the business professional.""

364,SYMC,"Tech giant IBM (IBM) plans to undercut Cisco Systems (CSCO), Symantec (SYMC), FireEye (FEYE) and Rapid7 (RPD) by acquiring incident response firm Resilient Systems and partnering with endpoint security provider Carbon Black, the company announced Monday.The announcement comes a week after IBM unveiled a deeper tie to No. 1 cybersecurity pure-play Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) to pool research and integrate systems. IBM stock slipped 0.8% to close at 131.03 on the stock market today.IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down a fraction Monday as companies headed to the RSA Conference, a massive cybersecurity industry gathering that runs all week in San Francisco.Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security, described the Resilient Systems acquisition as the cornerstone of a three-prong strategy to protect, defend and respond to cyberbreaches. Per IBM policy, he wouldn't disclose the price tag for the privately held, 100-employee company.""This ultimately gives us the ability to expand from protecting and defending the enterprise to also being able to respond to a breach,"" Barlow told IBD. ""This combination of a new acquisition and the associated partnerships really make a move into the incident-response space.""In conjunction with the acquisition, IBM will partner with endpoint security firm Carbon Black. Privately held Carbon Black owns 37% of the endpoint market, according to industry tracker IDC. Carbon Black's platform will allow IBM analysts to conduct security forensics on compromised endpoint devices.Resilient Systems will be integrated into IBM's incident-response platform, dubbed X-Force Incident Response Services. Via X-Force, IBM will counsel clients through all parts of a cyberbreach and on ways to avoid such breaches.Barlow likened the service to a fire drill.""Most companies don't have good incident-response plans,"" he said. ""There's a binder on the shelf for what to do in the case of a fire or what to do in the case of a flood, but not necessarily what to do in the case of a cyber incident.""That ""binder"" includes pertinent leadership, disclosure and public relations keys in case of a breach, he said. IBM's move allows the company to ""pivot"" from protecting and defending to responding to a breach, he says. It's all part of IBM's push into the cybersecurity market.In 2015, IBM pulled in $2 billion in security revenue. That was up 12% but still accounted for only 2.4% of IBM's total revenue of more than $81 billion, which fell 12%. But the dollar amount topped total sales for security pure-players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye. And IBM's security business also outgrew Symantec and Check Point.The security unit was launched four years ago, Barlow says. Since then, it has added 7,300 employees -- 1,000 last year alone -- and operates in 133 countries globally.""Imagine if that were the conversation about a Silicon Valley startup,"" he said.IBM gets a not-strong IBD Composite Rating of 53 out of a possible 99. Shares are down 5% year to date, like the S&P 500 index.

365,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) stock rallied late Thursday after the cybersecurity firm reported fiscal-third-quarter sales and earnings that topped Wall Street views, while also announcing a that it will get a $500 million investment from private equity firm Silver Lake Management. In after-hours trading, Symantec stock jumped more than 9%, trading near 21 after closing down a fraction during regular-session trading. Shares were down 8.7% for the year…

366,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) Q3 sales are expected to dip below $1 billion for the first time since 2007, and Wall Street will closely watch the company’s Q4 outlook, which follows the completed sale of its data storage unit Veritas late last month. Intraday on the stock market today, Symantec stock was down fractionally ahead of the Q3 earnings report due late Thursday.…

367,SYMC,"Investors heaved a collective sigh late Thursday, relieved that a slowdown in network security spending didn't batter Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which delivered view-crushing fiscal Q2 earnings on its simplified platform approach.Midday on the stock market today, Palo Alto Networks stock was up 2%, near 143, after earlier rising as much as 9.7%. IBD's 41-company Computer Software-Security industry group rose as much as 4% in early trading Friday.For its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 31, Palo Alto reported 40 cents earnings per share ex items on $334.7 million in sales, up 110.5% and 54%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus view for 39 cents and $318.3 million.Sales and EPS growth, however, decelerated for the second consecutive quarter.During Q2, Palo Alto reported record billings growth of 62% year over year to $459 million, vs. consensus expectation for $417 million, Needham analyst Scott Zeller wrote in a research report.Zeller maintained his buy rating but cut his price target on Palo Alto Networks stock to 171 from 202. Palo Alto Networks isn't a ""fad"" in security, but the company will likely face some challenges in continuing billings acceleration, he wrote.Billings accelerated on 2,000 added customers and a 68% jump in subscription sales to $84.3 million. But Palo Alto Networks is a ""victim of its own success,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens wrote in a report.Palo Alto Networks cut its fiscal 2016 operating margin guidance to 18%-19% vs. earlier views for 22%-25%, noting commissions on subscription sales will impact sales-and-marketing expenses. Those expenses jumped by $16 million sequentially in Q2.""The upshot is strong free cash flow and free cash flow margin,"" Owens wrote. The company expects 40% free cash flow margin in Q3, suggesting fiscal 2016 free cash flow should reach $730 million, according to Zeller.Current-quarter guidance for $335 million-$339 million in sales topped Wall Street views for $334.9 million. But the EPS outlook for 41-42 cents missed analysts' consensus forecast for 45 cents.Sales and EPS would be up 44% and 80%, respectively, at the midpoints of Palo Alto Networks' guidance and are expected to decelerate for the third consecutive quarter.Yet Palo Alto Networks' Q2 sales increased by 50%-plus for the seventh consecutive quarter, and billings surged to the highest point in 11 straight quarters, amid concerns of a slowdown in security spending.A ""paradigm shift"" from legacy systems is buoying Palo Alto Networks, CEO Mark McLaughlin told analysts on the company's earnings conference call late Thursday. He sees Palo Alto Networks taking share from Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Juniper Networks (JNPR). Some analysts tend to agree.""I think it's very obvious we're taking share from everyone in the space,"" McLaughlin said.William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho sees Palo Alto Networks as on track to become the largest pure-play cybersecurity company. Currently, Check Point and Symantec (SYMC) have a narrow lead with $14.8 billion and $12.7 billion market values, respectively, to Palo Alto Networks' $12.6 billion.Blair maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.""Palo Alto continues to gain market share behind what we believe is flawless execution,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote in a report. Nowinski retained his overweight rating and 208 price target on Palo Alto Networks.The company's platform vision is beginning to bear fruit, Zeller wrote.""Platform (is) an overused term, but it's key to why we hear Palo Alto continues to grow 60%-plus (in billings) as others decelerate,"" he wrote. ""In an environment where there was much anxiousness about buying the point-solution of the moment, Palo Alto has crafted a position as the 'go-to' broad purchase for re-architecting security.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

368,SYMC,"Tech giant IBM (IBM) is solidifying its cybersecurity standing by deepening ties to No. 1 pure player Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) to pool research and integrate systems, the companies were scheduled to announce Thursday.It's the most recent in a series of IBM moves to publicly step-up its cybersecurity initiatives. In 2015, IBM drew in $2 billion in cybersecurity sales, just 2.4% of total revenue.But that dollar mark easily topped total sales for Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE), and 12% year-over-year growth outstripped that of Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point.By combining forces, IBM and Check Point aim to thwart what the United Nations estimates is the $445 billion cybercrime underworld. Check Point's and IBM Security's researchers will be free to cross company borders to discuss threat data.And several Check Point applications will be folded into IBM technology, Check Point's vice president of security services, Avi Rembaum, told IBD. The alliance redoubles an 18-year relationship between IBM and Check Point.IBM manages security offerings for clients across the globe, and those implementations sometimes include Check Point products. The two companies have partnered in that regard for the past 18 years. Thus, IBM is keenly apprised of Check Point's software. Under the new accord, Check Point will further school IBM on its tech.""Tightening the relationship means we'll be giving IBM very deep guidance around exactly what fields they should be looking for and how systems integrate,"" Rembaum said.The new alliance centers on four main keys.Check Point and IBM will combine research forces to create ""a gigantic pool of security researchers,"" Rembaum said. Doing so will expand the potential threat intelligence-gathering net, but also lend credibility to potential discoveries.""When we conduct research, it's nice to have another leading organization with which we can provide notes,"" he said. ""It's helpful to have a pool of researchers to validate assumptions. . . . When two sources say it's true, it makes it more relevant and more critical.""But what's more compelling is the integrated threat-prevention and analytics technologies, Rembaum says.Check Point will fold its SmartConsole application into the IBM Security App Exchange for integration with IBM's Security QRadar Intelligence Platform. Together, the systems can tackle the entire security gamut -- analyzing, blocking and mitigating attacks.The integration also means that a customer can operate within an IBM space but still access Check Point functions, Rembaum said.IBM customers will also be allowed to manage Check Point Mobile Threat Prevention within IBM's MaaS360 enterprise-mobility management system, a software used to remove malicious apps and do quick security rollouts. Mobile is ""the most critical space"" for customers to protect, he said.""(Smartphones) are an always-on and always-connected vehicle for employees,"" he said. ""And they operate outside the corporate security perimeter.""The expanded alliance also allows IBM to manage Check Point's entire suite of products for clients, Rembaum said. Check Point will expand the number of tools IBM supports.""So IBM can be there in lockstep with us when we offer services,"" he said.

""In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.""On Feb. 8, a hacker also reportedly obtained records on 20,000 FBI staffers from a Department of Justice computer and threatened to release the information.""The hacker made good on this promise and in fact released the related documents,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD via email. ""These two significant events have helped put cyber concerns back on the front page.""HACK holds 34 stocks. Its three largest holdings -- Symantec Corp.

370,SYMC,"Networking firm Cisco Systems (CSCO) mounted a cybersecurity charge Tuesday, unveiling a next-generation firewall to squash Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee.Protecting digital data is a $19 billion opportunity over the next 10 years, Dave Stuart, Cisco's director of product marketing, told IBD. Cisco's Firepower Next-Generation Firewall will capture some of those billions, he says.""We believe this level of integration is unprecedented in the environment,"" Stuart says. ""Competitors . . . miss that opportunity to correlate information to shrink that time-to-detection rapidly in the market.""Stuart's words are merely the latest barb lobbed against pure players in the cybersecurity battle for market share. Broad-based tech giants IBM (IBM), Cisco, Dell and Microsoft (MSFT) have made hefty investments in recent years to carve out security sales, going up against each other and companies that focus solely on security wares.Cisco stock was up nearly 3% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 26.On Wednesday, Cisco posted fiscal Q2 results, saying its security sales for the quarter ended Jan. 23 rose 11% from the year-earlier quarter, to $462 million. Cisco's overall revenue was flat. For the first half of fiscal 2016, Cisco's security sales rose 9%, to $947 million.Cisco's half-year security revenue already eclipses the total 2015 sales for CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT), FireEye (FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks, and is nearing Fortinet, which reported $1.01 billion in 2015 sales.And security made up just 4% of Cisco's $11.8 billion in total fiscal Q2 revenue.""We clearly have our efforts behind security,"" Stuart said. ""The opportunity is not lost on our adversaries either.""Industrywide, a breach is generally detected within 100 days, Stuart says. He says Cisco's technology shrank that to 17.5 hours, down from 46 hours in the prior quarter. Firepower pulls intelligence from across that technology to detect a breach.As Stuart describes it, upon a breach, the Firepower management center forces the ""stranger-host"" into a contained environment. The process is automated -- it doesn't require ""back-end analysis with humans,"" Stuart said.""We are providing the best of breed on the IPS (intrusion prevention system) side, advanced breach detection on the malware side and leading third-party platforms,"" he said. ""All that goes into a platform that is best of breed and doesn't force that choice between products.""Last year, Cisco acquired security vendor OpenDNS for $635 million, adding to its $2.7 billion Sourcefire acquisition in 2013. Via OpenDNS, Firepower can detect malicious online activity and then ""instruct the URL to batten down,"" Stuart said.""That's the integration we've built into the platform now,"" he said. ""It really does differentiate us.""Firepower's code is a singular code. Adding third-party layers will require joint efforts among security teams to ensure that the new code is up to snuff, Stuart said, adding, ""We're not opening this up for anybody to write their code onto it.""In conjunction with the Firepower announcement, Cisco unveiled its Security Segmentation Service, an advisory service designed to examine a client's data for weaknesses, and then create a customized security approach.But that doesn't mean Cisco is necessarily peddling its segmentation solution, TrustSec, Stuart says. Cisco competes in the segmentation market against pure players like Fortinet and Symantec (SYMC).The advisory service is merely a design jumping point, Stuart said.""We start with a workshop,"" he said. ""After about 60 days we discern what their business and compliance issues are. That goes essentially into building a design for segmentation.""Stuart acknowledges that Cisco is a newer entrant to the cybersecurity market. Switching, routing and collaboration remain its largest chunks of revenue, bringing $3.48 billion, $1.85 billion and $1.02 billion, respectively, in total fiscal Q2 sales. Cisco long has been the No. 1 maker of networking gear.Rivals ""have been in the next-generation firewall space for a while,"" he said. ""I might add, some of the vendors providing sand-boxing are trying to expand their portfolios into prevention and remediation. We're way ahead on them in terms of those aspects.""

371,SYMC,"Defense Secretary Ash Carter is trying to enlist Silicon Valley in its cyberwar, even as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) rally to Apple's (AAPL) defense in its fight against the FBI.Carter will speak at the RSA Conference, an information security-related conference in San Francisco, Wednesday about innovation in cybersecurity and opportunities for the Defense Department and Silicon Valley to work together. NSA Director and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers is also speaking at the conference.The conference comes as the FBI and Apple are turning to Congress to settle a dispute over ""back doors"" that would allow officials, and potentially hackers, to decrypt customer data.Apple opposes a court order that would force it to hack into an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack, citing the 1st Amendment. Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet have said they will file amicus briefs supporting Apple.Shares of Apple closed up 4% Tuesday as its general counsel testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, along with FBI Director James Comey. Microsoft rose 3.3%, Facebook added 2.7%, and Alphabet climbed 3.5%.Cyberwarfare has become a focus in the fight against the Islamic State. At a Pentagon briefing Monday, Carter said forces were employing cyber warfare against ISIS, alongside traditional forces but didn't go into specifics.""At the same time, we're bombing ISIL's banks as well as oil wells they've taken over or coerced others into operating on their behalf,"" Carter said. ""We're also using cyber tools to disrupt ISIL's ability to operate and communicate over the virtual battlefield.""Carter said the cyberattacks were aimed at interrupting the Islamic State's ""ability to command and control forces there, control the population and the economy.""Meanwhile, the Pentagon has requested $7 billion in 2017 and $35 billion over the next five years to build up cyber capabilities.Silicon Valley and government agencies, especially the DOD,  have been at odds for years. Tech companies are especially leery of the Pentagon after Edward Snowden’s leaks over digital surveillance.But Carter has been a strong advocate for cooperation between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley and last year he became the first sitting Pentagon chief in nearly two decades to visit the tech hub. The Pentagon also opened a Defense Innovation Unit- Experimental outreach office in Mountain View, Calif.  last summer.Also appearing at the RSA Conference are executives from Symantec (SYMC), AT&T (T), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft, Cisco (CSCO), VMware (VMW) and Red Hat (RHT).Palo Alto shares rose 2.7%. Cisco shares gained 2.5%. VMware edged up 0.5% and Red Hat shares 4.65%.

372,SYMC,"Sales of $2 billion are a drop in the bucket -- if you’re IBM (IBM) or Cisco Systems (CSCO).That’s how much tech giant IBM drew in 2015 security revenue. Networking giant Cisco pulled in $1.75 billion in security revenue. But security sales accounted for just 2.4% and 3%, respectively, of those companies’ multibillion-dollar top lines.Both IBM and Cisco say their cybersecurity revenue rose 12% last year. The growth outstripped pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP). And the total dollar sales for IBM and Cisco easily topped total revenue for leading security pure players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Cybersecurity Ventures CEO Steve Morgan says it’s just the beginning of a series of “knockdown, dragout brawls"" among tech giants IBM, Cisco, Dell and others specifically in the security software-and-services arena in 2016.And companies like IBM and Cisco don't enter the ring with kid gloves. This bare-knuckle  donnybrook for cybersecurity superiority will be fought with well-padded M&A budgets. The steep decline in security software stocks of late, amid fears of slowing spending on enterprise software, only raises the stakes, making some buyout targets likely more affordable.Lower spending could hit security vendors, but there's no debate that cybersecurity needs have grown. Hackers stormed the digital bulwarks of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Sony (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That drove a lot of what Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski calls “panic spending.”More than 60% of 137 chief information officers recently polled by Piper Jaffray had refreshed their security firewalls within the past 12 months. And firewall security ranked only No. 5 on a list of CIO priorities. Endpoint security, compliance, protecting Web applications, and internal-access management topped CIO priorities.These latter four segments will be hot M&A sectors this year, Nowinski says.“A lot of enterprises, in light of all the mega-breaches that occurred in 2014 and 2015, really beefed up and spent a lot on their network perimeters,” he told IBD. “After getting more comfortable with your perimeter (by beefing up firewalls) . . . you need to invest in technology that protects what the hackers are going after.”Symantec, Trend Micro and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee lead the endpoint protection sector, according to Gartner. The market tracker says Imperva (IMPV) and F5 Networks (FFIV) top the Web-application firewall market, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) leads the internal-access management segment.Valuations skyrocketed in the hyperactive 2015 threat landscape, Nowinski says. Thus, last year wasn't one of big consolidation for cybersecurity.""Companies were trying to figure out what were the most strategic assets they needed to add to protect against the changing threat environment,"" he said. ""The threat environment was evolving very quickly and valuations were going through the roof with these mega-breaches.""Valuations, however, have plunged lately. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down nearly 40% as of Friday from its 2015 high achieved July 24 -- after the group plunged 7.4% on Friday. From the start of 2015 through July 24, the group had rocketed 33%.The group tacked on another 7.2% loss by the closing bell Monday, as techs tumbled on the heels of poorly received forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA), whose stocks sheared off after their quarterly reports last week. Cloud securer Qualys added to the pressure when, late Monday, the firm reported Q4 and 2015 sales that missed consensus views, and issued Q1 guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.The mass high-tech selloff also plagued IBD’s 26-company Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which landed down 4% and 2.8% on Friday and Monday, respectively.Still, a lot of big dollars are up for grabs in cybersecurity, FBR analyst Daniel Ives says. He estimates that spending on next-generation security wares will jump 30% in 2016, though total IT spending is seen rising just 3%.Gartner estimates that IT security spending will soar from $75 billion-plus in 2015 to $101 billion in 2018. Research firm Markets and Markets sees the cybersecurity market hitting $170 billion by 2020.""It's such an enormous growth segment, in a very choppy environment,"" Ives told IBD. ""It's pent-up demand and it's the massive threat environment. . . . You look at the technology landscape and cybersecurity is a priority.""As nontraditional security firms jump on the cybersecurity bandwagon, no potential M&A is off limits, Cybersecurity Ventures' Morgan says.""If you look at the cybersecurity industry, there are not a lot of unicorns,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is (startups) will raise $10 million to $100 million . . . to ratchet up and get acquired by multimillion-dollar tech companies.""In January, FireEye stirred the M&A dust with a $200 million acquisition of cyberthreat intelligence firm iSight Partners, expanding its portfolio again after its $1 billion Mandiant acquisition in 2014.""That's where we're going to see the market,"" Morgan said. ""Any company that has successfully raised (venture capital) funding would be a takeover candidate.""Alan Kessler, CEO of privately held Vormetric, calls these ""tuck-in acquisitions.""""I think the pace of acquisitions is probably going to accelerate simply because of what's happening in the overall market demand for solutions,"" Kessler told IBD, ""but also the fact that some of the smaller players may have difficulty getting funding at a valuation that is appealing to their investors.""Vormetric falls into that ""tuck-in"" field. The encryption specialist is in the process of being acquired by Thales, a French company focused on ""creating a safer world,"" according to its website.Thales isn't a pure cybersecurity player but it touches 80% of online-processing payments, Kessler says. Vormetric will be threaded into Thales' data security group when the transaction closes, likely in late March.Kessler expects IBM and Cisco to continue adding new cybersecurity offerings to their portfolios. And the market recognizes that -- big tech firms know enterprise-level software, Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik told IBD.""There's consolidation in the customers, the enterprise; they want to buy fewer tools from fewer vendors,"" Oltsik said. ""They want an integrated platform because what we've done in the past isn't working anymore.""And the efficiency of the technology has to be enterprise class, so that kind of speaks to the bigger vendors who know how to service the enterprise.""In the largest pure-tech merger ever, Dell last year agreed to acquire EMC for $67 billion in -- and thereby got its hands on EMC's RSA security business. In December, Dell confirmed rumors that it filed a $2 billion IPO for its SecureWorks business, which it acquired in 2011 for $612 million.""They single out cybersecurity and decide that's their spinoff?"" Morgan said. ""That says a lot about the market.""The pure players have done some tucking of their own. In 2015, Fortinet acquired Meru Networks for $44 million and Check Point spent $80 million on Lacoon Mobile Security.Also in 2015, Cisco followed up its $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013 by acquiring OpenDNS for $635 million. And Raytheon acquired Websense for $1.9 billion, to create privately held Forcepoint.Between 2014 and 2015, Microsoft (MSFT) -- which Oltsik calls a cybersecurity ""wild card"" -- spent $600 million to buy three Israeli cybersecurity firms.""You would not call Microsoft a cybersecurity company,"" Morgan says. ""But you're starting to see them get very active in cyber. IBM would be another interesting company.""In 2015, IBM's total sales fell 12%, to $81.7 billion, even as its cybersecurity sales rose 12% to $2 billion.""That's a lot (of growth) when you're counting in the billions,"" Morgan said. ""That's not on a lot of people's radar. That gets lost a little bit in the context of much bigger companies.""FireEye's iSight acquisition is the only confirmed M&A in the sector this year. But CyberArk stock surged in January on rumors that Check Point is seeking to acquire it. Culturally, it makes sense --  they're both Israeli firms, Ives says.Should Check Point and CyberArk merge, such a deal would be larger than a tuck-in, Morgan says. Although Check Point is much larger -- with a $13.5 billion market value to CyberArk's $1.3 billion -- both are credible performers, he said.""I'm not sure we'd call that a merger or an acquisition,"" he said. ""CyberArk and Check Point, if that were to happen, I think you're looking at two companies coming together and looking to move into a much larger position in the market.""Cisco, Oracle (ORCL), IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec will stoke 2016 M&A, Ives says. He lists Qualys (QLYS), CyberArk, Fortinet, FireEye and Imperva on his takeover list. He says the timing is especially ripe for Symantec to make an acquisition.Symantec completed its Veritas sale to the Carlyle Group on Jan. 29,  saying it received $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the deal. Symantec acquired data storage firm Veritas for $13.5 billion in 2005, a deal that many analysts questioned.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec struggled in 2015, when revenue fell 2.4% to $6.54 billion. Now, Symantec will apply the cash from the Veritas sale toward an acquisition that strengthens its position, Nowinski said.Oltsik sees platform plays taking out Resilient Systems, Phantom Cyber, Invotas or ServiceNow (NOW) as automation becomes an increasingly important piece of cybersecurity. Smaller firms like Malwarebytes and Code DX also could be swept into the M&A frenzy, Morgan says.""In a different tech sector, where there's not as much M&A activity, you have to be doing some very cutting-edge things to be an acquisition target,"" he said. ""Here, if you walk and talk and raise money in the cybersecurity space, you're a target.""

375,SYMC,"Cybersecurity stocks zoomed higher Friday on Fortinet's (FTNT) back after the firm, late Thursday, topped Wall Street's Q4 billings views and announced a restructuring amid stalling growth.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group rocketed 5.2% in early trading on the stock market today before settling to a gain of 1.8% in the afternoon. The group, though, is down 16% year to date.Shares of CyberArk Software (CYBR), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet led the way up Friday, rising 9.3%, 7% and 6.8%, respectively. Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) stock rose 2.6% on its own late-Thursday Q4 sales and earnings beat.But Proofpoint (PFPT) stock plunged 6.5% Friday, a day after the company beat Q4 sales views but reported that losses were expected to deepen in Q1.At least two analysts cut their price targets on Proofpoint stock Friday. Fortinet stock suffered at least one downgrade and two price target cuts.Fortinet delivered a ""billings beat that will be front and center this morning,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research report.For its Q4 ended Dec. 31, Fortinet reported $380.9 million in billings, up 35% year over year. The figure topped analysts expectations for $367.5 million and the company's three-months-ago guidance for between $364 million and $369 million, Ives wrote.Billings for 2015 were $1.2 billion, up 37%.Fortinet also reported 18 cents earnings per share ex items on $296.5 million in Q4 sales, up 21% and 32%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Sales narrowly topped the consensus of 30 analysts for $296.2 million, and EPS met the model. Both measures were in line with Fortinet's guidance three months earlier for $293 million-$298 million and 18-19 cents.Fortinet wrapped 2015 with $1.01 billion in sales and 51 cents EPS ex items, exactly meeting Wall Street forecasts and in line with the company's earlier outlook.Current-quarter guidance for $270 million to $275 million in sales and 8-9 cents EPS ex items lagged the consensus for $277.7 million and 12 cents. Sales would be up 28% at the midpoint, but EPS would be flat to down 12.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The company expects Q1 billings of $315 million to $322 million, up 25% year over year at the midpoint of guidance. For 2016, Fortinet expects $1.5 billion to $1.52 billion in billings, a 23% year-over-year jump at the midpoint.Fortinet also announced a strategic restructuring within its U.S. enterprise sales force to focus on the midmarket and global enterprises ""following another quarter of disappointing growth,"" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho wrote in a report. Ho maintained his outperform rating on Fortinet stock.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski noted Q4 was the first in 11 straight quarters in which Fortinet failed to exceed the high end of guidance. Product revenue of $144.8 million trailed the consensus for $147.1 million and ""was the primary culprit,"" he wrote in a report.Nowinski reiterated his neutral rating and 30 price target on Fortinet stock.But subscription revenue of $151.8 million outgrew product revenue -- 34% year over year to 30.8% year over year -- and led Fortinet to a 73.1% gross margin in Q4 vs. consensus views for 71.6%, Nowinski wrote.During Q4, Fortinet signed 577 deals worth more than $100,000, 193 deals worth more than $250,000, and 74 deals for more than $500,000 -- vs. 384, 137 and 60 deals, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter, Ives wrote.""We believe this trend will continue into 2016, as Fortinet has a nice window of opportunity to move into larger enterprises,"" he wrote.Ives retained his outperform rating on Fortinet stock but cut his price target to 38 from 44.Analysts and investors split Friday on Proofpoint stock. Wall Street applauded Proofpoint's Q4 sales beat, but investors pulled out in droves after Q1 guidance showed losses deepening by 3-4 cents per share.Proofpoint stock sank by as much as 11.5% in Friday trading, touching a year-low.For its fiscal Q4 ended Dec. 31, Proofpoint reported $74.9 million in sales, up 33% year over year, and an 11-cent loss per share, deepening from a 9-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Billings of $97.5 million exceeded the consensus for $92.7 million, Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow wrote in a report.Sales narrowly topped the consensus view for $73.46 million, as well as Proofpoint's guidance three months ago for $72.5 million to $73.5 million. The 11-cent loss per share was in line with expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and Proofpoint's prediction of a loss per share of 11-12 cents.The year wrapped with a 36% year-over-year sales jump to $265.4 million and a 35 cents loss per share vs. a 40-cent loss in 2014. Analysts were expecting $264 million and a 35-cent loss per share vs. Proofpoint's guide to $263 million to $264 million and 35-36 cents.But the Q1 guide disappointed.For the current quarter, Proofpoint sees $75.5 million to $76.5 million in sales, up 32% at the midpoint of guidance, and a loss per share of 14-15 cents. The consensus expected a 9-cent loss, which would have been flat year over year, while sales were merely in line.Proofpoint upped its 2016 revenue and billings outlook to $345 million to $348 million, and $428 million to $431 million, respectively.The guidance doesn't take into account recent partnerships with Intel's (INTC) McAfee and Palo Alto Networks, Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wrote in a separate report. Both ventures involve threat-intelligence sharing and joint go-to-market strategies, and ""could drive upside to estimates.""Nowinski reiterated his overweight rating and 76 price target on Proofpoint stock.Winslow maintained his overweight rating on Proofpoint stock and called it ""one of our favorite small-cap ideas in our coverage."" Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury dubbed it ""the one to own"" and reiterated a buy rating and 80 price target.During Q4, Proofpoint's TAP (targeted area protection) product grew 100% year over year for the ninth consecutive quarter, Winslow wrote. Proofpoint also sees serious upsell and cross-sell opportunities, noting 44% of all customers use two or more products.Nandury expects Proofpoint to dig into its Fortune 100 and Fortune 1000 customers to gain market share over incumbents like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Symantec (SYMC), Microsoft (MSFT), McAfee and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Check Point notched a 5-cent EPS ex-items beat for its Q4 ended Dec. 31, but the midpoints of its Q1 guidance fell short of Wall Street views.For its Q4, Check Point reported $458 million in sales and $1.20 EPS ex items, up 9% and 12% year over year, respectively. Both topped the consensus model for $457.1 million and $1.15.Three months ago, Check Point guided to $440 million to $470 million in sales and $1.10 to $1.18 EPS minus items.Check Point wrapped the year with $1.63 billion in sales and $4.17 EPS minus items. Sales were in line with the consensus view, but EPS topped Wall Street expectations by 4 cents, and Check Point beat the high-end of its own EPS guidance by 1 cent.For the current quarter, Check Point sees $395 million to $410 million in sales and 99 cents to $1.05 EPS minus items. On a year-over-year basis, that would be down 8% and 7%, respectively, at the midpoints of guidance.Wall Street projected $404.8 million and $1.04.Regardless of the soft view, William Blair's Ho reiterated his outperform rating on Check Point stock noting the company saw strong data center and subscription growth in Q4.And Check Point is bracing for competition, he wrote.""Our discussions with re-sellers and partners suggest Check Point has been much more aggressive in courting the channel and in trying to match pricing on deals than it has been historically,"" he wrote.It's also possible Check Point could mount up through an acquisition. On Thursday, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed didn't dismiss the question during the conference call.""We are looking at the entire spectrum,"" he told investors.

376,SYMC,"Headline breaches drove 2015 cybersecurity spending, but the several-months-long lull in hacks won't slug CyberArk Software (CYBR), company CEO Udi Mokady told IBD Friday, as shares sank after the company gave disappointing Q1 and 2016 earnings guidance late Thursday.CyberArk stock pitched to a 16-month low, toppling as much as 14% Friday. Shares were down 11%, near 32.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Shares of fellow security vendor FireEye (FEYE), which also gave disappointing guidance, were down 5% Friday afternoon, touching an all-time low.But unlike Tableau Software's (DATA) grim 2016 outlook last week, CyberArk's and FireEye's guidance misses didn't spiral into a widespread security deluge. IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security was down a small fraction Friday afternoon.The group had soared 29% in the first seven months of 2015 on the heels of the Ashley Maddison, Anthem (ANTM) and U.S. Office of Personnel Management breaches. Thereafter, lacking high-profile breaches, the group plunged 40.5% in five months.CyberArk stock, too, was tugged down 38% in the back-half of 2015. But, Mokady says, while panic does play into stock prices, it doesn't touch CyberArk's sales.""Some vendors ... are more driven by emergency spending and you need to be breached in order to dial their number,"" he said. ""We're not seeing a change in demand. But we're also a very prudent company.""Analysts are banking on that prudence. At least five analysts cut their price targets on CyberArk stock Friday, but at least three said the firm's guidance was conservative.For Q4, CyberArk reported 39 cents earnings per share ex items on $51.5 million in sales, up 86% and 42%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter, and topping the consensus model for 20 cents and $43.9 million.License revenue of $33 million accounted for 64% of revenue, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote in a research report. Nowinski cut his price target on CyberArk stock to 55 from 67 but reiterated his overweight rating.""Demand remains very strong, highlighted by a book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1,"" he wrote. ""They even had some larger deals with oil/gas companies, despite increasing macroeconomic pressure on that sector.""For Q1, CyberArk sees $42.5 million to $43.5 million in sales, topping the consensus for $41.6 million, and up 30% at the midpoint. But the EPS ex items view for 15-16 cents trailed analyst expectations for 17 cents, and would be flat to down 6%.CyberArk guided to $205 million to $207 million in 2016 sales, up 27% at the midpoint and above expectations for $202.3 million. But the EPS view for 83-86 cents would be down 15.5% at the midpoint and missed the consensus model for 91 cents.Mokady said he doesn't ""call that a miss.""""We provided guidance we believe in, and I guess the consensus was different,"" he told IBD. ""We think the prudent strategy is for us to invest. ... That's been guiding us as we planned our 2016.""The lull between attacks drew cybersecurity stocks down, PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. Chanin runs the HACK (HACK) ETF which includes CyberArk, FireEye, Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Fortinet (FTNT). Symantec (SYMC) stock leads the Top 10.HACK stock was flat Friday afternoon, hurt by CyberArk's plunge.""That sharp move down today caught me by surprise,"" Chanin said, noting CyberArk's Q4 metrics were largely within expectations. ""Investors that got into the space over the past year are probably licking some of their wounds right now, because it has been a very volatile ride.""I don't think we've had a catastrophic attack yet. That could be the next major catalyst for the industry. ... Investing is partially emotional.""During last year's 30-day Cyber Sprint, the federal government acknowledged its shortcomings in privileged account management, CyberArk's bread-and-butter, Mokady said. Now, credential protection is almost ""the basic action.""That spotlight should benefit CyberArk, Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury wrote in a report. Nandury cut his price target on CyberArk stock to 30 from 47 but maintained his hold rating.Nowinski, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho and Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick noted CyberArk's conservative guidance. Dougherty expects to see ""several quarters of beat and raises in 2016.""Wall Street offered FireEye stock a caveat Friday as at least five analysts cut their price targets: The company's transition to a platform service is well underway.For Q4, FireEye reported $184.8 million in sales, up 29%, and a per-share loss of 36 cents, better by a penny vs. the year-earlier loss. Billings of $257 million jumped 21%.Sales were just shy of the consensus model for $185.3 million. Analysts had modeled a per-share loss of 37 cents. And Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens noted FireEye posted ""massive deceleration in billings and revenue.""But Owens rates FireEye stock overweight.FireEye's 2015 sales jumped 46% year over year to $623 million, a hair short of the consensus model for $623.4 million. But its per-share loss of $1.30 was 67 cents better than the 2014 metric and beat Wall Street views for $1.62. Billings of $797 million grew 35% year over year.Current-quarter sales guidance for $167 million to $177 million, up 37% at the midpoint, was at the low end of analyst expectations for $167.9 million. And FireEye's per-share loss outlook for 49-53 cents missed Wall Street's model for 40 cents.For Q1, the company expects $163 million to $183 million in billings, up 14% at the midpoint.FireEye's subscription-as-a-service and product platform expansion ""could position the company to be a premier facilitator of organizations' broad cybersecurity needs,"" William Blair's Ho wrote in a report.The transition would put FireEye in rivalry with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), another platform peddler. But the shift in demand is a concern, Owens wrote.""We believe FireEye is executing well on becoming a platform play, but the sudden demand shift from physical appliances to cloud-based offerings creates near-term risk,"" he wrote.During Q4, product revenue declined 2%, but subscription revenue jumped 57.5%. International sales grew 70%, helping FireEye recover from a Q3 belly flop that caused shares to dive in November.Further into 2016, Ho expects FireEye to balance its investments amid the slowing ""reactionary spending"" environment.

Investors worldwide cringed as China's stock markets stalled and then sold off in droves.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group plunged more than 3.5%. Only FireEye, along with smaller stocks Identiv (INVE) and Ability (ABIL), survived the fall.No. 1 by IBD Composite Rating and market value in the group, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was down nearly 4%. Shares of fellow heavyweights Fortinet (FTNT), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) were down between 3% and 4% each.European Sales CrashFireEye stock crashed 23% in November after the company reported Q3 revenue and guided to Q4 sales that missed Wall Street projections. During Q3, FireEye lost its vice president of federal sales to Palo Alto Networks and a marketing executive to Fortinet.As a result, sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment declined sequentially for the third consecutive quarter and showed slowing year-over-year growth.Now, Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury says that FireEye stock has depreciated to an attractive buy-in point. He rates FireEye stock a buy and initiated his coverage with a 35 price target.Other analysts are bearish on FireEye stock, he notes. But ""FireEye is cheap, despite having growth of 28%, vs. the peer average of 25%.""""While it is entirely possible that the company can provide 2016 revenue/billings outlook that is below consensus, we believe the pullback of shares from current levels is limited,"" he wrote in a research report.FireEye gets a very low IBD Composite Rating: 18 out of a possible 99.Cybersecurity Market GrowthNetwork sandboxing, FireEye's bread and butter, had a $600 million total addressable market (TAM) in 2014 and is expected to have a 24% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2017, Nandury wrote.FireEye's newer segments — intrusion detection/prevention, corporate endpoint and threat intelligence security, threat analytics and security information event management — have a combined TAM of about $9 billion, Nandury estimated.""In total, the TAM for FireEye is growing at 25% CAGR through at least 2018, providing the company with significant growth opportunity,"" he wrote. He expects FireEye to have ""years of high growth"" in the mid-20% range.Nandury also expects FireEye to catch more Fortune 2000 customers. Currently, FireEye serves 50% of the Fortune 500 and 35% of the Fortune 2000.""Given that FireEye is known to catch malware other vendors missed, we expect many of the Fortune 2000 companies to deploy FireEye's solutions eventually,"" he wrote.'A Very Attractive Potential Acquisition'Plus, FireEye ""could make a very attractive potential acquisition,"" Nandury wrote, noting that the company leads its universe in interception and remediation of advanced persistent threats (APTs).""We believe the cybersecurity industry is a consolidating industry,"" he added. ""Given that FireEye has one of the best technologies to defend against APTs, we believe it could be an attractive acquisition candidate for a variety of players in the industry.""Nandury lists Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Symantec and Intel as likely acquisitive companies eyeballing FireEye.Between June 2006 and January 2014, 11 cybersecurity-oriented deals closed, Nandury wrote. Most of them are back-end heavy with six deals between 2011 and 2014.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

440,SYMC,"FireEye was dealing with a tough comparison quarter, CFO Michael Berry told analysts during the conference call. In Q3 2014, FireEye signed a five-year, eight-figure deal with a federal agency. No such deal emerged in Q3 2015. The company's average contract length slipped to 30 months from 34 months in the year-earlier quarter.
"
441,SYMC,"FireEye was specifically hurt by depressed European sales on the strengthened U.S. dollar.
"
442,SYMC,"On a nine-month basis, federal sales are great, CEO David DeWalt told analysts on the call.
"
443,SYMC,"""The federal sales model has been a shining star for the company,"" he said. ""(But) when you look at Q3, maybe (we're) not quite where we had hoped to be.""
"
444,SYMC,"FireEye representatives didn't return a request from IBD for comment by press time.
"
445,SYMC,"During Q3, Palo Alto Networks swiped FireEye's head of federal sales, Nick Urick. FireEye hired David Ramirez of L-3 National Security Solutions to take Urick's post.
"
446,SYMC,"""You can see the writing on the wall here, where Palo Alto Networks just hired away the head of FireEye's federal sales team,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski told IBD. ""They're building up their sales representatives, and we're starting to see a lot of security vendors trying to move into that space.""
"
447,SYMC,"Rogue Credentials
"
448,SYMC,"The recent onslaught of attacks buoyed other companies.
"
449,SYMC,"For its Q3, Israel-based CyberArk reported sales and earnings that trounced Wall Street's expectations, assisted by 10 new contracts within the federal executive and legislative branches, CEO Udi Mokady told analysts during the conference call.
"
450,SYMC,"The federal government's Sept. 30 fiscal year-end typically means bolstered fall-quarter sales for companies like CyberArk.
"
451,SYMC,"But it was the OPM breach and the government 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint initiative that really increased awareness, Mokady said. U.S. Chief Information Officer Tony Scott launched the Sprint in June, forcing federal agencies to examine and better their cybersecurity practices.
"
452,SYMC,"Privileged-account policies, CyberArk's specialty, was No. 3 on the list of issues that federal agencies had to address.
"
453,SYMC,"A privileged account has administrative access to a computer system. On average, every organization — the federal government included — has three to four times the number of privileged accounts as employees, CyberArk Chief Marketing Officer John Worrall told IBD.
"
454,SYMC,"To put that number in perspective, ""One bank told us they stopped counting at 1 million,"" he said.
"
455,SYMC,"The motivation to protect those accounts is clear. But attackers can be nimbler than the enterprises that they target.
"
456,SYMC,"""One of the biggest challenges organizations face is the attackers can often be more agile than the organizations,"" he said. ""(CyberArk software) adds the ability to detect anomalous behavior ... that helps level the playing field.""
"
457,SYMC,"From a federal government perspective, CyberArk must protect rogues from getting in and insiders from going rogue, Worrall said. He cited Edward Snowden's release of thousands of National Security Agency documents as an example of the latter.
"
458,SYMC,"To the former point, he said: ""Once the outsider comes in, he's going to steal the credentials of an insider, and at that point, honestly, you won't know the difference.""
"
459,SYMC,"Risk Aversion Runs Deep
"
460,SYMC,"Cybersecurity firms are hesitant to break out specific numbers.
"
461,SYMC,"Neither CyberArk nor Palo Alto Networks would delve deeper into the percentages of total revenue that federal sales comprise. Last month, Fortinet said that it received 12% of its Q3 sales from the government sector — but that figure includes international revenue as well.
"
462,SYMC,"During Symantec's Q3 earnings call this month, CEO Thomas Seifert would say only that Symantec's U.S. federal business ""did very well."" Last month, Qualys CEO Philippe Courtot told analysts that a tiny 1% of the company's sales in Q3 derived from federal contracts.
"
463,SYMC,"""So, as you can see, it's probably negligible,"" he said.
"
464,SYMC,"All taken, there's still a lot of room for growth, Palo Alto Networks' Vice President of Government Affairs and Policy Ryan Gillis told IBD.
"
465,SYMC,"The federal government lags the enterprise and private sectors in terms of next-generation technology adoption, he said. Procurement processes are slower, and certification processes often snag quick adoption.
"
466,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks allows potential customers to trial its software, Gillis said. Between 80% and 90% of trial runners evolve into customers. But risk aversion within the government runs strong, and federal players generally spurn Palo Alto's offer.
"
467,SYMC,"""It's not an environment conducive to upgrading to the newest and greatest,"" he said. ""It stems from understandable places but disadvantages the network in some cases.""
"
468,SYMC,"That being said, the federal government realizes its precarious position as an international target, and some early adopters within the government have made mass headway into cybersecurity initiatives, Gillis said.
"
469,SYMC,"""The government certainly is a recipient of a range of attacks from run of the mill to very sophisticated stuff,"" he said. ""You certainly get some demanding customers in the government that recognize the nature of the threats.""

470,SYMC,"Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.There's $14 billion up for grabs in fiscal 2016 cybersecurity spending by the sector's biggest customer — the federal government — and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), FireEye (FEYE), Fortinet (FTNT) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) are vying for their respective chunks of cash.But some are doing better than others.FireEye stock plunged to a record low 21.75 on Nov. 5 after reporting Q3 sales that missed Wall Street views and guiding below consensus expectations. The resulting 23% sell-off drew CyberArk stock into the fray.CyberArk, which beat-and-raised on its Q3, dropped 4% after a stellar quarterly report that included 10 new federal customers within the executive and legislative branches. Since then, both companies have suffered continued losses on Wall Street.Despite their opposite-ends-of-the-spectrum reports, both companies acknowledge that federal spending on cybersecurity is ramping up as headline-making breaches drive awareness across all spheres.In the latest big case, the Justice Department announced charges Nov. 10 against three men for what it termed ""massive computer hacking crimes against U.S. financial institutions, brokerage firms and financial news publishers."" The financial sector hacks involved stealing the personal information of over 100 million customers, and a maze of other cyberattacks are said to amount to one of the largest thefts of financial-related data in history.Attacks SkyrocketBetween fiscal years 2006 and 2014, cyberattacks on federal agencies increased nearly 12 times over, from 5,503 to 67,168, according to a recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.Federal spending isn't keeping up.Between 2014 and 2016, federal cybersecurity spending grew 40% — compared with the 1,100% increase in attacks over the past eight years. The GAO report didn't provide figures for attacks occurring in individual years.Inarguably, though, the biggest attacks occurred on the back end of that eight-year period.In May, hackers accessed about 334,000 taxpayer accounts.A month later, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach resulted in the release of 21.5 million employee records.More recently, in October, the U.S. Postal Service was targeted. The scope of that hack is still under investigation.In November, U.S. officials suggested that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was responsible for a recent surge in cyberattacks against American government employees, the Wall Street Journal reported.The Obama Administration has been hyperfocused on cybersecurity protections, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Earlier this fall, China and the U.S. appeared poised to sign a peace treaty centered on cybersecurity.It's a small step, Ives said.""But ultimately, it's still a game of high-stakes poker, and there's still a high threat level in terms of cyberespionage,"" he said. ""I think that's why the U.S. government can't just sit there and hope it's going to go away, because these threats are as pervasive and sophisticated as we'll ever see.""'The Writing On The Wall'So where does that leave cybersecurity companies?Potentially with a huge sales runway, Ives says.""There's a limited pool of companies that can handle this type of work,"" he said.Ives sees FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, Imperva (IMPV), Fortinet, Symantec (SYMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) taking huge chunks of the federal cybersecurity spending market. Ives estimates the market opportunity at $20 billion over the next three years.The ""rip-and-replace"" age of legacy cybersecurity systems is still in its infancy, Ives said, and it's going to drive deal sizes to unforeseen numbers.Perhaps the perfect cautionary tale, however, is FireEye — which recently plunged on disappointing sales and a week Q4 outlook.FireEye was dealing with a tough comparison quarter, CFO Michael Berry told analysts during the conference call.

473,SYMC,"Better-than-expected results couldn't help Red Hat (RHT) stock Tuesday, with shares of the enterprise software company succumbing to concerns over billing as well as a sharp market downturn.
"
474,SYMC,"Red Hat shares were trading down almost 2% to near 72 in the stock market today, virtually wiping out gains from the prior day. Investors had bid up shares Monday ahead of the after-hours earnings report.
"
475,SYMC,"Some analysts attributed the losses to the market's general downturn. The Nasdaq was down about 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell more than 1.5% as they approached midday trading.
"
476,SYMC,"But it wasn't just that, some said, as Red Hat also disappointed with its billing numbers. Oppenheimer's Brian Schwartz noted that although currency changes affected valuations by 8%, billing growth of 9% still fell short of expectations.
"
477,SYMC,"""Billings (at) 9% is not enough to excite investors and it is the slowest growth for them in eight quarters with tougher year-to-year billings comparisons lying ahead,"" Schwartz said.
"
478,SYMC,"On Monday, Red Hat reported second-quarter earnings of 47 cents a share, up 15% from a year ago and 3 cents ahead of forecasts from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 13% to $504 million, ahead of views for $494.7 million.
"
479,SYMC,"The maker of open-source Linux operating systems also predicted full-year earnings and revenue that were ahead of estimates. Red Hat expects fiscal 2016 earnings of $1.85 to $1.87 a share, up from the $1.83 forecast and 12% ahead of 2015 at the midpoint. Sales are also expected to reach $2.03 billion to $2.04 billion, slightly ahead of views and up 14% from 2015 at the midpoint.

"
487,SYMC,"This year alone, hackers gained access to millions of personal records, including Social Security numbers from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and other personal data from Anthem (ANTM), one of the nation's largest health insurers. More than 30 million e-mail addresses were infamously stolen from extramarital-affairs website Ashley Madison.
"

"
489,SYMC,"And these were just high-profile examples this year. They followed a long list of headline-making breaches, including attacks on Sony Pictures (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD). Untold others suffered breaches outside the spotlight.
"
490,SYMC,"""There will be more,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst with William Blair & Co.
"
491,SYMC,"Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks is one of the fastest growing of all the cybermilitia forces and claims to be the fastest growing in next-generation network firewall security.
"
492,SYMC,"It launched its first next-generation network firewall security product in 2007 and has since expanded to encompass advanced threats, endpoints and the cloud. Meanwhile, it keeps enhancing existing products and rolling out new ones.
"
493,SYMC,"Palo Alto competes with established names in network security such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software (CHKP), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Fortinet (FTNT).
"
494,SYMC,"Disrupting The Legacy Players
"
495,SYMC,"""We were a disruptive company,"" said Palo Alto Chief Marketing Officer Rene Bonvanie in an interview with IBD. Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""
"
496,SYMC,"Palo Alto's next-generation firewall platform is still core to the company's mission: to make it safe for people working in private or public enterprises to use any application from any kind of device.
"
497,SYMC,"The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.
"
498,SYMC,"In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.
"
499,SYMC,"The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.
"
500,SYMC,"Next-generation firewall solutions have more and better defenses, including analytics, intrusion prevention and anti-malware to thwart ""lots of different bad things that affect your computer,"" he said.
"
501,SYMC,"Legacy players are adapting, but it takes longer for big companies to change course than small ones. Meanwhile, Palo Alto is ""rapidly catching up"" to the leaders in network security, Cisco and Check Point, Bonvanie says.
"
502,SYMC,"""We are now the third-largest player in the enterprise security market after Cisco and Check Point,"" he said, adding that his firm's share is around 9%.
"
503,SYMC,"Palo Alto has been growing revenue more than 50% on average the last two years. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in July, revenue jumped 59% to $283.9 million, billings 69% to $393.6 million — both well above analysts' estimates.
"
504,SYMC,"Excluding items, it earned 28 cents per share in Q4, 3 cents above views, up from 11 cents last year.
"
505,SYMC,"Revenue is expected to slow some from a robust 50%-plus rate, but it's still seen growing in strong double-digit percentages. Palo Alto expects revenue to increase 46%- 48% in the current Q1, ending in October, to $280 million-$284 million. Analysts expect revenue for full fiscal 2016, ending next July, to increase 39% to $1.29 billion.

"
507,SYMC,"Investors Are Beneficiaries
"
508,SYMC,"Shares have climbed about 49% this year and are up 336% since the company went public in July 2012.
"
509,SYMC,"Firewall solutions still make up ""(the) vast majority of our business,"" Bonvanie says.
"
510,SYMC,"Ho says that Check Point has lost ""the least (market) share,"" while Fortinet is still early in next-generation firewall products.
"
511,SYMC,"Cisco started stemming market-share losses starting late last year as it integrated products from its acquisition SourceFire in late 2013, according to Nomura Securities analyst Frederick Grieb.
"
512,SYMC,"Based on a recently published Nomura survey of 30 security professionals asked about their buying plans for this year and next, Palo Alto and rival FireEye (FEYE) could be expected to gain the most in spending dollars.
"
513,SYMC,"The survey indicated that the No. 1 priority for security spending this year is for advanced persistent threat protection, which plays into Palo Alto's WildFire product. WildFire's customer base increased 140% by the fourth quarter vs. a year ago to more than 7,000.
"
514,SYMC,"Endpoint protection — whether for a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, cash register, ATM or other computerized hardware — was the second priority. Target, for example, was attacked at the endpoint — through its cash registers.
"
515,SYMC,"Palo Alto's even newer Traps product, which addresses endpoint security, ended the last quarter with 150 customers.
"
516,SYMC,"FireEye competes with Palo Alto in both advanced persistent threat protection and endpoint security.
"
517,SYMC,"Wild West Exotic Tech
"
518,SYMC,"Endpoint security ""has become the Wild West of security,"" attracting startups with ""exotic technology,"" said Palo Alto's Bonvanie. ""Everybody has figured out that the original products are not very useful.""
"
519,SYMC,"Palo Alto's large installed base of customers using its firewall products ""gives us a competitive advantage over the smaller guys"" in endpoint security, he said.
"
520,SYMC,"Other endpoint security players include privately held Bit9 + Carbon Black, Invincea and Bromium.
"
521,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) and McAfee dominate endpoint security. Nomura's survey of security professionals was ""generally negative"" for Symantec, Grieb noted in the survey report, ""with customer perception of the company and its road map continuing to deteriorate over the past 12 months.""
"
522,SYMC,"Similar Endpoint Opportunities
"
523,SYMC,"Said Ho: ""Palo Alto is the main beneficiary of the next-generation transition on the firewall side, and we think they could have similar opportunities in the next-generation endpoint side.""
"
524,SYMC,"Nomura's survey suggested that IT security spending will grow 14% this year and 17% next year.
"
525,SYMC,"In a recent research note, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said that Palo Alto's platform ""is increasingly resonating with customers"" and that demand for its products ""remains robust.""Big-box retailers, investment banks, health insurers, governments, universities: No enterprise seems immune from cyberattacks.

Untold others suffered breaches outside the spotlight.""There will be more,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst with William Blair & Co.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks is one of the fastest growing of all the cybermilitia forces and claims to be the fastest growing in next-generation network firewall security.It launched its first next-generation network firewall security product in 2007 and has since expanded to encompass advanced threats, endpoints and the cloud. Meanwhile, it keeps enhancing existing products and rolling out new ones.Palo Alto competes with established names in network security such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software (CHKP), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Fortinet (FTNT).Disrupting The Legacy Players""We were a disruptive company,"" said Palo Alto Chief Marketing Officer Rene Bonvanie in an interview with IBD. Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""Palo Alto's next-generation firewall platform is still core to the company's mission: to make it safe for people working in private or public enterprises to use any application from any kind of device.The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.Next-generation firewall solutions have more and better defenses, including analytics, intrusion prevention and anti-malware to thwart ""lots of different bad things that affect your computer,"" he said.Legacy players are adapting, but it takes longer for big companies to change course than small ones. Meanwhile, Palo Alto is ""rapidly catching up"" to the leaders in network security, Cisco and Check Point, Bonvanie says.""We are now the third-largest player in the enterprise security market after Cisco and Check Point,"" he said, adding that his firm's share is around 9%.Palo Alto has been growing revenue more than 50% on average the last two years. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in July, revenue jumped 59% to $283.9 million, billings 69% to $393.6 million — both well above analysts' estimates.Excluding items, it earned 28 cents per share in Q4, 3 cents above views, up from 11 cents last year.Revenue is expected to slow some from a robust 50%-plus rate, but it's still seen growing in strong double-digit percentages. Palo Alto expects revenue to increase 46%- 48% in the current Q1, ending in October, to $280 million-$284 million. Analysts expect revenue for full fiscal 2016, ending next July, to increase 39% to $1.29 billion.Earnings for the new year are seen rising 99% to $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.Investors Are BeneficiariesShares have climbed about 49% this year and are up 336% since the company went public in July 2012.Firewall solutions still make up ""(the) vast majority of our business,"" Bonvanie says.Ho says that Check Point has lost ""the least (market) share,"" while Fortinet is still early in next-generation firewall products.Cisco started stemming market-share losses starting late last year as it integrated products from its acquisition SourceFire in late 2013, according to Nomura Securities analyst Frederick Grieb.Based on a recently published Nomura survey of 30 security professionals asked about their buying plans for this year and next, Palo Alto and rival FireEye (FEYE) could be expected to gain the most in spending dollars.The survey indicated that the No. 1 priority for security spending this year is for advanced persistent threat protection, which plays into Palo Alto's WildFire product. WildFire's customer base increased 140% by the fourth quarter vs. a year ago to more than 7,000.Endpoint protection — whether for a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, cash register, ATM or other computerized hardware — was the second priority. Target, for example, was attacked at the endpoint — through its cash registers.Palo Alto's even newer Traps product, which addresses endpoint security, ended the last quarter with 150 customers.FireEye competes with Palo Alto in both advanced persistent threat protection and endpoint security.Wild West Exotic TechEndpoint security ""has become the Wild West of security,"" attracting startups with ""exotic technology,"" said Palo Alto's Bonvanie. ""Everybody has figured out that the original products are not very useful.""Palo Alto's large installed base of customers using its firewall products ""gives us a competitive advantage over the smaller guys"" in endpoint security, he said.Other endpoint security players include privately held Bit9 + Carbon Black, Invincea and Bromium.Symantec (SYMC) and McAfee dominate endpoint security. Nomura's survey of security professionals was ""generally negative"" for Symantec, Grieb noted in the survey report, ""with customer perception of the company and its road map continuing to deteriorate over the past 12 months.""Similar Endpoint OpportunitiesSaid Ho: ""Palo Alto is the main beneficiary of the next-generation transition on the firewall side, and we think they could have similar opportunities in the next-generation endpoint side.""Nomura's survey suggested that IT security spending will grow 14% this year and 17% next year.In a recent research note, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said that Palo Alto's platform ""is increasingly resonating with customers"" and that demand for its products ""remains robust.""

543,SYMC,"A marriage that at the time left many in Silicon Valley scratching their heads will be a thing of the past, as Symantec (SYMC) said Tuesday that it would sell its Veritas data storage business to private equity firm Carlyle Group, valuing the deal at $8 billion.The security software maker's purchase of Veritas in 2004 for more than $13 billion left many on Wall Street wondering about the synergies, as many analysts viewed the two businesses as incompatible, though Symantec stock did hit its all-time high that December, above 34.Last year, Symantec said it would split into two companies, the Symantec and Veritas businesses, but rumors of a possible deal with Carlyle surfaced last month.""While this potential transaction has been discussed in recent media reports, today's news should come as a relief to investors as Symantec finally unloads this 'decade of agita' since the Veritas acquisition was done and now can laser-focus efforts on beefing up its legacy security platform through aggressive M&A with cash from this transaction,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note. ""The Veritas acquisition, in our opinion, remains one of the most head-scratching transactions we have seen in the tech space over the last 15 years and has been a black cloud around the Symantec story, as the company has struggled to reinvigorate its security segment while integrating this square peg in a round hole.""Privately held Carlyle will be joined by GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, in the purchase.

620,SYMC,"Casino resort giant Caesars Entertainment is betting on Vasco Data Security International's multifactor authentication technology to provide an extra layer of security — beyond just username and password — to help prevent hackers from sneaking into its networks.Vasco's (VDSI) recently introduced Cronto authentication and transaction-signing technology is being used by Dutch multinational financial service company Rabobank to improve security, via camera-equipped Rabo Scanner card readers. Vasco's technology provides a graphical cryptogram representing a transaction. When a picture of it is taken and then decoded, customers can securely view financial details on a computer, smartphone or tablet and then authorize the transaction.""Our Cronto technology uses a high-definition color QR (Quick Response) code to deliver a hack-proof method of logging in and signing, which makes the process easier for users by having them perform fewer steps than they do today,"" Vasco CEO T. Kendall Hunt told IBD.In March, Vasco's electronic transaction signing technology was selected by Japanese megabank Mizuho Bank to help protect online banking transactions from hacking attacks.Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Rabobank and Mizuho Bank are among Vasco's 10,000-plus customers in 100 countries.Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.-based Vasco provides authentication and e-signature products and services, specializing in securing online accounts, managing identities and transactions, and protecting assets across financial, enterprise, e-commerce, government and health-care markets.""Much of Vasco's success has been in the online banking vertical, and many banks are upgrading to their next-generation multi-factor authentication and e-signature products,"" said Dougherty & Co. analyst Joseph Maxa.""In addition, they have a new product for securing mobile banking applications,"" Maxa said. ""They're having success in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and several U.S. banks are using or evaluating their mobile products.""Some 95% of Web app attacks make use of compromised credentials, including stolen user names and passwords, according to Verizon Communications' (VZ) 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report.More than 2.4 billion users are expected to embrace mobile banking services by 2020, compared to roughly 800 million in 2014, market tracking firm Research and Markets said in an April report.Growth DriversVasco says more than half of the top 100 global banks use its products and services to protect mobile applications, meet regulatory requirements and enhance overall security. Vasco also secures access to data and applications in the cloud, and provides tools for application developers to integrate security functions into Web-based and mobile applications.Hunt says a confluence of factors is driving its growth: Enterprises need more effective defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, users want security but also convenience, and there's growth in mobile applications.""Our (security) solutions have been battle tested in the most extreme hacking environment — banking — and we believe they will have appeal in many other segments,"" Hunt told IBD.Las Vegas-based Caesars, with some 50 casinos plus resorts and other properties, turned to Vasco for software that enables a user's mobile phone to serve as a secure authentication device.William Worthington, Caesars' chief information security officer, says it wanted an additional authentication layer while not making it too complex for corporate users.""Having a mobile solution makes it simple for employees to comply with a much higher level of security,"" Worthington said.Rabobank looked to Vasco's Digipass technology, with a one-time password that changes every 30 seconds, to enable a large-scale rollout of secure card readers that meet EMV (Europay, MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) standards. Rabobank customers can do e-banking and secure e-commerce with Rabobank's secure smart card readers.Banks, retailers and other merchants in the U.S. are readying to support chip-enabled payment cards by an October 2015 EMV deadline, which shifts liability for fraudulent transactions to whichever entity involved has not yet adopted chip technology.Rabobank's purchases alone accounted for more than 30% of Vasco's Q1 revenue, Vasco noted in its Q1 earnings report on April 28 that beat Wall Street expectations.Vasco's Q1 earnings per share excluding items was 34 cents, up 278% from a year earlier. Revenue increased 68% to $65.1 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected EPS ex items of 21 cents and $54.5 million in revenue.Vasco's Q1 results were spurred by an 83% increase in revenue from the banking market, as financial institutions spend on new software and hardware products, particularly payment card readers. Card readers represented 45% of Q1 revenue, vs. 21% a year earlier.Some 73% of Vasco's Q1 revenue came from the Europe-Middle East-Africa region, and 17% came from Asia, while the U.S. accounted for just 4%, and 6% was from other countries. Vasco boosted its full-year 2015 revenue guidance to a range of between $230 million and $240 million, up from a prior range of $220 million to $230 million, citing ""a strong pipeline of potential new orders"" for its traditional and new authentication and anti-fraud products. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now forecast full-year 2015 revenue of $237.6 million.Vasco faces a wide range of competitors, including more direct rivals such as RSA Security, which is a subsidiary of EMC Corp. (EMC), and Gemalto, as well as other indirect competition from companies such as SafeNet and Symantec (SYMC).Vasco stock currently trades at about 26, down from an all-time high of 44.25 in October 2007.Dougherty's Maxa says Vasco's Digipass for Apps (DPA) product generates a new revenue stream.""It secures mobile banking within the mobile app itself, kind of behind the scenes,"" Maxa said. ""The user may not even know it's there. It's early, but it is being adopted and should help them gain traction in the U.S.""Several banks have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading to their PIN pad tokens,"" Maxa said. ""They're now seeing banks upgrade to their new CrontoSign technology, which is easier to use than their PIN pad tokens. Rabobank placed the largest order in the company's history for this technology, and several other large banks are trialing it. The success of Vasco's e-signature technology is due in part to its ability to prevent man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser type attacks.""How An Attack WorksHunt says a man-in-the-middle attack involves a hacker essentially taking over a banking transaction, changing the payee and amount.""For example, you think you are sending $100 to your mother in Kansas, and they change the transaction to instead send $1,000 to Eastern Europe,"" Hunt said. ""By using a tamper-proof, high-definition color QR (Quick Response) code in the process, it becomes extremely easy for the bank customer to see the true transaction details and then verify them.""Governments are eyeing Vasco's technology, as well.""The Singapore government is offering citizens a free authentication token, named OneKey, using our technology so that citizens can utilize two-factor authentication to have a more secure experience"" accessing government applications online, Hunt said.""In Belgium, the government has a similar vision of allowing citizens to use their government-issued ID to verify their identity, but they want to take advantage of the large number of card readers that are already in use by citizens today,"" Hunt said.Maxa sees Singapore as ""probably a bigger near-term revenue opportunity of the two, as Belgium is in the very early stages.""

Revenue rose 89% to $32.9 million, the third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected EPS ex items of 5 cents on $26.7 million in revenue. CyberArk has had at least 13 straight quarters of double-digit revenue gains.For the current quarter, CyberArk forecasts EPS ex items of 4 cents to 6 cents and revenue of $31.5 million to $32.5 million, up 48% to 52%. Analysts forecast EPS ex items of 4 cents on $30 million in revenue.CyberArk focuses on protecting privileged accounts that serve as gateways to sensitive and valuable information inside their computer networks. Privileged accounts are often exploited in targeted attacks by hackers that can go for months without being detected after gaining access to networks and databases.For 2015, CyberArk has guided its revenue at $136 million to $138 million, up 32% to 34%. It expects non-GAAP EPS of 40 cents to 44 cents.CyberArk stock was up 3% in after-hours trading Thursday, after its earnings release, after closing down 1.7% in the regular session, at 61.33.

CyberArk will not receive any proceeds from the secondary offering, as all of the shares are being sold by CyberArk shareholders.CyberArk stock was down 5% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 53. After wobbling around its 50-day line for the last few months, the stock gapped up almost 15% on Feb. 13 after CyberArk crushed Q4 views, and the stock hit a record high above 70 on Feb. 20.A JPMorgan downgrade on Feb. 23 caused the stock to plunge 17% and it fell another 5% on word of the secondary offering.

693,SYMC,"The rally in the U.S. dollar is expected to go on for some time, despite possible short-term corrections — which means that companies that have international exposure and that price in local currencies could face sustained headwinds.
"
694,SYMC,"In a report this week, Morgan Stanley figures that the U.S. dollar's rally is ""only halfway through"" a bullish cycle — one that it says is the third major U.S. dollar bull market in the last four decades.
"
695,SYMC,"A team of global-currency researchers at Morgan Stanley sees as much as 20% upside in the U.S. dollar over the next three years.
"
696,SYMC,"The team looked at how a stronger dollar would affect a ""typical"" company reporting in U.S. dollars — one that derives 65% of revenue from the Americas, 25% from Europe and surrounding regions, and 10% from Asia Pacific.
"
697,SYMC,"Their conclusion? If current exchange rates hold steady for the rest of 2015, such a ""typical"" company would see revenue hits of more than 6% in each of the first three quarters and 3.4% in Q4. But if Morgan Stanley's own more bullish forecast bears out, they would face additional headwinds of up to 3%.
"
698,SYMC,"Morgan Stanley looked at the impact of foreign exchange on software companies in particular, since they have significant international exposure.
"
699,SYMC,"It wasn't all bad news, they found. Several companies have effective currency hedging policies or price almost exclusively in U.S. dollars, which provide some buffers.
"
700,SYMC,"Morgan Stanley favors security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), analytic software outfit Tableau Software (DATA), enterprise cloud company Workday (WDAY) and customer-service software firm Zendesk (ZEN) because they price mostly or all in U.S. dollars.
"
701,SYMC,"IBD gives software companies Palo Alto Networks and Tableau Software near-perfect Composite Ratings: 98 out of a possible 99.
"
702,SYMC,"On the other hand, companies that price locally, have a large global exposure and no hedge for currency impact ""will likely see the greatest negative impact"" to revenue this year, the Morgan Stanley analysts noted.
"
703,SYMC,"In that sinking boat, they singled out software companies Qlik Technologies (QLIK), VMware (VMW), Oracle (ORCL) and Symantec (SYMC).
"
704,SYMC,"But expenses in foreign markets with weaker local currencies can somewhat protect earnings, if not revenue, the analysts noted. Workday, Palo Alto Networks, Check Point Software (CHKP), Citrix Systems (CTXS), FireEye (FEYE) and Splunk (SPLK) ""may actually see expense benefits"" from the lower U.S. dollar cost of overseas operations.
"
705,SYMC,"Oracle may also have a natural hedge on the bottom line, they noted. Oracle's Composite Rating is a relatively strong 81. Splunk's is 82, and Check Point is ranked 91.
"
706,SYMC,"Analyzing fourth-quarter reports so far, Morgan Stanley said that companies pricing in U.S. dollars have seen much higher upward revisions to revenue estimates than those pricing in local currencies.

707,SYMC,"However, next-day stock performance ""has actually been better for local currency pricers vs. U.S. dollar pricers on average, suggesting investors may be already pricing in these negative FX impacts.""
"
708,SYMC,"That said, the average stock performance since has been ""modestly better"" for firms pricing in U.S. dollars, the analysts noted.The rally in the U.S. dollar is expected to go on for some time, despite possible short-term corrections — which means that companies that have international exposure and that price in local currencies could face sustained headwinds.In a report this week, Morgan Stanley figures that the U.S. dollar's rally is ""only halfway through"" a bullish cycle — one that it says is the third major U.S. dollar bull market in the last four decades.A team of global-currency researchers at Morgan Stanley sees as much as 20% upside in the U.S. dollar over the next three years.The team looked at how a stronger dollar would affect a ""typical"" company reporting in U.S. dollars — one that derives 65% of revenue from the Americas, 25% from Europe and surrounding regions, and 10% from Asia Pacific.Their conclusion? If current exchange rates hold steady for the rest of 2015, such a ""typical"" company would see revenue hits of more than 6% in each of the first three quarters and 3.4% in Q4. But if Morgan Stanley's own more bullish forecast bears out, they would face additional headwinds of up to 3%.Morgan Stanley looked at the impact of foreign exchange on software companies in particular, since they have significant international exposure.It wasn't all bad news, they found. Several companies have effective currency hedging policies or price almost exclusively in U.S. dollars, which provide some buffers.Morgan Stanley favors security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), analytic software outfit Tableau Software (DATA), enterprise cloud company Workday (WDAY) and customer-service software firm Zendesk (ZEN) because they price mostly or all in U.S. dollars.IBD gives software companies Palo Alto Networks and Tableau Software near-perfect Composite Ratings: 98 out of a possible 99.On the other hand, companies that price locally, have a large global exposure and no hedge for currency impact ""will likely see the greatest negative impact"" to revenue this year, the Morgan Stanley analysts noted.In that sinking boat, they singled out software companies Qlik Technologies (QLIK), VMware (VMW), Oracle (ORCL) and Symantec (SYMC).But expenses in foreign markets with weaker local currencies can somewhat protect earnings, if not revenue, the analysts noted. Workday, Palo Alto Networks, Check Point Software (CHKP), Citrix Systems (CTXS), FireEye (FEYE) and Splunk (SPLK) ""may actually see expense benefits"" from the lower U.S. dollar cost of overseas operations.Oracle may also have a natural hedge on the bottom line, they noted. Oracle's Composite Rating is a relatively strong 81. Splunk's is 82, and Check Point is ranked 91.Analyzing fourth-quarter reports so far, Morgan Stanley said that companies pricing in U.S. dollars have seen much higher upward revisions to revenue estimates than those pricing in local currencies.However, next-day stock performance ""has actually been better for local currency pricers vs. U.S. dollar pricers on average, suggesting investors may be already pricing in these negative FX impacts.""That said, the average stock performance since has been ""modestly better"" for firms pricing in U.S. dollars, the analysts noted.

710,SYMC,"Before CEOs such as Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), American Express (AXP) and many other companies, government leaders, law enforcement, educators and students, Obama said the country's economic prosperity, national security and individual liberties depend on a collaborative commitment to securing cyberspace and maintaining a reliable, interoperable, secure, yet open Internet.""Government cannot do this alone,"" he said. ""The fact is that the private sector can't do this alone, either. It's government that often has the latest information on these new threats. We're going to have to be smart and efficient and focus on what each sector does best, and work together.""The president signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for the government to share classified information with companies.The summit and order reflect the urgency that the White House is giving the issue. On Tuesday, it created the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center to streamline and sort cyberthreats collected by various intelligence agencies.Apple's Cook Still SteamedApple CEO Tim Cook agreed that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. But he criticized government violations and touted encryption, something intelligence officials have objected to.""History has shown us that sacrificing our right to privacy can have dire consequences,"" Cook said. ""We shouldn't have to trade our security for the convenience of having all this information at our fingertips.""The summit comes after a year in which companies such as Anthem (ANTM), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT) and Sony (SNE) have suffered costly and embarrassing breaches.Sharing For SecurityObama lauded efforts underway by network security firms such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and Symantec (SYMC) to share information by forming the Cyber Threat Alliance.Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin said in a panel discussion that the alliance is an example of how rivals can work together.""The more we're sharing, the less chance that these attacks will be successful, while dramatically increasing the costs (for cybercriminals),"" he said.Obama called for Congress to pass legislation that gives liability protection to companies that share information and helps streamline the way companies alert customers of breaches.Attendee Muddu Sudhakar, CEO of Palo Alto, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup Caspida, told IBD that he supports such legislation, possibly with tax incentives to encourage businesses to proactively share.""The question is how are we going to make this happen?"" he said.Obama said he chose to hold the event in the heart of Silicon Valley, where much of the innovation in next-generation cybersecurity tools is taking place.CEOs of some Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) chose not to attend, reflecting strained government-industry ties over surveillance exposed by ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Cyberattacks have benefited security companies such as FireEye (FEYE), CyberArk (CYBR) and Qualys (QLYS), which all reported strong results this week.

Global spending on IT security is expected to be more than $71 billion in 2014 and increase to $77 billion in 2015, market tracker Gartner reported.Financial services companies plan to increase spending for cybersecurity budgets by about $2 billion over the next two years, accounting and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers reported on Nov. 17.

780,SYMC,"Symantec (SYMC) used a combination of its restructuring efforts and an extra week in the quarter to post fiscal Q1 earnings late Wednesday that beat analyst expectations.Symantec stock was up 1% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 24. Earlier, Symantec stock rose as much as 6.8%, to a nearly 10-month high.For the quarter ended July 4, Symantec reported earnings per share minus items of 45 cents, up 1 cent from the year-earlier period and 3 cents better than analysts expected.Revenue inched up 1% to $1.735 billion, edging analyst views of $1.7 billion.For the the current quarter, the company expects EPS ex items of 40 cents to 44 cents, down 20% to 12%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now expect 43 cents on average, down 2 cents since the company gave its guidance.The company expects revenue of $1.6 billion to $1.64 billion, down 2.2% to flat. Analysts slightly lowered their revenue expectations to $1.627 billion from $1.63 billion.The results show Symantec still has a lot of work to do as it restructures and hunts for a new CEO, Jonathan Ho, an analyst for William Blair & Co., said in a research report late Wednesday.""Symantec delivered solid quarterly results that beat consensus for both the top and bottom lines but was optically aided by an extra week (about $100 million in contribution) during the quarter and also favorable currency, which accounted for much of the growth during the quarter,"" he wrote. ""In our view, Symantec appears to be at a significant turning point, where its mature businesses look more vulnerable to a technology transition toward advanced-threat detection and the waning of traditional endpoint security efficacy.""We view selection of the next CEO as critical to determining whether the company can successfully transition to addressing the future needs of the endpoint security market, even as the company continues to manage/optimize the decline of legacy markets.""Symantec, the No. 1 maker of anti-virus software, in March fired CEO Steve Bennett, who had cut costs and was amid a major restructuring.

"
804,SYMC,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is expected late Wednesday to report triple-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter, but revenue growth is forecast to hit record deceleration.For its fiscal Q4 2015, the consensus of 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Palo Alto Networks pulling in 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 127% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is forecast to increase 44% up to $256.25 million.While still robust, the revenue increase would be Palo Alto Networks' smallest percentage gain since the company's IPO in December 2010. Over the past year, the Silicon Valley firm has posted revenue growth above the 50%-mark every quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks has handily beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates every quarter this year.Wall Street's Q4 forecast mostly mirrored the company's. During its Q3 earnings conference call, Palo Alto Networks guided to between 24 and 25 cents non-GAAP EPS on $252 million to $256 million in revenue.CEO Mark McLaughlin expressed revenue optimism during a recent company sales event, Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell wrote in a research report.McLaughlin claimed revenue would breach $2 billion over the next two years, Powell wrote.The growth will happen organically, McLaughlin said. But, Powell points out, analysts don't see Palo Alto Networks nearing the $2 billion line. For the year, the consensus models $900.6 million in revenue.""PANW's unofficial target is some 20% above current Street forecasts and implies 40% per year growth vs. the Street (estimate) at 29% for the next two years,"" Powell wrote.Powell acknowledged the comments were likely aspirational, but ""we view the fact they were made just three weeks after the close of FQ4 '15 as an indication that current trends remain strong.""The company's position on Wall Street hasn't been strong recently, however. Palo Alto Networks stock has declined 18% over the past six weeks vs. the Nasdaq drop of 8%.Powell saw the silver lining.""We think this creates a compelling entry point into a high quality/high growth security company that benefits from favorable secular trends,"" he wrote.Palo Alto Networks' marketing efforts have paid off, Powell wrote. Currently, the marketing focus is on endpoint software Traps, the next generation firewall and WildFire, a cloud-based malware analysis machine, he wrote.Powell maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.Palo Alto Networks closed up fractionally Friday at 162.39. With the market in a correction, Palo Alto stock dropped 3.3% for the week after hitting a four-month low at 140.39 on Aug. 24.The same day, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group fell 3.4%, hitting a seven-month low.Palo Alto Networks leads the group with a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

834,SYMC,"Symantec Corp. (SYMC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has enhanced its cloud-based network security solution for better protection of devices across traditional, cloud or mobile end points.The company’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform has been enriched with the first ever Web Isolation technology that is incorporated in Symantec’s Web Security Service (WSS). The service provides protection against cyber threats while browsing. The enhancement has also managed to eliminate the need for an agent to manage traffic flow, with web traffic being redirected to WSS for enforcement of network security policies.Additionally, SD-Cloud Connector will enable users to connect with branch office locations via its cloud security service, given the combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technology and Symantec’s WSS.Notably, as the corporate world is increasingly adopting cloud technology, the need for ensuring security across the network is rising as well. In such a scenario, Symantec’s comprehensive solutions suite is expected to witness steady adoption and benefit its financials.How is Symantec Performing?The company reported strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results with the top and the bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $1.222 billion on a GAAP basis jumped 10% year over year and exceeded the guidance of $1.164-$1.194 billion (mid-point $1.179 billion).However, a weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 made investors skeptical about the company’s near-term prospects. Additionally, the ongoing investigation by the board’s audit committee related to concerns voiced by an ex-employee does not bode well for investors’ confidence.The stock has declined 26.2% since the release of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results whereas the industry rallied 2.7% during the same time frame.Furthermore, margins are anticipated to remain under pressure due to continued shift of the company’s business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity, which makes us cautious about its near-term performance.Currently, Symantec has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for NVIDIA, Western Digital and Micron is currently projected to be 10.25%, 19% and 10%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

Per an article published on CNN.com, the proverb proved itself wrong in the past few years, with the May-October period turning pretty profitable.Maintain a steady trend, May 2018 too witnessed decent performance despite a raft of geopolitical tensions. The S&P 500 index has gained 2.8% in the past one month (as of May 30, 2018) while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite has scored solid gains of 5.6%.Key Events of May The month was packed with global events, which more or less impacted Wall Street too. There was Italy’s political crisis, which sparked fears of the region leaving the Eurozone, although tensions subsided at the end.Oil prices were on a roller-coaster ride thanks to the push and pull between two opposing forces — one is the fear of rising output by Saudi and Russia and the other is the report of lower-than-expected crude inventory built, and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.Then there was uncertainty in diplomatic ties between North Korea and the United States. Trump first pulled out of the scheduled June meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un on May 24, citing North Korea’s “tremendous anger and open hostility” toward Washington. But after North Korea expressed keenness to resolve the issue, an effort to retrieve the canceled summit between the duo was launched. The jostle weighed on the broader stock market for a while.Trade tensions flared up between China and the United States as the latter announced that it will levy 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China and impose new limits on Chinese investments in the United States. Trump also plans restrictions on imported steel and aluminum from Europe.Developments at home were upbeat with President Trump announcing a drug plan which is in line with the best interest of drug makers and deregulations in the banking sector which especially ease rules for smaller financial institutions. Several U.S. economic data also came in better than other developed economies.Against this backdrop, several sectors and their stocks came in upbeat in May while many have fallen apart. So, it would be intriguing to know which stocks gained and which ones lost in in May.Gainers Below we have highlighted three stocks that gained more than 100% in the last four weeks (as of May 30, 2018).

836,SYMC,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in SYMC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 13 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.82 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.60.Also, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents a share from 41 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 20% in the past month.Symantec Corporation Price and Consensus Symantec Corporation Price and Consensus | Symantec Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer – Software industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

837,SYMC,"Shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) recovered part of last Friday’s losses, yesterday, after the company announced a conference call to discuss the ongoing investigation, post market close, which investors believe, will throw light on its internal probe.It should be noted that the company, during the fourth-quarter 2018 earnings conference call, had announced that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, it stated that it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives’ refusal to take questions post the earnings conference call, resulted in a plunge of more than 33% in Symantec’s shares, last Friday, eroding almost $6 billion of the company’s market cap in a single day.However, the stock recovered 9.6% yesterday, following the company’s conference-call announcement. Though Symantec did not reveal much about the internal probe, its announcement reinstated investors’ confidence, reflected by the stock’s 2% improvement, at the after-hour trading.Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry in the year-to-date period. The industry, to which it belongs to, has gained 12.9%, while Symantec has lost 23.7%. The cyber-security provider noted that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company’s historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.Nevertheless, investors heaved a sigh of relief when Symantec mentioned that it “does not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements” at this time.However, we believe its too early to predict what picture the investigation would paint, going forward. This is expected to throw light on serious issues which might severely cost the company in near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Symantec currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PTC Inc. (PTC  -  Free Report), Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) and Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

838,SYMC," Even though it’s in one of the hottest and most in-demand industries – cyber security – and even though it recently reported quarterly earnings that handily beat analyst estimates, Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report) shares have been in a slump of late, losing nearly a quarter of their value so far in 2018, versus a 3% gain in the S&P 500.  The culprit? Reduced guidance in each of the last two quarters and the revelation of an internal investigation that threatens to cast doubt on previously reported results.After reporting earnings of $0.46/share on May 10th, beating the Zacks Consensus estimate of $0.40/share by 15%, Symantec disappointed investors with soft revenue figures and by reducing guidance for the second consecutive quarter, predicting Fiscal year 2019 revenues of $4.83B and earnings of $1.58/share.Analysts were quick to reduce their estimates for the company, with 13 out of 14 represented in the Zacks Consensus Estimates lowering their expectations to an average of $1.59/share, down from $1.82/share just 30 days ago.Symantec is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The real bombshell in the announcement was the news that the company had hired an outside audit firm and opened an internal investigation into its financial reporting practices based on concerns raised by a former employee.  The company did not elaborate on the specific nature of the inquiry, though they did confirm that the issue did not involve a data breach or problem with its services or software.Symantec voluntarily notified the SEC of the investigation.Symantec spooked investors even further by stating that they did not have a time frame for the completion of the investigation other than to say that it would likely delay the filing of the company’s annual 10-K report, and that restatement of previously reported results was a possibility.Even though Symantec has two of the hottest brands in anti-virus and identity theft protection, Norton and LifeLock, the black cloud of accounting irregularities hangs heavy over the shares. Though it’s never positive news, an internal investigation is not necessarily death for a stock, but investors detest uncertainty and Symantec’s decision to not reveal the nature of scope of the potential issue had shareholders running for the exits.Accurate and timely financial data is absolutely necessary for investors to effectively evaluate their holdings. Reducing guidance is a negative development, but the wildcard of possible restatements is far worse. Rational shareholders will steer clear of Symantec until this issue is resolved.In the cyber-security sector, Symantec competitor Fortinet (FTNT  -  Free Report) is a considerably better buy with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

840,SYMC,"Symantec Corporation's (SYMC  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the guidance. Non-GAAP revenues however missed the consensus mark and also fell short of the company’s expectations.Management attributed the dismal revenue performance to a faster-than-expected shift to ratable and subscription-based revenue model, wherein revenues are recognized at a later date. However, management is optimistic about the shift as it promises long-term growth opportunities for the company.The company’s dismal top-line performance sends it shares down 2.3% during yesterday’s after hour trade. Notably, the stock has significantly underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the last one year period. Symantec has lost 0.1% of its value in the said period while the industry is up 42.2%. Quarter in DetailOn a non-GAAP basis, Symantec generated revenues of $1.234 billion, up 13% on a year-over-year basis. The figure also fell short of the mid-point of management’s projection of $1.250-$1.280 billion (mid-point $1.265 billion).Symantec’s revenues of $1.209 billion on a GAAP basis jumped 16% year over year but could not meet the mid-point of its guidance of $1.227-$1.257 billion (mid-point $1.242 billion).Moreover, revenues, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.278 billion.Notably, with a move toward a “more ratable product mix” in the Enterprise revenue model, the company is focusing on implied billings and deferred revenue growth as it provides better predictability as revenues are not recognized upfront.Segment wise, Consumer Digital Safety witnessed an increase of 4% while Enterprise Security division declined 1% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, deferred revenues, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures for Consumer Digital Safety grew 5%. Enterprise Security segment increased 23% on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP implied billings grew 32.1% on a year-over-year basis.Symantec’s non-GAAP gross profit of $985 million was up 15.5%. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin increased 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 79.8%.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income surged 40% year over year to $463 million, while margin expanded 710 bps to 37.5%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was above the high end of the company’s guidance range of 36¬¬–37%. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by increasing operational efficiency “including the completion of the net cost reduction and synergy programs.”Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $328 million compared with $209 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Notably, as a result of the recent tax reforms, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was reduced from 29.5% to 26.8% and the year-to-date tax rate was adjusted accordingly.Management noted that the company received a tax benefit of around $1.6 billion, pertaining to certain “adjustments to previous deferred tax liabilities related to foreign earnings and re-measurement of U.S. deferred income taxes.” However, it was partially counterpoised with a one-time transition tax of $800 million.    The company reported earnings of 49 cents per share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share and increased 53.1% on a year-over-year basis. The figure was positively impacted by elevated operating margins and the changes in effective tax rate.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.532 billion compared with $2.026 billion recorded in the prior quarter. The company ended the third quarter with gross debt of $5.7 billion. Long-term debt was $5.587 billion at the end of fiscal third quarter.During the quarter, Symantec generated operating cash flow of $294 million.GuidanceConsidering the effect of faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition”, the company lowered its revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.For the fiscal, Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of $4.790-$4.820 billion (mid-point $4.805 billion) and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $4.915-$4.945 billion (mid-point $4.930 billion), down from the previous guidance of $4.877-$4.977 billion (mid-point $4.927 billion) and $5 -$5.1 billion (mid-point $5.087 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at $5.04 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between $1.60 and $1.64, down from the earlier forecast of $1.66-$1.76. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.68.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Symantec anticipates GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.164-$1.194 billion (mid-point $1.179 billion) and $1.175-$1.205 billion (mid-point $1.190 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 33-34%. However, on a GAAP basis, it expects to report an operating margin between (1%) to break-even. Further, management estimates earnings between 37 cents and 41 cents on a non-GAAP basis for the fiscal fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 50 cents.Bottom LineThe company’s cross selling strategies are proving to be worthy. Realignment of the sales force increased deals worth above $1 million from 37 in the first quarter to over 100 in the third quarter. The accelerated adoption of the company’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform and cloud proxy solution is a major tailwind for the company.Notably, Symantec’s acquisition of BlueCoat, which assisted the company in winning a deal with a prominent construction company during the quarter, is encouraging. The addition of a Fortune 500 financial services company to its clientele is yet another positive.However, management slightly disappointed as it was not able to properly assess the faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition”. Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the long-term performance of the company due to the shift in the subscription-based revenue model as customers are increasingly preferring the same.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSymantec has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc.

841,SYMC,"Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) is slated to release its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 31. The question lingering on investors’ minds is if this cyber security provider will be able to deliver a positive surprise this time around.Notably, Symantec has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matched once and fell short on the other occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat estimates this quarter, as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -1.38%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter earnings is pegged at 44 cents per share. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.26 billion.Factors to ConsiderA surge in demand for cybersecurity-related products due to the recent global hacking events is a key growth factor for Symantec. The two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry (or WannaCrypt) in May and Petya in June last year — along with data breach at Equifax, are likely to continue impacting the demand positively.The company also enriched its solutions portfolio with a comprehensive cloud security solution during the quarter, which is also expected to benefit the top line going forward. Notably, the company added British Telecommunications to its clientele during the quarter, yet another positive.Additionally, during the third-quarter the company announced that the principal components of its Integrated Cyber Defense platform are now accessible through Oracle Cloud Marketplace, which is expected to expand its presence in the market.However, we are skeptical about the company’s divestment of the high-margin certified authority business to DigiCert Inc. The division was sold in October 2017 and the loss of high margin associated with this business may drag on Symantec’s profitability.Moreover, we are apprehensive about the company’s lowered revenues and non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 due to the effect of faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition.”Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteSome Stocks with a Favorable CombinationHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Facebook, Inc.

842,SYMC,"Some new tech trends, like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, promise massive growth in the future. Others, like cyber security, are in demand right now. Nevertheless, not every cyber security firm has been witnessed consistent success. Today’s “Bear of the Day” is one of the struggling stocks in this industry, Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report).Symantec is one of the world’s largest cyber security firms. The company’s Norton brand is a major player on the consumer security side of things, while its enterprise offerings are used by a number of businesses around the world.A few months ago, Symantec shares plummeted after the company reported dismal results and lowered its outlook. Now, as we approach Symantec’s fiscal third quarter earnings report date, the stock is once again looking risky. The stock is currently holding a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Latest Earnings and OutlookSymantec reported its second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Nov. 1. On a non-GAAP basis, the company generated revenues of $1.276 billion, up 26% year-over-year but below our consensus estimate of $1.278 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents per share missed our consensus estimate by three cents.The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more “ratable revenue recognition,” which resulted in lower-than-expected revenue growth. Considering this effect, Symantec now expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.250 - $1.280 billion. Further, management predicts earnings between 42 cents and 46 cents for the third quarter.Analysts have put their projections right in the middle of these ranges. Our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to report earnings of 44 cents per share and revenues of $1.26 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 37.5% and 21.5%, respectively. Those growth rates may seem exciting, but considering the company’s recent acquisition activity, this expansion—particularly on the revenue side—is likely to disappoint many investors.Key MetricsDespite a slump that has seen the stock lose about 17% over the past 12 weeks, Symantec shares are still trading at 25x earnings and nearly 4x sales. These figures are not horrible for a tech company, but considering that you are not exactly buying in at a moment of strength, we can hardly consider the company a great value option.Meanwhile, we have seen analyst sentiment cool even further as we approach the company’s earnings report date. One way to gauge this is looking at the Zacks Earnings ESP figure. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.Right now, SYMC has an Earnings ESP of -1.38%. This means that the most recent estimates are below the consensus estimate. That type of analyst activity in the days closest to the report is not a good sign.Want more analysis from this author?

844,SYMC,"If you are still holding on to shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Symantec has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has lost 24.4% of its value in the year-to-date period, substantially underperforming the 17% rally of its industry it belongs to.Let’s take a look at factors behind this plunge.Investigation Woes Pulling Share Price DownThe plunge particularly came after the company, during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call, reported that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into the concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, Symantec stated that it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives’ refusal to take questions post the earnings conference call, has resulted in a plunge of more than 27% in Symantec’s shares since May 10 to till day.Later, on May 14, this cyber-security provider held another press meet and stated that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company’s historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.We believe this information is inadequate to gain investors’ confidence. The ongoing investigation may throw light on some serious issues which might severely cost the company in the near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Dismal Outlook Dims Near-Term ProspectsSymantec’s weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 makes investors cautious about its near-term performance. Also, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2019 in the range of 30-32%, which reflects a substantial decline from the fiscal 2018 level of 34.7%. The reduction in margins is mainly due to continued shift of business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity.Downward Estimate RevisionFollowing the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and investigation revelation, the stock has witnessed sharp downward estimate revision.

847,SYMC,"Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 10.Notably, Symantec has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matched it once and fell short of the same on one occasion. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSymantec’s continuous efforts to strengthen its product suite are likely to benefit its top line, given the surge in demand for cybersecurity-related products.

The buyouts have helped it reduce its dependency on the PC market and strengthen position in the enterprise security market.However, we remain slightly cautious about the company’s lower-than-expected revenues in the last reported quarter due to a faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition.” This might impact financials in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

As per the company’s first quarter fiscal 2018 results, server product and cloud services revenues went up 17% year over year, with Azure revenues soaring 89% in the same period.Microsoft is also gaining from its increasing traction in blockchain technology. Its collaboration with Bank Hapoalim for the use of blockchain technology for digital bank guarantees is aiding Azure to penetrate the cloud market.Recently, the company released updates for Windows to prevent malware attacks from exploiting Meltdown Vulnerability in Intel x86-64 processors.

"
851,SYMC,"Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results with the top and the bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the company’s own guidance. Moreover, revenues and earnings marked a significant increase on a year-over-year basis.Despite this, shares are trading almost 34% down today as the Internet security solution provider revealed that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems. Symantec said that the matter has been relayed to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Apart from this, a weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 made investors skeptical about the company’s near-term prospects.Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The industry, to which it belongs, has gained 34.1% while Symantec has lost 40%.Let’s discuss quarterly results in details.Quarter in DetailOn a non-GAAP basis, Symantec generated revenues of $1.234 billion, up 5% on a year-over-year basis. The figure also came ahead of management’s projection of $1.175-$1.205 billion (mid-point $1.190 billion).Revenues of $1.222 billion on a GAAP basis jumped 10% year over year and surpassed its guidance of $1.164-$1.194 billion (mid-point $1.179 billion).Moreover, revenues, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.194 billion.Large number of deal wins resulting from increased cross-selling in the Enterprise Security segment and successful integration of the sales force team mainly drove the top line. The number of deals, worth more than $1 million, again topped the 100 mark. The company also noted that it has won a large number of deals worth more than $5 million during the quarter.Notably, the company is shifting its business model to a more ratable-based one. In the fourth quarter, the company noted that 80% of Enterprise Security segment revenues were ratable. A ratable business model provides better predictability of revenues.Additionally, contract length improved to 18.5 months during the quarter from 18 months in the preceding quarter. Symantec noted that contract duration has shown drastic improvement in the last four quarters. In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, contract duration was 15.5 months and 16.5 months, respectively.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income surged 44% year over year to $451 million, while margin expanded 980 basis points (bps) to 36.5%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was above the high end of the company’s guided range of 33-34%. The year-over-year upside was mainly driven by increased operational efficiency, including the completion of net cost reduction and synergy programs.Non-GAAP net income in the reported quarter came in at $310 million compared with $184 million a year ago.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 46 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and increased 64% on a year-over-year basis. The improvement was driven by higher revenues and operating margin.Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.162 billion compared with $2.532 billion in the prior quarter.

854,SYMC,"Are you still holding shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) in your portfolio? If yes, then this is the best time to dump the stock as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear slim.The stock has underperformed the industry in the past six months. Symantec’s shares have registered a return of 7.3%, compared with the industry’s gain of 14.9%. Also, the company declined more than 3% in yesterday’s trading session.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what is dragging this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company down.Growth ImpedimentsDuring first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Symantec announced that privately-owned DigiCert Inc. has agreed to buy its Website Security business for $950 million in cash and approximately a 30% stake in the latter’s business. Symantec’s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites. We believe the latest move is Symantec’s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) which has accused the company for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications. However, it should be noted that its certified authority business was a very high margin business. Consequently, we have grown increasingly cautious regarding Symantec’s profitability in the near future as it will lose the high margin associated with this business.Furthermore, changing customer spending behavior makes us pretty skeptical about Symantec’s near-term performance. Moreover, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), remain headwinds.Sales of Symantec’s security solutions have also been affected by the shrinking PC market. According to Gartner’s latest report, PC shipments (including premium ultra-mobiles) in second-quarter 2017 fell 4.3% year over year to 61.1 million units. The decline marked eleventh straight quarter of year-over-year fall which according to the research firm is the longest ever duration of decline in the history of the PC industry. Further, the second-quarter shipment marked the lowest volume since 2007. IDC too has almost similar tallies. Per the research firm, worldwide PC shipment totalled 60.5 million in the second quarter, representing a decline of 3.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, the decline was lower than IDC’s earlier forecast of 3.9%. The cannibalization of PCs by mobile devices is hurting overall demand. The continuous decline in PC shipments will negatively impact the company’s Norton Anti-Virus sales.Low ReturnGiven the other unattractive attributes like low return on equity (ROE), low return on capital (ROC) and low return on assets (ROA), makes the stock look very unappealing. Symantec currently trades at a ROE of 21.6%, much lower than the industry’s average of 31.2%. Notably, the company has an ROC and ROA of 3.9% and 4.7% compared with the industry’s average of 16.1% and 10.6%, respectively.ValuationWe note that the Symantec currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 57.25. This level compares unfavorably to some extent with what the industry saw over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 44.36 and is toward its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.Last WordWe expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company’s near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from Symantec shares until its Zacks Rank and fundamentals improve.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

855,SYMC,"Cybersecurity stocks were seen soaring last Friday, after Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) reported a massive data breach. Per the company, highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been affected due to this cyber attack.The company late last Thursday announced that a data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Apart from some sensitive personal information, hackers have stolen credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.This is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 14% last Friday after news of the cyber attack surfaced.Cybersecurity Stocks SoarThe recent cyber attack at Equifax proved that most organizations across the world lack proper security measures.Nonetheless, believe it or not, there is a positive side to this episode.  A cyber attack is good news for cybersecurity companies because it increases the chances of security-related purchases by the companies and governments. Hence, investors flock to these shares, shooting up share prices.Equifax’s Thursday’s announcement gave a sharp boost to cybersecurity stocks, particularly identity protection security providers.Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report), which has been enhancing its identity-theft protection capabilities through acquisitions like LifeLock, gained the most with its shares witnessing a 3.4% rise.This was followed by FireEye, Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report), which is specialized in providing web security, email security, file security and malware analysis. The stock gained 1.5% last Friday.Another cybersecurity company, Proofpoint, Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), went up 5.8% during trading hours. But it lost its momentum later to close at just 0.3% higher. The company is one of the leading security-as-a-service providers and focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnFresh Boost for Security StocksSo far, the year 2017 has witnessed massive cyber attacks, including the two ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May and Petya in June — which created global havoc. However, the silver lining to this entire episode will be the further rise in demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. This is anticipated to drive share prices to new highs in the rest of 2017.Furthermore, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises, as well as governments to increase spending on cyber security software. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020.Here we pick three stocks that are expected to benefit from this higher spending. Moreover, these have a favorable combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), with a Growth Score of A or B. Back-tested results show that this combination can handily beat other stocks.Imperva Inc. (IMPV  -  Free Report) is engaged in the development of protection software and services for business applications and databases. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leidos Holdings, Inc.

Symantec is already a Gold-level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN).Notably, in an era when organizations are rapidly shifting to cloud infrastructure, security breach related issues are turning out to be the primary concern.

SAP’s privately managed cloud service known as SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud will run on Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure that will enable customers to deploy SAP S/4HANA in a secured cloud environment.Moreover, Microsoft will be using SAP S/4HANA on Azure for its own financial processes.

Given the widespread adoption of cloud, Microsoft’s initiatives to tap this growing sector seem apt. This partnership with SAP is also expected to provide the company with a competitive edge against cloud market leader Amazon Web Services.The adoption of Microsoft’s Azure has been strong as evident from its strong customer base, which witnessed an 89% year-over-year increase at constant currency in fiscal first-quarter 2018.

858,SYMC,"CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company posted positive earnings surprise of 7.7%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in the security system, and secure cloud-based assets.CyberArk recently announced preliminary results for second-quarter 2017.The company projects second-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $57–$57.5 million, down from the previous guidance of $61–$62 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $63.3 million. License revenue is anticipated in the range of $30–$30.5 million. Non-GAAP operating income is predicted to be in the range of $8.5–$8.9 million, down from the earlier guidance of $10.9–$11.7 million.CyberArk provided not-so-encouraging guidance for the second quarter, due to lower-than-expected business in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA). Udi Mokady, CEO of CyberArk, said, ""The primary reason for our revenue shortfall was our performance in EMEA, where certain deals that we anticipated would close did not close by the end of the quarter.""While maintaining its earnings streak for the 11th consecutive quarter, CyberArk reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2017 results. However, in the last two quarters, the company reported the slowest revenue growth rate of around 25% since it was enlisted in Sep 2014. Prior to this, CyberArk witnessed more than 35% revenue growth every quarter.Moreover, intense competition from peers such as CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corp. along with an uncertain macroeconomic environment adds to its woes.Nonetheless, we are optimistic about CyberArk, given a healthy security market, strong product lineup, deal wins and investment plans, which are likely to boost results in the long run.

861,SYMC,"It has been nearly two weeks that Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Ever since Symantec reported its quarterly numbers on Nov 1, the company’s shares have lost more than 13%.The downtrend stemmed from the company’s dismal second-quarter results wherein its top and bottom line both fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, revenues were in line with the mid-point of the company’s guidance range, while non-GAAP earnings came in at the lower end.In addition to this, the cybersecurity company issued disappointing guidance for the next quarter’s revenues and earnings, as both fell short of the respective consensus estimates. Moreover, the company’s dismal outlook for the full fiscal makes investors worried about its near-term performance.Notably, Symantec has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 17.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 36.1% during the same time frame.Unfavorable Estimate RevisionsFollowing Symantec’s dismal performance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a downtrend as analysts decreased their estimates. Analysts polled by Zacks are convinced that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock may witness a lackluster performance in the future as well. Over the past 30 days, the Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2018 moved down by 6 cents and 11 cents, respectively.What’s Bothering Analysts?Analysts covering the stock are cautious about Symantec’s future performance due to the factors highlighted by management during the fiscal second-quarter earnings conference call. The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more ratable revenue recognition, which resulted in lower-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter.Per Symantec, “Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi-product deals, which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures. These trends are however also affecting our in-period revenue recognition. The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud, subscription and virtual appliance products in multi-product deals.”The company expects the aforementioned factors will continue to impact its near-term results. Therefore, it lowered its revenues and non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018.Looking aheadApart from the booking mix issue, there is another factor which makes us increasingly cautious about Symantec’s near-term performance. It should be noted that last month the company announced accomplishing the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc. This move is believed to be Symantec’s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications.However, we believe that although the sale of the company’s certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet, the loss of high-margin business might hurt Symantec’s near-term profitability.Therefore, we suggest investors to stay away from investing in this stock till we find a better visibility on the company’s growth opportunities.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are Blackbaud, Inc.

862,SYMC,"Shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) dipped nearly 9% during yesterday’s after-hour trade after the company reported lower-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2018. Furthermore, revenues matched the mid-point of the company’s guidance range, while non-GAAP earnings came in at the lower end.The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more “ratable revenue recognition”, which resulted in lower-than-expected revenue growth.Per the company, “Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi-product deals, which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures. These trends are however also affecting our in-period revenue recognition. The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud, subscription and virtual appliance products in multi-product deals.”Notably, over the past year, Symantec has returned 26.4%, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 39.3%, to which it belongs to.Quarter in DetailSymantec’s revenues of $1.240 billion jumped 26.7% year over year and came in line with the mid-point of its guidance range of $1.225-$1.255 billion (mid-point $1.240 billion). The robust top-line result was mainly driven by acquisitions. On a constant currency adjusted for acquisitions basis, revenues were flat year over year.On a non-GAAP basis, the company generated revenues of $1.276 billion, up 26% from $1.015 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also came in at the mid-point of management’s projection of $1.260-$1.290 billion (mid-point $1.275 billion).However, quarterly revenues, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis both, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.278 billion.Segment wise, the Consumer Digital Safety and Enterprise Security divisions witnessed a 42% and 14% year-over-year increase, respectively. However, on constant currency adjusted for acquisition basis, Consumer Digital Safety registered 1% growth, while the Enterprise Security division’s revenues were flat year over year.Symantec’s non-GAAP gross profit of $1.075 billion was up 26.3%, primarily attributable to a higher revenue base. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 86.7%, as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by elevated cost of goods sold.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income surged 47% year over year to $435 million, while margin expanded 490 bps to 35.1%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was approximately at the mid-point of the company’s guidance range of 34-36%. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by strong revenue growth, and benefited from better execution of the company’s cost-saving initiatives and synergies from acquisitions.Per Symantec, it has realized over $580 million of cost through its cost-restructuring initiatives and cost synergies from the acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock, which is way ahead of its planned time of the end of fiscal 2018. Till fiscal 2017, the company has achieved more than $300 million in net cost efficiencies.Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $268 million compared with $192 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share climbed 33.3% year over year to 40 cents and came at the lower-end of the company’s projected range of 40-44 cents.Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.026 billion compared with $2.306 billion recorded in the prior quarter. It should be noted that the company had repaid $2 billion of its debt during the fiscal first quarter, as a result of which its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments had declined to $2.306 billion in the previous quarter from $4.247 billion reported at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $6.079 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.During the first half of fiscal 2018, Symantec generated operating cash flow of $390 million. It paid $114 million as dividend during the period.GuidanceConsidering the effect of faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition”, the company lowered its revenues and non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018.For the fiscal, Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of $4.877-$4.977 billion (mid-point $4.927 billion) and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $5-$5.1 billion (mid-point $5.05 billion), down from the previous guidance ranges of $5.037-$5.137 billion (mid-point $5.087 billion) and $5.160-$5.260 billion (mid-point $5.210 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at $5.19 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between $1.66 and $1.76, down from the earlier forecast of $1.79-$1.89. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.81.The company provided guidance for the third quarter as well. For the quarter, Symantec anticipates GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.227-$1.257 billion (mid-point $1.242 billion) and $1.250-$1.280 billion (mid-point $1.265 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.34 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 36-37%. However, on a GAAP basis, it expects to report negative operating margin in the range of 2-3%. Further, management predicts reporting earnings between 42 cents and 46 cents on a non-GAAP basis for the fiscal third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents.Website Security Business Divestment CompletedSymantec announced that it has completed the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc. The company received $950 million in cash and approximately a 30% stake in DigiCert’s business. Symantec’s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites.We believe the recent move is an effort by Symantec to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications.Our TakeWe predict that the faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition” will continue to drag down the company’s near-term results. However, over the long run, this initiative will result in higher number of large and multi product deal wins, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Furthermore, we consider that although the sale of its certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet, the high margin of the sold business may depress Symantec’s near-term profitability.Additionally, smaller companies like Kaspersky are constantly launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), remain headwinds.Currently, Symantec carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Let us see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTiVo reported strong results for first-quarter 2017, wherein both the top line and bottom line came ahead of our expectations. This can primarily be attributed to the inclusion of the recently merged TiVo’s business, new licensing agreements, as well as the introduction of innovative products.Prior to the acquisition, Rovi provided a set of solutions that allowed businesses to protect, enable and distribute digital goods to consumers, aiding them discover and manage digital media across multiple channels. Meanwhile, TiVo pioneered a brand new category of products by developing the first commercially available digital video recorder. However, over the years, the company expanded capabilities beyond hardware sales and patent licensing to online subscription services.The merger has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry, with complementary products and services as well as a number of patented technologies. The two companies have been witnessing stiff competition from Internet video providers such as Alphabet’s YouTube, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Apple and Roku. Notably, these two companies were arch rivals and their merger will prove to be mutually beneficial.The new TiVo is the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to DVR. The combined company has emerged as the world’s leading media and entertainment provider to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience.Apart from this, the combined company has over 6,000 issued and pending patents, which offer it a competitive advantage over other media and tech giants.Nonetheless, the actual synergies from the merger will take some time to reflect in the  performance and much depends on how successfully it integrates the legacy business of TiVo.TiVo Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  TiVo Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TiVo Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TiVowill beat on earnings this quarter.

864,SYMC,"We expect Arrow Electronics, Inc. (ARW  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Arrow is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Arrow’s Earnings ESP is +1.13%.

QuoteWhat is Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?We note that Arrow has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.9%.Recently, Arrow has teamed up with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) to deliver pioneering solutions to accelerate growth of Internet of Things (IoT) in Asia Pacific. The integration will enable the company to become a key player in the automotive and industrial IoT segments. Given the ever-increasing number of connected products making their way into our everyday lives, IoT is poised to grow strongly. This alliance provides it with some key capabilities to cater to this huge opportunity.Original equipment manufacturers, contract manufacturers and commercial customers are selecting Arrow’s distribution channels for marketing their products. The company’s core strength in providing best-in-class services and easy-to-acquire technologies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth in the quarters ahead.Meanwhile, incremental sales from strategic acquisitions, such as Computerlinks, are anticipated to boost the top line.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our proven model shows these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CA Inc.

865,SYMC,"Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 1.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 43 cents, which represents year-over-year growth of 42.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.28 billion, up 30.6% from the year-ago quarter level.Rise in demand for cybersecurity-related products due to the recent global hacking events, along with acquisitions, are likely to drive Symantec’s fiscal second-quarter overall results. However, divestment of the company’s high-margin certified authority business may undermine profitability.Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteTo Benefit From Rising DemandCybersecurity companies stand to gain from data breaches as chances of security-related purchases shoot up. The demand for cybersecurity-related products have got fresh momentum by the two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — which created global havoc.Apart from this, data breach at Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report), which was discovered this September, is likely to have a positive impact on cybersecurity-related products’ demand, particularly identity protection security providers. Symantec, which has been enhancing its identity-theft protection capabilities through acquisitions like LifeLock, will surely have cashed on this opportunity.Acquisitions to Drive RevenuesSymantec has taken the acquisition route to redeem its struggling business. In the last few quarters, the company acquired businesses like Blue Coat, LifeLock, Skycure and Fireglass. The acquisitions have helped Symantec broaden its product portfolio and enhance the company’s capabilities in areas such as identity, mobile and web protection, which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology.The buyouts have helped it reduce its dependency on the PC market and strengthen position in the enterprise security market. It should be noted that the company was facing severe competition from Palo-Alto Networks and FireEye in the enterprise segment market.Additionally, the acquisitions have broadened Symantec’s customer base. Therefore, we anticipate this strategy to drive the company’s to-be-reported quarters’ revenues and earnings.Website Security Divestment Might Hurt profitabilityDuring the first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Symantec announced that privately-owned DigiCert Inc. has agreed to buy its Website Security business for $950 million in cash and approximately a 30% stake in the latter’s business. Symantec’s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites. We believe the latest move is Symantec’s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications. However, it should be noted that the company’s certified authority business was a very high-margin business. Therefore, we are increasingly cautious that the loss of high margin associated with this business may drag Symantec’s profitability in the near future.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Symantec has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% but carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

872,SYMC,"Shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) remained highly volatile during yesterday’s after-hour trade, with the stock surging as much as 6%, but eventually closing trade at a nominal gain of just 0.2%. There were a plenty of reasons which boosted the company’s shares, which includes a better-than-expected first-quarter bottom-line result, upbeat fiscal 2018 revenue guidance and an agreement relating to the sale of its web certificates business.Notably, Symantec has been clocking solid returns and in the year-to-date period it has gained approximately 29.4%, outperforming 21.3% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.First thing first, let’s discuss the quarterly performance.Quarter in DetailSymantec’s revenues of $1.175 billion jumped 32.9% year over year and came ahead of its guidance range of $1.133–$1.163 billion (mid-point $1.148 billion). The robust top-line results were mainly driven by strong performance across the company’s Enterprise Security and Consumer Digital Safety segments, as well as benefit from acquisitions and favourable currency exchange rates. However, the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.204 billion.On non-GAAP basis, the company posted revenues of $1.228 billion, up 39% from $884 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also came in higher than management’s projection of $1.185–$1.215 billion (mid-point $1.20 billion).Segment wise, the Consumer Security as well as Enterprise Security, both divisions witnessed a 39% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP revenues.Symantec’s non-GAAP gross profit of $1.032 billion was up 39%, primarily attributable to a higher revenue base. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 84%, as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher cost of goods sold.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income surged 49% year over year to $377 million while margin improved 210 bps to 30.7%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was higher than the company’s guidance range of 27–29%. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and benefited from better execution of the company’s cost-saving initiatives and synergies from acquisitions.Per Symantec, it now expects to realize over $580 million of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018 through its cost-restructuring initiatives and cost synergies from the acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock. The figure is $30 million higher than the company’s previous projection of realizing $550 million of cost savings. Till fiscal 2017, the company has achieved over $300 million in net cost efficiencies.Non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $221 million compared with $177 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 13.8% year over year to 33 cents and came above the company’s projected range of 28–32 cents.Symantec’s adjusted earnings (excluding all one-time items but including stock-based compensation on proportionate tax basis) came in at 15 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents. However, on a year-over-year basis, it plunged 34.8%.Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Symantec Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.306 billion compared with $4.247 billion last quarter. The company repaid $2 billion of its debt during the quarter, as a result of which its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments declined sequentially. Long-term debt (including current portion) came down to $6.202 billion from $8.186 billion at the end of the previous quarter.During the quarter, Symantec generated operating cash flow of $213 million. In addition, it paid $66 million as dividend during the period.GuidanceBeating its own guidance range at every point made the company optimistic about its solid prospects and therefore, it raised its fiscal 2018 revenue and non-GAAP earnings outlook. For the fiscal, Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of $5.037–$5.137 billion (mid-point $5.087 billion) and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $5,160–$5,260 billion (mid-point $5.210 billion), up from the previous guidance ranges of $4.977–$5.077 billion (mid-point $5.02 billion) and $5,100–$5,200 billion (mid-point $5.150 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at $5.15 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between $1.79 and $1.89, up from the earlier forecast of $1.75–$1.85. However, forecast for non-GAAP operating margin has been reiterated at 36–37%.The company initiated guidance for the second quarter as well. For the quarter, Symantec anticipates GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.225–$1.255 billion (mid-point $1.24 billion) and $1.260–$1.290 billion (mid-point $1.275 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.26 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 34–36%. However, on a GAAP basis it expects to report negative operating margin in the range of 2–4%. Further, management predicts reporting loss between 11 cents and 15 cents on a GAAP basis for the fiscal second quarter. However, on a non-GAAP basis, it estimates earnings between 40 cents and 44 cents.Divestment of Website Security BusinessIn a separate news release, Symantec announced that privately owned DigiCert Inc. has agreed to buy its Website Security business for $950 million in cash and approximately a 30% stake in the latter’s business. Symantec’s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites.We believe that the recent move is an effort by Symantec to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications.Our TakeSymantec reported mixed first-quarter results, wherein the bottom line came ahead of our expectations, while the top line missed the same. However, the company has surpassed its own expectation at every point, which makes us confident that its turnaround efforts are in the right direction. Also, the impressive third-quarter guidance and upbeat fiscal 2018 outlook make us optimistic about its growth opportunities.Going ahead, the prospects of cybersecurity companies look bright as the recent global hackings, like WannaCry and Petya, have started to adversely affect the top- and bottom-line results of various organizations like Mondelez, FedEx and Merck & Co. The silver lining in this entire episode will be the rise in demand for security-related products among companies and governments, in our opinion.We believe that this could bring Symantec back into the limelight. Moreover, the recent deal to acquire Israel-based Fireglass will further strengthen Symantec’s leadership position in Secure Web Gateway and Email protection, both delivered on premises and in the cloud.Also, investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are likely to boost Symantec’s long-term prospects. Additionally, restructuring initiatives and synergies from acquisitions are likely to support the company’s bottom line.Nonetheless, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), remain headwinds.Currently, Symantec sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Some other stocks in the same industry space are Red Hat, Inc.

According to the report, earnings of these companies are up 11.3% from the same period last year, while revenues have increased 6.1%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally see back-to-back four quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 9.2% from the year-ago period, while total revenue will be up 5%.The earnings reporting cycle for the second quarter is in full swing, with results of over 1000 companies, including 130 S&P 500 members scheduled to be out this week. Out of these, a number of tech companies are slated to report quarterly figures over the next few days. So far, the earnings scenario for the overall sector has been pretty impressive.Technology Stocks Continue to OutperformAlthough the Q2 earnings growth is broad based, majority of the contribution is coming from three sectors, Technology being one among them. The other two solid performing sectors are Finance and Energy.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, 66.1% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index has already reported, as of Jul 28.

Earnings of these companies are up 18.8% from the same period last year, while revenues increased 8.4%.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis.

881,SYMC,"We expect cybersecurity company, Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report), to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 2.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 75%. Notably, Symantec has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. The stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, missed the same in one occasion and came in line with the other, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 13.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Symantec is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Symantec currently has an Earnings ESP of +16.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 14 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate comes in lower at 12 cents. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that the worldwide Information Security spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, marking 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We believe that Symantec must have capitalized on this opportunity. We anticipate that this might be well reflected in the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the company’s mobile and cloud security products are gradually gaining market acceptance. The storage and server management business provides recovery solutions and heterogeneous storage-end server platforms. We believe that these innovative products and solutions will have helped Symantec win customers in the last quarter, thus increasing its business volume.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Salesforce.com Inc.

884,SYMC,"Flex Ltd. (FLEX  -  Free Report) reported fiscal first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 21 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings declined almost 11.6% year over year to 24 cents per share.Revenues increased 2.2% from the year-ago quarter to $6.01 billion, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of almost $5.89 billion and were toward the top-end of management’s guided range of $5.7–$6.1 billion.Notably, the company’s partnership with Nike in 2015 to improve its supply chain and the latter’s product solutions has increased Flex’s operating expenses and adversely impacted its bottom line.We note that the company has also underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 13.5%, the stock returned 13.3% over the same time frame.Quarter DetailsCommunications & Enterprise Compute (CEC) revenues declined $13 million from the year-ago quarter. This segment generated $49 million in adjusted operating profit and recorded 2.5% adjusted operating margin. Lower profitability was due to 10% lower revenue levels.Consumer Technologies Group (CTG) revenues advanced 15% from the year-ago quarter to $1.5 billion. This division produced $18 million in adjusted operating profit, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 1.2%, which missed the management’s targeted range of 2% to 4% for this business. The weak adjusted operating profit was directly the result of the elevated level of operating losses due to its strategic partnership with Nike.Management noted that Flex’s partnership with Nike witnessed a lot of incremental investments for vertical integration of technologies, which increased operating expenses, thus elevating operating losses. However, management is hopeful that once the integration is completed and challenges of the partnership are addressed, profits will increase.Flextronics International Ltd.

At constant currency (cc), storage revenues were up 10.6% to $590.2 million while service revenues grew 5.1% to $359.6 million. The company achieved internal storage rental growth of 4.8% in the quarter.Iron Mountain reported adjusted EBITDA of $318.1 million compared with $261.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 390 basis points (bps) to 33.5% from 29.6% in the year-ago quarter.Per the company, year–over-year improvement in top-line and bottom-line result were mainly driven by synergies from Recall Holdings acquisition, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business.We note that on a year-to-date basis, the stock has gained 7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3.2%.Quarter DetailsOperating expenses decreased 1% year over year to $779.6 million. Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 14.3% from the year-ago quarter to $237.4 million. Depreciation & Amortization advanced 11.4% year over year to $128.1 million.Operating income increased 76.1% from the year-ago quarter to $170.2 million.

Long-term debt was $6.03 billion compared with $5.92 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.OutlookThe company has reiterated outlook for the full year. Iron Mountain still expects revenues to be in the range of $3.750–$3.840 billion, reflecting 8–10% growth year over year.Similarly, adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.250–$1.280 billion, representing growth of 16–19%, is still maintained. Adjusted FFO is expected to be in the range of $715–$760 million.Internal storage rental growth rate is expected to be 2.5–3% in 2017. Capital expenditures along with non-real estate investment are projected to be in a bracket of $150–$170 million.Our TakeIron Mountain’s diversified revenue base is a positive. It is noteworthy that 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies are on Iron Mountain’s client list. Additionally, its strong product portfolio, increasing market share, and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, the company’s entry into the data center market is likely to be a growth driver.Furthermore, the company has an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth in storage revenues. The acquisition of Recall Holdings has been positive for the company. Apart from generating synergies worth $105 million, the buyout also expanded its footprint in international markets.However, the costs of such initiatives are expected to weigh on financials, especially as the company already has a highly leveraged balance sheet. Also, volatile currency environment and intensifying competition remain overhangs.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Iron Mountain carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the tech sector include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA  -  Free Report), Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report) and Symantec Corp. (SYMC  -  Free Report).

890,SYMC,"Mobile devices, the chunky things that allowed us to take a call without getting up, were such a big deal just a few years ago. But as the days go by, they seem to be getting more and more capable, all the while becoming slimmer and cooler as well! No wonder then that today, they are being snapped up by kids, oldies and pretty much everyone in between.Considering their broad adoption and usefulness, one would have thought that there’d be a ton of companies out there, taking care of security as we browse the net, shop, play, socialize, read, watch video, listen to music, or work (or any of the other stuff I forgot to mention!). But that isn’t the way we function it seems because most individuals are comfortable enough even without security and have limited knowledge of the consequences. So mobile security hasn’t really gained momentum, even in places like the U.S., where 70%+ of the population has a device.Why Things Are Changing TodayThe first and biggest reason is the increasing usefulness of smart devices. Because these devices are always connected, they are more accessible to viruses, unsafe sites, etc. Moreover, people increasingly use them for shopping, entertainment, to consume media, or make payments, and tend to save passwords on the device itself. This also increases the danger of identity theft. The fact that they are moveable items that can easily be stolen or misplaced makes them all the more susceptible.So as the number of devices continues to increase, with smartphones, tablets, phablets, chromebooks, surfaces, smart watches, AR/VR devices, connected dashboards, smart  home products and other IoT devices, more information gets online with greater scope for infection or attacks. IDC expects smartphone shipments to grow 4.2% in 2017 and 4.4% in 2018 with a 3.8% CAGR over the 2016-2021 time period.Shipments are forecast to reach 1.53 billion units in 2017 and grow to 1.77 billion in 2021. Gartner expects global mobile phone shipments to grow less than a point this year and 1.6% in 2018 with the ongoing migration from feature phones to basic smartphones, especially from Chinese players, continuing.As the personal stuff on them continues to increase, they start moving some of it to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) or Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) cloud, meaning that increasingly, personal information is moving on the network, from where it might be tampered with. According to the Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) Visual Networking Index, global mobile data traffic grew 63% in 2016, of which video traffic accounted for 60%. The Middle East grew 96%, Asia/Pacific 71%, Latin America 66%, Central and Eastern Europe 64%, Western Europe 52% and North America 44%.It forecasts global mobile data traffic increase of 7x between 2016 and 2021, representing a 47% CAGR with nearly three-quarters of all devices on the network being smart by the end of the period. The Middle East will grow strongest at a 65% CAGR, followed by Asia/Pac at 49% and Latin America at 45%. China traffic will outpace the U.S. this year.The digitization of banking services and online storage of healthcare information are two megatrends that also increase the risk of information loss. In fact, these two segments deal with critical information and are therefore under greater pressure from both regulators and customers to maintain a high level of security and privacy.The virtualization of corporate workloads and bring your own device (BYOD) megatrend will completely change security as we know it. That’s because hackers (ransomware) and other Internet crooks can’t make as much money from individuals as they can from companies, governments and government bodies.Moreover, organizations have more to lose than individuals in case of data breaches (i.e. data, reputation, business loss from incapacitation), so they are more concerned about protection. In fact, companies like Microsoft and Google have regular hackathons to identify weaknesses in the programs they develop. So hacking has become good money.Security Stocks That Should Be on Your RadarMobile security companies are still in their startup phase and it is the established players like Cisco, Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report), VMware, Microsoft, McAfee, Infineon and Dell that are gradually increasing investment in the area. Security pureplays like Check Point (CHKP  -  Free Report), Fortinet, F5 Networks (FFIV  -  Free Report), FireEye and Palo Alto are other stocks to watch.

Moreover, the company’s mobile and cloud security products are gradually gaining market acceptance. The storage and server management business provides recovery solutions and heterogeneous storage-end server platforms. We believe that these innovative products and solutions will help Symantec win customers, thus increasing its business volume.In an effort to recapture its momentum in the fast growing cybersecurity market, the company has resorted to acquisitions. Most recently, Symantec inked a deal to acquire Skycure, an Israel-based company. The buyout was aimed at providing security service against mobile threats and malwares across multiple devices like Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iOS, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows and Android.The company also inked a deal to acquire Fireglass, an Israel-based company, which helps organizations in protecting confidential information from any device by eliminating malware from web and email without any endpoint software. Last year, Symantec acquired Blue Coat, Inc., a leading web security solution provider, from private equity firm Bain Capital. Blue Coat’s security solutions allow organizations to protect their web gateways from cyber-attacks. Addition of Blue Coat is expected to enhance Symantec’s capabilities significantly.We believe that these acquisitions will enable the company to increase its scale of operations, gain customers and enhance its technological expertise.Moreover, investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are likely to boost Symantec’s long-term prospects. Additionally, restructuring initiatives and synergies from buyouts are expected to support the company’s bottom line.Stock to ConsiderAnother top-ranked stock in the broader technology includes Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.
