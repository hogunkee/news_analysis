0,PRU,"MetLife (MET), Allstate (ALL) and Prudential (PRU) topped quarterly earnings views late Wednesday. Host Hotels (HST) met EPS views.XThe results arrive as Allstate and Host Hotels and Prudential closed near buy points, while MetLife remains extended past a proper entry.Estimates: Wall Street expects the life-insurance giant to report third-quarter earnings per share of 90 cents, a 30% drop, with revenue falling 18% to $15.248 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.13, with total revenue at $16.1 billion. MetLife also OK'd a new $2 billion share buyback program.Stock: Shares were little changed late. MetLife closed up 0.5% to 53.87 in the stock market today. The stock is extended above a 50.64 buy point of a cup base.The company in August spun off Brighthouse Financial (BHF), which sold life insurance in the U.S., and said that it would likely take a charge of more than $1.1 billion related to the split.The move is part of MetLife's effort to shed riskier, higher-capital or underperforming businesses, but those attempts could hit short-term profits. Profits in the life-insurance industry have been hurt by low interest rates and weaker enrollment.Estimates: The company, also among the biggest life insurance providers in the U.S., is expected to report Q3 EPS up 2% to $2.71, on revenue of $12.240 billion, down 9%.Results: EPS is $3.01.Stock: Shares were little changed late. Prudential finished up 0.2% to 110.67, trading intraday above a 110.78 buy point of a handle in a cup base.Prudential this year said it plans to restructure its U.S. businesses, a move that it said was intended to seize longer-term opportunities for growth.Zacks analysts note that the insurer stands to benefit from a surge in demand for retirement-related products from baby boomers. Prudential, like MetLife, has also shown strength internationally.Estimates: The property-and-casualty insurer is seen reporting third-quarter EPS of $1.08, down 14%, as revenue slips 8% to $8.453 billion.Results: EPS unexpectedly rose to $1.60. Revenue was $9.66 billion.Stock: Shares were little changed late. Allstate finished the regular session up 0.4% to 94.25, near a 95.35 buy point of a flat base.The results come after speculation over the GOP's tax-cut plans and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which initially sank property and casualty insurers like Allstate, although investor fears eased later on. Barclays estimated that Allstate was among the firms that had the most to gain from the GOP's plans.Estimates: The high-end hotel real-estate investment trust is seen reporting an 11% drop in third-quarter funds from operation to 33 cents a share, as revenue dips 2% to $1.273 billion.Results: FFO was 33 cents. Revenue fell to $1.254 billion.Stock: Host Hotels was little changed late. Shares closed up 0.8% to 19.72. The stock is near a 20.31 buy point of a flat base. Aggressive investors could use 20.05 as an alternative entry.RELATED:Prudential Financial Shows Rising Relative Strength; Still Shy Of Key ThresholdTax Plan Could Put These 5 Insurers In Buy Zone: Investing Action PlanBanks And Financial Stock NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

4,PRU,"This year's mutual fund industry conference has a lot on its plate as presenters and attendees grapple with an investor rush to lower-cost products and the tectonic shift that's caused in asset management.Mutual fund portfolio managers, fund directors, compliance officers, industry operations specialists, lawyers, vendors and service providers from around the world will hash out the issues at the 59th annual General Membership Meeting (GMM) of the Investment Company Institute (ICI), happening May 3-5 at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, D.C.ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens expects this year's attendance to hit 1,300.James McNamara, president and CEO of Goldman Sachs Mutual Funds and this year's GMM chair, will deliver opening remarks.Retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, co-founder of the McChrystal Group, is scheduled to talk with Stevens about leadership and public policy priorities during a Wednesday session.Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric (GE), is slated to talk with Stevens about such issues as transformative technology in today's economy.The industry bubbles with competition between active and passive funds, between mutual funds and ETFs, with many fund complexes operating all types of funds. Stevens says the GMM is neutral ground where all approaches are welcome. ""We don't pick and choose winners,"" Stevens said in advance of the gathering. ""It's the market and investors who do that. And many public policy issues are the same for both types of funds.""Shundrawn Thomas, executive vice president and head of the funds and managed accounts group at Northern Trust Management, is due to moderate a panel titled ""Facing the Future: Fresh Perspectives."" Panel members will discuss priorities and concerns of the asset management industry. Scheduled panelists are Thomas Jones, head of strategic relations, intermediary distribution at Columbia Threadneedle Investments; Heather Lord, senior vice president, head of strategy and innovation for Capital Group; and Sean Tuffy, senior vice president, investment services at Brown Brothers Harriman.Before the conference, Thomas told IBD that he expects to ask panelists how fund firms — both mutual funds and ETFs — are dealing with the price compression brought on by the rise of ETFs. ""If you are a provider of predominantly actively managed mutual funds, what does that mean?"" he asked. ""Does it mean you have to expand your business model to offer more passive solutions? Or operate more efficiently and offer what you already do at a lower price?""Asked whether smaller firms, especially those that offer few, if any, passive mutual funds and ETFs, are in danger of being driven out of the marketplace, Thomas said, ""There will continue to be organizations, even if they are boutique-like, that deliver active (funds) well. Firms like that can continue to have success and even thrive against firms (whose products) have a less-clear focus and less-effective execution.""To me,"" he continued, ""it's about how much value you offer to clients, and how effectively you communicate with them. If you are middling in terms of ability to offer value and demonstrate it, I think those firms regardless of size will struggle in the foreseeable future.""Stuart Parker, president of Prudential Financial's (PRU) PGIM Investments, is scheduled to be moderator of ""The Future of Investment Advice"" panel, whose participants will discuss trends that could affect the delivery of investment advice.The panelist lineup is Eli Broverman, president and co-founder of robo-advisory firm Betterment; Kelly Coffey, CEO of J.P. Morgan Private Bank; and Ben Huneke, managing director and head of investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.Parker told IBD before the conference that, among many topics, he hopes to orchestrate a discussion of how his panelists' firms expect to use robo-advisors as well as active and passive strategies to address their clients' varied but sometimes overlapping needs.""We're looking to understand the whole convergence between technology-based and human advice,"" Parker said. ""I'm expecting to hear that there are more similarities than differences (among their market) segments in their strategies for providing advice to clients.""Technically, the GMM consists of four conferences. In addition to the general membership meeting, the ICI's operations and technology conference will convene. So will the mutual fund compliance program conference and the independent directors council's fund directors workshop.The GMM offers representatives of the mutual fund and ETF industry a chance to discuss current trends and issues affecting money managers. The three-day program includes panel discussions. It also features speeches, featuring industry leaders, business strategists, authors and political commentators. In total, the conference will consist of 33 panels and sessions, featuring 80 speakers.RELATED:Morningstar Packs Conference Lineup For Financial AdvisorsMutual Fund Stars Brainstorm At Morningstar Investment Conference

6,PRU,"The slump in bond prices following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election may moderate as investors scale back expectations of quick fixes to boost the economy, according to Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income.""You may see some settling back as you hit the speed bumps of reality and implementation,"" Tipp said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""The increase in long-term interest rates that would be due if the policy comes in very stimulative has been taken into account.""Bonds have fallen since Trump won the presidential election in November amid speculation that deregulation, lower taxes and increased infrastructure spending will stoke growth. PGIM, which oversees more than $1 trillion and is part of insurer Prudential Financial (PRU), is among investment managers pushing a long-term view as Trump's White House sends some signals that rattle markets and others that raise hopes of greater economic expansion.Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. who appeared alongside Tipp on Bloomberg TV, highlighted the resistance that Trump will face in implementing his plans. He said the new president is unlikely to enjoy the same rapport that Ronald Reagan, another Republican, had with Democratic lawmakers decades ago.""Reagan's relationship with Tip O'Neill, the Democratic speaker, was actually quite strong,"" Seiberg said Monday. ""I'm not sure we have the same type of relationships that we saw back then, and that's going to slow things down significantly.""Tipp said that investors should focus on ""big picture"" economic trends. He noted that yields on 10-year Treasuries have moved only about a basis point since Friday, even as Trump's clampdown on immigration sparked a global backlash.And while investors may need to temper their expectations for stimulus, securities prices suggest that one of the worst threats — a slump in global trade — isn't as likely as some had feared, according to Tipp. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has floated the idea of paying for a border wall with a 20% tax on Mexican imports.""Markets are smart,"" Tipp said. ""Markets have concluded, though, that there may be an example made of some countries more than others on the trade front, but that free trade is going to continue. And that this is not going to be cataclysmic, but we have to stay tuned.""

8,PRU,"Pay off debt, or save for retirement?Never has that quandary been more acute than it is right now for the younger members of today's workforce. Millennials are confronting often-crushing debt from student loans — more onerous than perhaps any other generation has faced — and trying to save for their eventual golden years.XDepending on the level of education, young professionals could be saddled with student loans totaling anywhere from $100,000 to as high as $400,000 for doctors and attorneys, financial planners say.""The level of student debt this generation is shouldering is unprecedented,"" said Jennifer Putney, vice president of participant engagement at Prudential Financial (PRU). ""It's huge.""Still, those starting to weave their way through their careers need to try to figure a way to set aside money for retirement. With concerns mounting that Social Security may not survive the latter half of this century, it's imperative that the nation's largest demographic somehow make provisions for life after those careers are over.And millennials are the first to admit it, Putney says.""Interestingly enough, it's very much on their minds,"" she said, almost as much as their student debt. ""They're going to have to figure out how to do both.""Dan McElwee, executive vice president for Ventura Wealth Management in Ewing, N.J., is a millennial himself, and at age 32 he's at the older end of that generation's spectrum. He says the debt burden makes many of his contemporaries wonder whether it's worth the effort to get the education.Those who go back to school to get an MBA, for instance, not only are adding as much as $100,000 in new debt, they may be missing out on $200,000 from two years of earnings. He says, though, that the schooling can be obtained and saving for retirement still can be done.""You have to look at it in different silos,"" he said. ""People tend to be overwhelmed by their debt numbers.""The key is to make a budget, McElwee said. Some will get ambitious about saving — putting in $100 to $200 a month — but then give up on it once they discover it's too much to set aside. McElwee says it's best to do a little of your own financial planning, and set aside a certain amount where you can keep contributing.Then take a look at other expenses, he said. Don't defer on those student loans too long, he cautions, and examine whether you're getting the best deal. It's possible to refinance student loans and make them more manageable.Adam Barringer, a certified financial planner at Charles Schwab (SCHW) in New York, is a millennial as well and says he isn't sure that student debt is the biggest burden that millennials face.Barringer, 28, tries to put it in context with the device most often associated with his generation: the cellphone. When buying a cellphone, you look for the best deals first, then you make the monthly payments on the phone and finally pick up whatever cool apps are available.In financial planning, it's best to find whatever deals are out there. With retirement plans such as 401(k)s, employers often match an employee's contribution. That's essentially free money for employees. With 401(k)s, you can contribute $18,000 a year and/or put $5,500 into an individual retirement account tax free.Then you can pay your bills — in this case your student debt and other financial obligations. Then spend the rest of your money on vacations and other expenses.""It's a simple process, and it's the same way we would approach it when buying a phone,"" he said.Colleen Jaconetti, senior investment strategist in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group, also says matching the 401(k) is essential, but saving whenever you can is helpful. Cutting $15 a day out of everyday expenses such as coffee, lunch out of the office, or happy hour will go a long way. Even if you can do that every other day, it helps.""Try to save as much as you can and invest in low-cost investments,"" she said.How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersP-s-s-s-t, Millennials! 5 Tips For Taming Your Student-Loan DebtHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)Top Jobs For Millennials: What They Are And Tips For Landing Them6 Ways To Maximize Your Productivity By Minimizing Distractions

10,PRU,"Wells Fargo (WFC) continued to see fewer account openings last month, as the banking giant continues to deal with questions about its sales practices following allegations this year that it opened up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts. However, the declines on a month-to-month basis have eased.Opened consumer checking accounts in November plunged 41% from a year ago, Wells Fargo said. But those openings were down only 9% from October. October new accounts tumbled 27% from September.Customer loyalty scores, meanwhile, were down from last year but ticked up a bit from October.""We know we have more work ahead of us and we remain focused on strengthening our relationships with existing customers and building new ones with potential customers,"" Mary Mack, Wells' head of community banking, said in a statement.Shares rose 0.3% to 55.34 in the stock market today. Like other banks, Wells Fargo got a postelection bump on the prospect of eased regulations, higher interest rates and a more favorable yield spread, but the stock had eased in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of fewer regulations under a Trump administration has sent bank stocks higher. Trump's announcement that he would focus on developing the nation's infrastructure has also lifted steel stocks. Wells Fargo in September settled with regulators over allegations that sales staff at its retail banking division — that is, its bank branches — for years opened accounts without consumers' knowledge or permission to hit sales goals in a high-pressure culture.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last month revoked some of the September settlement conditions, which will force Wells Fargo to get approval for major plans and senior employment changes. The bank said it had fired more than 5,000 employees in connection with the scandal, which in October forced the ouster of the bank's CEO, John Stumpf, who was brought before Congress and grilled over his knowledge of the sales tactics. The bank also faces federal and state investigations over its practices.Now, Prudential Financial (PRU) is looking into whether Wells Fargo staff also made similar account openings for Prudential's life insurance policies.Wells Fargo once again failed to provide a satisfactory ""living will,"" the Federal Reserve and FDIC said Tuesday. Banks are required to spell out how they would wind down their operations without destabilizing the financial system.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) amended their wills successfully, regulators said.JPMorgan Chase fell 1.2%, Bank of America 2.2% and Citigroup (C) 0.8%, though all three are near record or longtime highs.RELATED:Bank Stocks Push Dow Toward 20,000 After 1-Day Fed PauseWhy Bank Stocks Ended Mixed After Fed Turned More Aggressive On RatesBank Stocks Unfazed After Italy Referendum, Renzi Resignation

12,PRU,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base. Spectra Energy (SE), International Paper (IP) and Enbridge (ENB) are all four weeks into flat consolidations, which point to more possible bases maturing the week beginning October 17.Rising Optimism Among This Insurer's Clients Bode Well For Its StockCummins' Triple Threat: Dividend Growth, Cash Flow And Big Price GainsBank Stocks Have Work To Do, But Could Be Worth WatchingCisco Systems Spending $4 Billion In Mexico

15,PRU,"The Treasury Department is challenging a district court ruling that MetLife (MET) was no longer ""too big to fail"" and could make it more difficult for General Electric (GE) and AIG (AIG) to get their labels removed.Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a statement that he strongly disagrees with the ruling that would give MetLife ""even less oversight than before the financial crisis,"" and the Treasury released a statement saying that ""the government will appeal the district court’s decision.”In her ruling, District of Columbia federal judge Rosemary Collyer said that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) ""ignored"" or ""abandoned"" its responsibilities when it designated the insurer as a systemically important financial institution.Collyer's ruling was issued last week, but her reasoning was sealed until late Tuesday.MetLife shares closed down less than 0.1% in the stock market today.The government's appeal could put the breaks on GE and other companies' potential requests to have the designation removed.Last week, GE asked the FSOC  to end GE Capital’s “too big to fail”  designation after the MetLife ruling, saying it has cut risks by reducing assets and exiting U.S. consumer and leveraged lending.AIG's CEO Peter Hancock told CNBC last week that the MetLife ruling is an opportunity for AIG to also apply to get its label removed. Prudential Financial (PRU) has similarly said it might try to get its label removed.GE shares rose 0.5%. AIG shares edged up 0.1%. Prudential shares climbed 0.2%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

16,PRU,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

17,PRU,"Men may have long dominated the financial advisory field. But increasingly, signs show women are finally getting their shot.Amid a growing awareness of the “female market” for financial advice -- some data show women now controlling 51% of America’s personal wealth -- and the aftermath of some bias lawsuits, evidently more financial advisory firms are inviting women to be advisors as well as clients.“It’s a big deal,” said Michelle Lynch, vice president of Raymond James Financial’s (RJF) Network for Women Advisors. She added, “All the firms have some initiative now around women.”To be sure, female advisors are still comparatively few. Although women comprise more than half the population, they account for only 31% of financial advisors and 23% of certified financial planners (CFPs), according to a 2014 CFP Board report. And experts say that many women still aren’t even aware of the profession.But these days, programs in colleges, professional groups and company recruitment aim to boost the ranks of women advisors. Indeed, at Prudential Advisors, “our goal is to reflect the marketplace,” said Catalina Camoscio, the firm’s vice president of recruiting and development. Reflecting the marketplace would eventually mean “50% of (our) advisors” would be women.At big advisory firms, strategies to attract women -- often part of a firm’s broader “diversity” initiatives -- can include mentoring programs, college recruitment, hiring women returning to work after an extended leave, and the use of team advising.An example of the latter: A year and a half ago, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management (MLWM) expanded its training and development lineup with a Team Financial Advisor (TFA) offering. Participants take on one of five specific roles within an existing advisory team and receive 31 months of training.TFA recruits might include those starting a second career or new college graduates. Among TFA's attractions for women: It allows them “to work collaboratively with other advisors while contributing their expertise to the group,” said Linda Houston, division executive for New England at MLWM.Apprenticeships appear to be among the draws at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (MSWM). For a year, apprentices work with a team of wealth advisors to broaden their skills before starting their own advisory practice within Morgan Stanley (MS). Results so far: about half the apprenticeship program’s hires have been women, reports Kara Underwood, MSWM’s head of diversity. (Morgan Stanley did not provide specific numbers of hires.)This year, Prudential (PRU) hopes to launch its team approach to financial advising and include recruitment as part of it. While this initiative could involve anyone, “we expect it to attract women because of the mentorship and collaboration it offers,” Prudential's Camoscio said.So how can women learn of, and tap, such opportunities? Experts cite key steps to consider:
"
18,PRU,"MetLife (MET) beat back a U.S. attempt to label it too big to fail, which would’ve put America’s biggest life insurer under tougher government scrutiny and could have forced it to put more money in reserves.A federal judge in Washington struck down the designation on Wednesday in a decision that could shake up the financial regulatory reform implemented following the 2008 recession. The ruling might give ammunition to Republican lawmakers who’ve argued that regulators have abused their authority under the Dodd-Frank Act.“One of the centerpieces of the Dodd-Frank Act has been called into question,” Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading in Washington, said in a phone interview. “Depending on what the court’s reasoning was, I think it’s fair to believe that there could be a more aggressive push to curtail the FSOC’s authority in the next Congress depending on the election outcome in November.”U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer rejected the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s rationale for classifying MetLife as a systemically important financial institution. The reasons for the ruling were sealed by the judge, although she did offer a glimpse of her rationale, siding with MetLife that the designation didn’t take into account the economic effect on the insurer.The ruling undercuts the foundation of the Obama administration’s plan to more heavily regulate four nonbank businesses that were determined to have the potential to destabilize the American financial system. MetLife had called the designation arbitrary and unjustified. Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian said earlier this year that his New York-based company will shed much of its domestic retail business because SIFI put it at a “significant competitive disadvantage.”MetLife shares were up more than 5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Prudential Financial (PRU), which is the second-largest U.S. life insurer and was also named a non-bank SIFI, rallied near 2%.After a rigorous analysis, the FSOC “determined that material financial distress at MetLife could pose a threat to the financial system,” U.S. Treasury spokesman Adam Hodge said in an emailed statement. “We firmly believe that FSOC acted well within its legal authority to protect the entire global economy.”MetLife's lawyers argued that the council failed to assess MetLife’s vulnerabilities to financial distress and that it failed to consider the economic effects of the designation on the company. The judge ruled in MetLife’s favor on those points.Filed last year, the MetLife suit was the biggest challenge yet to the council that includes Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.Other nonbanks bearing its SIFI designation are AIG (AIG) and Prudential, neither of which have brought challenges. General Electric (GE) has agreed to sell more than $160 billion of assets since April under a plan to shed the bulk of its GE Capital finance operations. GE has said it intends to submit an application to regulators this quarter to drop the label.In January, Kandarian announced that MetLife plans to pursue a spinoff, sale or public offering of much of its U.S. retail business, which sells variable annuities and life insurance policies and could be subjected to higher capital rules although they’ve not yet been finalized.While the insurer hasn’t outlined a precise plan, it struck a deal in February to sell a distribution network with 4,000 financial advisors to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.

19,PRU,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

22,PRU,"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's crusade against the financial-services industry has won her plenty of enemies on Wall Street but at least one strange bedfellow in multi-millionaire hedge-fund manager Michael Masters.
"
23,PRU,"Masters is the money behind Better Markets, a D.C. non-profit pushing for stricter financial regulations and advocating the break-up of big banks. This year, the group testified before and filed legal briefs in support of designating MetLife (MET) and Prudential Financial (PRU) as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, which could expose the companies to much more stringent and costly oversight.At the same time, reports Brendan Bordelon of the National Review, Masters' hedge fund held millions in call options on the insurers. Likewise, Better Markets has been backing Warren's push for a reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, forcing the separation of commercial banks from investment banks, while Masters held call options on Citigroup (C). While there's no smoking gun that Masters was short-selling the stocks at the same time as Better Markets was pushing more stringent capital rules for the companies, Bordelon notes that the call options would have made sense as a hedge against a rise in the price of a stock being shorted.At the least, Better Markets should have disclosed that its primary benefactor had a financial stake in the policies it was advocating. Jill Sommers, a former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, tells Bordelon that Better Markets' conflict of interest is ""huge"" and ""unprecedented"" in the world of think-tank advocacy.Warren pushed Brookings economist outThe disclosure of this conflict at the heart of the mission of Warren's favorite think tank is particularly problematic for the Massachusetts firebrand because it comes just after she intervened to get Brookings Institution economist Robert Litan pushed out on a seemingly baseless charge that he failed to sufficiently disclose a financial conflict of interest.In testifying to Congress in opposition to a Department of Labor fiduciary rule backed by Warren, Litan cited a study he was paid to conduct by a mutual-fund asset manager, which he did in fact disclose on the first page of the study and in his testimony. Brookings said Litan left after Warren's critical letter only because he made one brief mention of his link with Brookings in listing his credentials in the published version of his testimony.The message to the academic community from Litan's departure was loud and clear: ""If you are an academic who challenges data supporting (Warren's) ideas, you stand to put your job at risk,"" a financial-services industry official told The Hill.Bordelon's piece is titled ""Elizabeth Warren's Wall Street Double Standard,"" but that seems unfair — to Litan. There seems to be only one standard: Are you with her or against her?Warren's working assumptions are that anyone who accepts money from the financial services industry to conduct a study must be morally compromised, and the study can't be trusted. Yet the general conclusion reached by Litan — President Obama's and Warren's favored fiduciary rule would end up depriving working-class households of retirement advice — has also been reached by a majority of House Democrats.As The Hill reported, 96 Democrats recently signed a letter ""calling on Department of Labor officials and Obama to significantly change the proposal, citing concerns that it would end up raising financial-advice costs on low- and moderate-income Americans.""Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

The banking giant will let shareholders that own at least 3% of BofA shares for at least three years nominate directors. Up to 20 such investors can pool their stakes together to reach 3%.BofA had rejected similar proposals in the prior two year, but proxy access is growing increasingly popular. General Electric (GE), Prudential Financial (PRU) and Citigroup (C) also have backed proxy access this year, with the same standard of a 3% stake of up to 20 investors holding for at least three years.GE and Prudential, like Bank of America, have amended their bylaws. Citigroup has endorsed a shareholder amendment.Whole Foods Market (WFM) has resisted adopting a similar 3%/20 investors/3-years ""proxy access"" amendment. Instead, the upscale grocery chain favored a much-higher standard for the right to nominate directors: a 9% stake by investors holding shares for at least five years.Whole Foods tried to get the SEC to exclude the 3% proxy access amendment from a shareholder vote, citing the conflict with its own plan. But the SEC said it would stay out, leaving the 3% amendment back on the table. Whole Foods has pushed back its annual shareholder meeting to Sept. 15 after previously planning to hold it on March 10.Bank of America may now face renewed pressure from pension funds over its decision to give the chairman's role to CEO Brian Moynihan, despite a 2009 shareholder vote to keep the posts separate.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

43,PRU,"James Walter Thompson was the original Mad Man.Way back in 1878 he founded the J. Walter Thompson Co. advertising firm — referred to in the industry as JWT — and began pioneering techniques such as national branding campaigns and using scientific information to back product claims.""He was a tall, handsome man, whose blue eyes, trim brown beard and naval exploits in the Civil War earned him the nickname the Commodore,"" Mark Tungate, author of ""Adland: A Global History of Advertising,"" told IBD. ""He understood the value of charming, serving and keeping clients, creating the role of the account executive.""Thus was born the first full-service ad agency and Madison Avenue — hence the future ""Mad Men"" TV show — as shorthand for the marketing industry that is clustered on that New York boulevard.Today, JWT Worldwide is one of the largest brand communications firms in the world, with 10,000 employees in 200 offices, and is part of WPP (WPPGY), whose stock has sprinted 400% since 2008.Young At WarThompson (1847-1928) was born in Pittsfield, Mass., and grew up in Ohio. At 16, he signed up for the Navy toward the end of the Civil War and served on the sloop-of-war Saratoga, which protected Union ships off Delaware and blockaded the Carolinas.After the war, Thompson headed for New York, where his passion for sailing would lead him to be elected president of the city's Yacht Club. By 1868 he was the bookkeeper for Smith & Carlton, which specialized in placing newspaper ads.Thompson soon found that he had a talent for selling ads and could make a lot more money that way. But he noticed that few magazines ran them because many people saw advertising as a disreputable business for hucksters promoting patent medicine.""These were medicines that were essentially trademarks for specific products that local merchants would advertise,"" wrote Charles Goodrum and Helen Dalrymple in ""Advertising in America."" ""Other than these and sugar, coffee and liquor, very little was made at a distance and shipped to the market because moving and storage was extraordinarily difficult. Patent medicine advertising provided one-third of all profits made by the American press by the end of the 1800s.""So Thompson was ahead of the game. ""He was among the first to recognize the potential of a new medium, the glossy magazine,"" said Tungate. ""I was struck by how modern his approach was.""Thompson argued that an agency that understood a magazine's readers would match them with the right ads. He plugged away and obtained exclusive rights to place ads in 30 major publications (eventually 100), launching the first national magazine campaigns, according to George Haley, director of the Center for International Industry Competitiveness at the University of New Haven, in Connecticut.Thompson's lesson is that tough goals combined with perseverance can lead to great achievements.In 1878, Thompson bought the agency for $500 and the furniture for $800 — a total equivalent to $31,000 today — and changed the name. Among his innovations over the next few decades:• Rather than simply place ads, he offered artistically and psychologically sophisticated designs and themes for entire campaigns.• He hired artists and writers to bring a fresh look to ads and product packaging. Among those who worked at JWT: singer David Bowie and novelists Stephen King and James Patterson.• He put ads on magazines' back covers, which had been blank.• He promoted the idea of dividing one ad page into quarters to lower costs for small companies.• He saw that women were the primary spenders of household income and targeted them.• He produced a directory of newspapers and magazines with information on circulation and ad rates.Early on he knew that many business leaders didn't get the value of advertising. So he took out ads in trade magazines to point out the value of ad copy based on understanding consumers, says Haley.By now Thompson was letting the industry in on the importance of branding and trademarks for selling to consumers.A reflection of that was his creation of the Rock of Gibraltar symbol for Prudential Insurance (PRU), accompanied by the slogan ""The Strength of Gibraltar.""In 1902, Thompson began working with Unilever (UL) — still a JWT client today, making it the longest client-agency relationship in marketing history. Other food firms that leapt on board were Cream of Wheat, Libby's and Swift & Co.Thompson was adept at drawing top copywriters, including Stanley Resor and Helen Lansdowne.Way With WordsResor's ads emphasized ""the reason why"" consumers should buy something. Lansdowne pioneered the use of medical information in ads to convince readers that a soap or cosmetic would help them.""She was responsible for a famous Woodbury's Soap ad in 1911, which was among the first to use sex appeal with the phrase 'the skin that you love to touch' and a picture of a romantic couple,"" wrote Edd Applegate in ""The Rise of Advertising in the United States."" ""It increased sales by 1,000% in eight years, and Thompson made her the first female creative director in an industry dominated by men.""In 1912, Thompson and Resor set up a department to research marketing issues, such as a report on retailing statistics in America.They also developed the Thompson T-Squared formula for designing campaigns, which asked: What is the product and to whom, where, when and how are we selling it?By 1916, Thompson had built the world's largest ad agency, with 300 clients and 177 employees in five offices, including London. That move to England in 1899 made his the first U.S. agency to expand internationally, wrote Applegate.Annual billings were $3 million — worth $65 million now — and Thompson saw more growth as unmanageable. So at 69 he retired.Rich DealHe sold the agency to Resor and two partners for $500,000, worth $10.8 million now. Resor married Lansdowne the next year and served as president until 1955.The power couple would have a huge impact on modern advertising, with Lansdowne becoming a role model for Peggy in ""Mad Men,"" according to Tungate.""Perhaps Thompson's greatest legacy was recognizing the talents of Resor and Lansdowne,"" said Karen Mishra, professor of marketing at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. ""The culture Thompson created encouraged innovation by his employees for decades, including testing different copy for its efficacy before rolling out a campaign and the use of celebrity testimonials.""Thompson, who died at 80, had a final lesson: Cultivate top subordinates who can build on your legacy.JWT would become legendary for its iconic campaigns, such as:• 7Up's ""Uncola.""• De Beers' ""A Diamond Is Forever.""• ""The Few. The Proud. The Marines.""""J. Walter Thompson was singularly instrumental in the development of the advertising trade and the professionalism of the field,"" said Joshua Rowley, reference archivist at the Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History at Duke University, which has the JWT archives. ""His work took the industry from the fringes of the market economy to a respectable profession, persuading businesses to see advertising as a core and crucial business expense.""

60,PRU,"Estimates for Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) have been revised upward over the past 60 days, buoying analysts’ optimism on the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 0.7% and 0.3% to $4.52 and $5, respectively.As a provider of life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds and investment management products and services, Prudential boasts a rich history of 140 years of operations. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) financial services leader have soared nearly 46.4%, outperforming the industry's surge of 38.6% over the last couple of years.  Let’s focus on the factors that make Prudential a wealthy choice for fetching fat returns to investors’ portfolio.Pension risk transfer business poised for growth: Prudential’s Retirement segment is set to benefit from the company’s penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Appetite for risk of pension plan sponsors have off late increased, given a low interest rate, greater accounting and regulatory changes and larger-than-expected funding contributions. There has been a worldwide escalation in pension de-risking demand with the United Kingdom emerging as the leading market.Rising demand for retirement benefits’ products: As baby boomers approach the age of retirement, Prudential should witness huge demand for products that benefit the silver years. About one-fourth of the population will turn 65 or older by 2050. Also, Asian markets including Korea and Taiwan, each of which also has a grey populace is showing keen interest in retirement-oriented products. The company should enjoy a competitive edge on the back of Prudential’s vast distribution network, a superior brand image and time-tested presence.Growing international business: Prudential is expanding its global foothold, mainly in Japan, Korea and China, vital for long-term growth. The company’s Brazilian business has gained a sufficient scale and should become an important contributor to its earnings growth in the overseas division over the next few years. Further, business growth in Malaysia, an attractive market with low life insurance penetration, a well-developed regulatory environment and a long-term growth potential, must boost the company’s foreign operational activities.Effective Capital Deployment: Banking on robust, sustainable cash generation, Prudential envisions a free cash flow ratio of about 65% of adjusted operating income on average over time. The insurer’s annualized dividend has nearly doubled over the last five years and currently yields 3.65%, better than the industry average of 2.49%. It also has $1.5 billion under share buyback authorization for 2018. All these collectively make Prudential a lucrative pick for yield-seeking investors.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $12.15, representing a year-over-year increase of 14.8% while for 2019, the consensus mark stands at $12.82, translating into a 5.6% year-over-year rise.Prudential has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company shows a decent earnings surprise history, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last three quarters with an average beat of 5.85%.Attractive Valuation: Shares are trading at a price to book multiple of 0.8, lower than the industry average of 1.31.  Price to book is the best multiple to value insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps finding stocks that are undervalued. This deviation from their fair value is what creates an exceptional upside opportunity. Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable Value Score Score of A or B coupled with a bullish Zacks Rank offer the best investment bets.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the insurance industry may also consider other top-ranked stocks like Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report), Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report).  Kemper provides property and casualty as well as life and health insurance to individuals and businesses in the United States. It pulled off an average four-quarter positive surprise of 121.61%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Assurant provides risk management solutions for housing and lifestyle markets in North America, Latin America, Europe and the Asia Pacific.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 2.Cigna provides insurance and related products and services in the United States and internationally. The company delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 15.74%.

61,PRU,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PRU due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Prudential (PRU  -  Free Report) Q1 Earnings Top, Revenues Miss EstimatesPrudential Financial, Inc.’s  first-quarter 2018 adjusted net income of $3.08 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.99 by 3%. The bottom line also improved 10.4% year over year.Improved performances at Investment Management Division and International Insurance aided the above upside.Behind the HeadlinesTotal revenues rose 7.2% year over year to $12.9 billion on the back of 15% growth in premiums and a 1.3% increase in policy charges and fee income, partially offset by 0.5% lower net investment income. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.9%.Total benefits and expenses of nearly $11.2 billion increased 7.8% year over year in the quarter under review. This increase in expenses is mainly attributable to higher insurance and annuity benefits, interest expense, amortization of acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses.Quarterly Segment UpdateTotal U.S. Individual Solutions reported adjusted operating income of $555 million, down 5.3% year over year. This downside was attributable to a nearly 67% drop in contribution from Individual Life.Total U.S. Workplace Solutions adjusted operating income was $375 million, down 13.7% from the year-ago quarter, attributable to lower contribution from Retirement.Total Investment Management Division adjusted operating income improved 18.4% to $232 million, driven by higher asset management fees.Total International Insurance reported adjusted operating income of $856 million, up 7.1% year over year, driven by higher contribution from Life Planner and Gibraltar Life and Other operations.Corporate and Other Operations reported adjusted operating loss of $294 million, narrower than the loss of $352 million in the year-ago quarter.Financial UpdateCash and cash equivalents of $15.7 billion at first-quarter end increased 17.8% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2018, Prudential Financial’s assets under management increased 6.9% to $1.4 trillion year over year. Adjusted book value, a measure of the company’s net worth, was $93.55 per share as of Mar 31, 2018, up 15.3% year over year.Operating return on average equity was 13.7%, having contracted 40 basis points year over year.Debt balance totaled $15.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $18.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus  Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PRU has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Interestingly, PRU has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

62,PRU,"Last week, Barclays (BCS  -  Free Report) acquired £4.3 billion ($5.8 billion) worth of Irish residential mortgage loans from Lloyds Banking Group (LYG  -  Free Report). The portfolio comprises around 27,000 mortgages, originated between 2004 and 2010. Of the total loans acquired, nearly £300 million are impaired.Mortgage loan portfolio incurred a pre-tax loss of roughly £40 million in 2017. Notably, Lloyds is expected to record £110 million in pre-tax loss on the deal in second-quarter 2018.So, why has Barclays purchased this loan portfolio? The bank is definitely not interested in entering Irish mortgage market.Well, given the growing demand for securitized mortgage deals, Barclays plans to package and sell these Irish loans over the next two months. The group of investors that has shown interest in buying residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) includes M&G Investments, the investment management division of British insurer Prudential Plc (PRU  -  Free Report) and Pacific Investment Management Co. (“PIMCO”).Though the deal looks similar to the repackaging of home loans for resale to investors that was one of the primary reasons for the 2008 financial crisis, certain changes in the regulations as to how such deals are to be formed and sold means that these are expected to be less risky.Under the new rules, Barclays will be required to retain at least 5% of the Lloyds’ mortgages. This will align with the bank’s interest in the deal similar to other investors.Additionally, the securitization deal is not expected to hurt Barclays’ capital in the long term.This agreement comes at the heels of another one announced last month. Barclays, along with other investors had purchased £5.3 billion worth of residential mortgages from the British ‘bad bank.’ PIMCO funded the deal, with Barclays and five other banks planning to buy RMBS to help finance the acquisition.As European banks intend to focus on their core operations and shrink balance sheet with an aim to comply with stringent capital rules, such deals are likely to continue.Shares of Barclays have rallied 4.5% so far this year against 6.3% decline for the industry.Barclays, currently, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked foreign bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.’s (MUFG  -  Free Report) fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to grow 4.2% year over year. Also, the company shares have gained 3.7% in the past year. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

63,PRU,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) aims to expand its presence in the pension risk transfer market via agreement on the two largest plan termination transactions of 2017.These transactions, entered into by American General Life Insurance Company, part of AIG’s Life & Retirement business, represented over $1.5 billion in pension plan obligations covering more than 24,000 retirees, beneficiaries, deferred and active members.Tax reform, repatriation of assets from international operations and improved funded status provides significant opportunity for expansion of the pension risk transfer market.The company is one of the leaders in the thriving pension risk transfer market given its investment expertise, strong operational capabilities, prudent risk management, disciplined pricing and strong balance sheet.Pension risk transfer is in demand as corporations are de-risking their pension liabilities in order to lower risk profile and focus on their core business.Pension obligations pose threats to the company’s equity capital in the event of market disruption. Unfunded pension liabilities are a form of corporate debt, which has to be settled before paying to equity shareholders. Any loss in pension fund causes would inflate the pension fund liability which would erode shareholder’s equity and weigh on capital levels.These risks have increased the popularity of pension risk transfer agreements which enable corporations to delegate the management of their pension liabilities to an insurer for some fees These agreements thus enable companies to focus on their business growth without worrying about pension liability.Other big insurers Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) are also eying this growing market. Earlier this month, a unit of MetLife agreed to assume responsibility for about $6 billion in defined benefit pension obligations for 41,000 retirees and beneficiaries in FedEx pension plans.Also, a unit of Prudential Financial agreed to assume responsibility for about $1.2 billion in pension obligations to 7,500 pensioners from Pension Insurance Corp. PLC of the United Kingdom.American International revenues have suffered over the years from declining premium due to disciplined underwriting, competitive market conditions and reduction in business due to numerous divestitures taken.This is evident from declining revenues since 2013 that continued in the first quarter of 2018. Challenges in the property and casualty market, and continued business dispositions will continue to keep the top-line under pressure in the coming quarters.The stock has declined 15% in a year’s time compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5%.The company’s new CEO Brian Duperreault is expected to be instrumental in turning around the company by completing ongoing restructuring initiatives and making additional changes.American International Group carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better-ranked stock in the space is Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report). The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 121.6%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

64,PRU,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed halfway mark with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 73.8%, outperforming on the top-line front, thereby bearing evidence to a solid start. Combining the reported results with estimates for the yet-to-release companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 22.6% from the same period last year, driven by 8.4% growth in revenues.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 26.4% on 5.7% higher revenues.An important constituent of the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have driven solid net investment income, a chief component of an insurer’s top line. Though the metric is far from achieving a historical high, it nonetheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a flourishing economy and has expressed intention to raise the same twice more this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have curbed their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to take advantage of the increasing rates as investment yield betters.The first quarter is likely to gain an edge from the tax cut.  Per the new tax law effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been decreased to 21% from 35%. This lowering of the rate has added an impetus to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter stumbled upon a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the company’s underwriting profitability might still be left unscathed despite the cat events. Insurers having already suffered the hazards of weather-related loss in 2017, should have managed to make up for the underperformances in the first quarter of 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst projects global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability also seems slightly burdened.However, improved pricing, intelligent underwriting practices, portfolio restructuring as well as taking recourse to reinsurance covers might have shielded insurers to overcome the deficits.A varied product portfolio, global growth and tactical M&A activity are expected to have boosted insurers’ operations in the impending quarterly release.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) are set to report quarterly results this week. Let’s see how things shape up for a few good insurers below before their earnings announcement on May 2.American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is expected to witness flat to a slight decline in revenues due to its ongoing efforts in managing the overall business portfolio via reinsurance and divestitures. Low tax rate and share buyback should boost bottom line. Premiums and deposits at Life Insurance business are expected to increase led by strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales. However, in General Insurance business, premiums are expected to decline due to the company’s remediation of underperforming lines and divestitures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter highlights an 8.8% year-over-year fall. AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Although its Earnings ESP of +1.78% makes us confident about an earnings surprise, the stock’s bearish Zacks Rank leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

We expect an increase in total Life Insurance sales in the first quarter from higher Executive Benefit sales and gains in Variable Universal Life and term products combined with a consistently high demand for MoneyGuard. Tax reform will likely expand Lincoln National’s margin. Its balance sheet strength and a sturdy capital inflow are also part of the estimate.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.94 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, inching up 1% year over year.

As a big investor in the U.S. fixed income market, MetLife should have benefited from economic growth, leading to higher interest rates. However, earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions should be pressured by the flatter yield curve.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share for the last completed quarter translates into a 19.9% year-over-year decline. MetLife carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, its Earnings ESP of -0.06% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive as the company also needs a positive ESP to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

(PRU  -  Free Report) is expected to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to recurring premium sales, expanded product offerings, broader distribution capabilities and share buybacks. Core performance of its businesses is mainly fueled by higher fees in its Annuities and Investment Management segments as well as sustained business growth in International Insurance. However, increase in expenses, mainly due to higher insurance and annuity benefits plus general and administrative expenses, is likely to have weighed on the desired margin expansion.The consensus mark of $2.99 per share for the last completed quarter represents a 7.2% year-over-year rise. Prudential’s weak Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction unlikely.

67,PRU,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now.Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry OverviewThe insurance industry as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017 reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of quarterly releases on Feb 7.Stocks to ConsiderThe Allstate Corporation’s (ALL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by catastrophe loss, stemming from the California wildfires. This will not only put a dent in the company’s underwriting performance but also render volatility to the company’s bottom line. Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer expects to incur a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires.Nonetheless, the results are anticipated to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Further, on the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is likely to have witnessed investment income growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.57 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 27.6% year-over-year decline. Allstate carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with an Earnings ESP of -8.28% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read More: Will California Wildfires Hurt Allstate Q4 Earnings?)Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s (CINF  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results might take a beating by the occurrence of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires during the period to be reported. This might also affect the underwriting profitability and leave an impact on the combined ratio.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected a loss of not less than $1 million in each of the aforementioned catastrophe events.Nonetheless, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives might have contributed to the possible upside.On the back of a progressing interest rate environment, the company’s net investment income is predicted to have significantly increased in the quarter to be soon reported. Also, investment results probably have risen on both higher interest and dividend income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 86 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter represents a 14.7% year-over-year improvement. Cincinnati Financial holds a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, when combined with an Earnings ESP of -2.92%, surprise prediction is left inconclusive. For a company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Cincinnati Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cincinnati Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cincinnati Financial Corporation QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.(Read More: Will Cat Loss Ail Cincinnati Financial’s Q4 Earnings?)Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) is likely to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to expanded product offerings and broader distribution capabilities. To top it all, share buyback is expected to have added to the bottom-line upside.Moreover, the company might experience favorable results at its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management segment, driven by its penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Additionally, on the back of higher Asset Management fees, the company might have witnessed growth in asset under management (AUM) in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company has possibly benefitted from a gradually improving interest rate environment, favoring investment income from higher invested asset balances.However, rise in expenses is likely to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall performance in turn.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s bottom line is pegged at $2.60 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 5.7% year over year.  Prudential Financial has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a favorable Zacks Rank of 2.

As a result, Torchmark’s total premium might have increased, riding on a favorable performance at both its Life Insurance and Health segments.On the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is anticipated to have reported higher excess investment income in the quarter yet to be reported.However, higher administrative expenses have been forecast to weigh on the insurance underwriting income in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.23 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 6% year over year. Torchmark has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and the company is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. Such an ideal combination of the two key ingredients makes us confident of an earnings beat.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PRU, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.87% heading into earnings season.Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period is pegged at $2.60 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.7%. To top it all, share buyback is expected to have added to the bottom-line upside.Moreover, the company might experience favorable results at its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management segment, owing to its penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating profit is pegged at $985 million, representing a 2.2% increase year over year.Also, the Multi line insurer’s international businesses are anticipated to have displayed a better-than-expected performance with its Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses likely registering stable core growth and good underwriting margins.Riding on higher Asset Management fees, the company might have witnessed Asset Under Management (AUM) growth in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the company is projected to benefit from a gradually improving interest rate environment, favoring investment income from higher invested asset balances.However, increase in expenses has likely weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall performance in turn.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to outshine estimates this time around are as follows:CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 12.

70,PRU,"eHealth, Inc. (EHTH  -  Free Report) has announced its preliminary results for the fourth quarter and 2017. The company expects to incur loss for both the time periods. Shares of the company lost about 0.34% at the trading session on Jan 16.eHealth projects net loss between $22.5 million and $23.5 million for the fourth quarter on revenues of $39 million to $40 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be negative, in the range of $18.3 million to $19.3 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate loss is pegged at $1.24 on revenues of $37.5 million. Both the bottom and top line translate into a year over year decrease of 57% and 14% respectively. Revenues fell shy of the company’s expectations.For the full year, eHealth tightened the revenue guidance to a range of $172.5 to $173.5 million from $165 to $175 million guided earlier.  Net loss is expected to be in the range of $27 million to $28 million compared with prior guidance of loss of $27.8 million to $28.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be negative, in the range of $14.5 million to $15.5 million. The company earlier projected Adjusted EBITDA to be negative, in the range of $14.1 million to $16.1 millionOn its third-quarter earnings call, the company stated that as the fourth quarter is considered a primary selling season, it expects improvement in Medicare submitted application. The company noted that the submitted applications for all its Medicare products grew 16% year over year in the fourth quarter. For 2017, the same increased 10% year over year, falling shy of the management’s expectation of growth in high-teens, attributable to slower-than-expected roll-out of selected partner relationships relative to plan.The company noted that submitted applications for individual and family plan products declined 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while for 2017, the same decreased 51% year over year. This downside was attributable to the challenging individual and family market during the Open Enrollment Period of the fourth quarter.Shares of eHealth have outperformed the industry in a year.  While the stock has surged 42.4%, the industry has rallied 17.3%. However, the company has not witnessed any earnings momentum for 2018 estimates. Also, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise only in one of the last three reported quarters.  eHealth is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Mar 1. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat estimates. This is because a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP, combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we always need a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank to be confident about an earnings surprise.eHealth focuses on shifting business mix toward a higher percentage of long-term value. Its Medicare customers will ensure a better future cash-flow generation and will position the company well for long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Brown & Brown Inc.

76,PRU,"Aon plc’s (AON  -  Free Report) robust inorganic growth has boosted its foothold in the insurance brokerage market. The company’s acquisitions mainly aim at expanding the health and benefits business as well as risk and insurance solutions operations. Strategic alliances have also bolstered Aon’s scale of business. The acquisition of Admix and the international benefit brokerage portfolio of the Mayfair group are worth a mention here. In September 2017, the company enhanced its investment capabilities with the buyout of The Townsend Group. These initiatives have significantly paved the way for Aon’s long-term growth.The company’s financial health impresses. Consistent generation of operating cash flow has enabled Aon to deploy capital in an effective manner. Also, it has been enhancing shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share repurchases. Year to date, the company’s shares have gained 24%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 21%. This reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock. Along with adding businesses, the company continues to divest non-core operations to streamline its core operations. The sale of its benefits administration and HR BPO platform to Blackstone Group in the first half of 2017 not only reduced its non-core expenses but also generated higher return on equity.Aon’s strong expense management program is impressive. Its operating expenses started declining since 2015. The divestment of non-core HR business is likely to reduce Aon’s overall costs in the coming quarters, in turn, propelling bottom-line growth.However, the company’s operations suffer from a high debt level. Consequently, interest expenses started rising since 2013. This is expected to weigh on Aon’s profitability.Moreover, Aon’s world-wide operations have been facing unfavorable impact of foreign exchange volatility on its earnings per share and revenues since 2012. This may lead to earnings volatility, in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAon presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in stocks from the insurance space can check out Radian Group Inc.

77,PRU,"Assurant inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions lately. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised substantially 44.9% downward. For 2018, the consensus mark moved 2.4% south.  Shares of Assurant have also underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 9.5%, lagging the industry’s growth of 10.3% during the period. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of D. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.Assurant has been witnessing lower net earned premiums and other considerations over the last few years and the first three quarters of 2017 were no exception. Each quarter experienced a year-over-year decline in the same. This continues to further weigh on total revenues that have been decreasing for a while now. Assurant’s In-force policies have also been trending downward over the last several years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom-line in 2017 represent a year-over-year decline of 17.3% and 8.8%, respectively.Though the third quarter was rampaged by a series of cat events, the fourth has till date only suffered the brunt of California wildfires. Assurant estimates fourth-quarter pre-tax reportable catastrophe loss from the same between $6 million and $8 million. The company incurred a huge cat loss in the previous quarter, wherein Global Housing segment was affected the most.The above segment is estimated to be weighed on by lower mortgage originations, decrease in real estate-owned volumes and declining placement rates. Total revenues have declined nearly 19% over the last couple of years.For 2017, the company expects Global Housing’s net earned premiums and net operating income to decrease due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business, which represents lower placement rates for the second half of 2017 plus lower contributions from mortgage solutions.Assurant’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over the last few years.Return on equity (ROE) undermines a company’s growth potential. Assurant’s trailing 12-month ROE of 3.6% compares unfavorably with the ROE of 7% for the industry, reflecting that it is inefficient in using shareholder funds.Choosing the StocksWhile Assurant doesn’t appear to be an attractive pick right now, there are a few other solid stocks in the insurance space that promise greater returns. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have boiled down to three favorable stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.

78,PRU,"As a property and casualty (P&C) insurer, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI  -  Free Report) is exposed to both natural and man-made catastrophe events. The company has been incurring inclement weather-related losses over a considerable period of time. In the first nine months of 2017 catastrophe loss amounted to $103.3 million, mainly stemming from the hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and two major earthquakes in Mexico. Given the unpredictable nature of such calamities, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) P&C insurer might experience catastrophe loss in the near term as well.It is important to note that being a P&C insurer, AmTrust Financial cannot avoid the aftermath of such catastrophe events, which in turn pose a threat to weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability. Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-oriented disasters inevitably makes its earnings volatile.This apart, the company has been experiencing escalating expenses, primarily due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, interest expenses, acquisition and other underwriting expenses. This in turn will restrict the operating margin expansion, thereby hampering the company’s overall results and limiting its growth.Moreover, high level of debt has led to an increase in interest burden, which in turn has weighed on the margin expansion.Southbound Estimates: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 32.3% downward over the last 60 days. While the same for 2018 has declined nearly 21.5% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank as well.An Underperformer: Shares of AmTrust Financial have plunged 66.2% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 11.7% rally. We also apprehend substantial catastrophe loss as well as rising expenses to throw tough at the company’s overall functioning. Weak Surprise History: AmTrust Financial has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last three quarters with an average negative surprise of 0.72%.Style Score: AmTrust Financial has a Growth Score of F. The Growth Style Score analyzes the growth prospects for a company, and also evaluates its corporate financial statements. Therefore, the P&C insurer’s Growth Score does not raise too much optimism amongst the investors.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry include Radian Group Inc.

79,PRU,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and its life insurance units’ ratings were reiterated by Moody’s Investors Service. The rating agency affirmed the long-term debt ratings of Prudential and the A1 insurance financial strength (IFS) ratings of its lead operating company — Prudential Insurance Company of America — along with other affiliated US life insurance units (together knows as PICA). Also, the outlook for such ratings was changed from stable to positive.Ratings Representation of Prudential and its UnitsThe ratings representation of Prudential and its units represent the group’s strong foothold and franchise in the U.S. life and retirement market, boasting top 10 positions in numerous product markets. Additionally, the ratings also signify solid regulatory capital levels coupled with an internal capital protection framework during pressure situations.The positive outlook denotes the company’s efforts and progress in lowering high levels of debt and leverage.Notably, consistent decline in leverage and the realization of perpetually stronger, less volatile earnings, can lead to an upgrade of the group’s ratings. This apart, enhanced credit profile of the Japanese operations and increase in cash flow diversity, which is available to the holding company, could also result in the ratings upgrade.On the flip side, stabilization of PICA’s ratings, owing to substantial one-time charges or other factors, deterioration in the credit portfolio of the Japanese operations and total leverage remaining at 40% are a few of the factors that can change the outlook from positive to stable.Factors Resulting in PICA's Ratings UpgradeSome of the factors that can lead to PICA’s ratings upgrade are GAAP return on capital for the U.S. life insurance operations in the high single digits and a continued lowering of earnings volatility along with total consolidated leverage at Prudential moving toward 30%.Factors Likely to Change PICA's OutlookHowever, total consolidated leverage at Prudential remaining at 40% and consolidated GAAP earnings coverage remaining of less than 8x or cash coverage of less than 5x, are a couple of factors that that can change PICA’s outlook from positive to stable.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investors’ confidence and maintaining a stock’s credit worthiness. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help Prudential retain investors’ trust and write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementPrudential holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of Prudential have gained 5.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 8.6% increase.

The company now has more than $65 billion as funded pension account value besides a strong presence in the unfunded U.K. risk transfer business market.Also, Prudential boasts a consolidated international presence, dominated by its Japan operations, constituting about two-fifths of the company’s total operating earnings. The company also enjoys a leading position in the variable annuity market, banking on its diversified product offerings.Prudential enjoys a solid balance sheet, given its access to diversified sources of liquidity and capital markets.

81,PRU,"Investors in Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $40 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Prudential Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Prudential Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Insurance - Multi line industry that ranks in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.57 per share to $2.54 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Prudential Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

82,PRU,"The U.S. Senate passed The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, marking President Donald Trump’s first major legislative victory. The reform, which brings down the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is anticipated to be an overall positive for the corporate sector.Trump noted that such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families, while the White House press secretary said that “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”Notably, this biggest ever one-time drop in business tax will likely be conducive to economic growth. However, insurers and companies in the finance sectors, such as banks, will have to endure some short–term pain before enjoying the benefits.Initial Impact Not So GlossyThe initial impact of tax reduction to be borne by companies in the insurance sector will be in the form of a write-down in deferred tax assets (DTAs). This is also likely to a take a hit at their risk-based capitalization levels.DTAs arise when an insurer records an asset equal to the expected future amount of the tax deduction, because of the requirement to discount loss and unearned premium reserves.  Rating agency Standard & Poor's estimates that its rated U.S. life insurers had about $35 billion of DTA on their statutory balance sheets as of Sep 30, 2017.The new tax bill requires some insurers to write down DTAs to align their balance sheets to the new tax regime.Per the S&P, the reform will lead to an aggregate write-down of about $14 billion of life insurers’ DTA, representing 4% of statutory capital. Consequently, this will hit the capitalization levels of some insurers. Deterioration in Risk Based Capital at regulated subsidiaries would also impact subsidiaries’ ability to pass on dividend capital to the holding company.Reinsurer RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) recently announced an estimated $40 million of reduction in its net income on account of DTAs write-down.MetLife estimates its RBC to be down by 65 basis points. Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) expects an around 100-point impact to the RBC at the PICA level. Torchmark estimated a reduction of around 50 basis points on the assumption that the tax rate would go down to 25% but the magnitude of decline has been more than anticipated.The S&P also stated major changes from the tax bill to multinational entity taxation rules. Shift to a territorial tax system and the base erosion tax provisions will affect U.S. insurers with international operations as well as foreign reinsurers with admitted domestic subsidiaries.The rating agency expects some degree of repatriation of offshore retained profits to bring cash into the country (from foreign subsidiaries). Conversely, the increased excise tax may result in reinsurers and certain insurers, which use offshore reinsurance captives, adjusting their capital optimization strategies or product pricing due to the higher taxes.Long-Term More AttractiveWhile the near-term impact on insurers is not all positive, the long-term effects would definitely be more attractive. A lower tax rate would flow through the bottom line and aid margins directly. Apart from boosting margins, the tax-rate reduction will also make U.S insurers more competitive globally.In addition to the above, the tax reform, which includes lower domestic tax rates on repatriation of income stashed offshore, will well serve foreign insurers that moved abroad the profit generated in the United States to avoid tax.The bill looks like a major legislative achievement, having been supported widely by industry groups. The Coalition for American Insurance, which represents major U.S.-based insurance groups (Alleghany, The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), American Family, American Financial Group Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, Cincinnati Insurance, CAN, EMC Insurance, Liberty Mutual, The Hartford, Travelers and W.R. Berkley Corp.(WRB  -  Free Report), has also endorsed this historical reform.Since the passage of this bill, the industry has grown 0.2%, outperforming the S&P 500’s increase of 0.1%. Going ForwardThe year 2017 had been an eventful one for insurers given huge catastrophe losses on the one hand and the tax reform on the other. We expect 2018 to be smooth for the players as they adjust to the new tax regime and ultimately reap the benefits of a lower tax rate.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors.Attractive Valuation: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio — the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — shares are underpriced at the current level.

Further, a vast distribution network, superior brand image and time-tested presence will provide the company with a competitive edge.Prudential’s Retirement segment is set to benefit from the company’s penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Low interest rate, greater accounting and regulatory changes plus larger-than-expected funding contributions have increased the pension plan sponsors’ risk-taking appetite.Also, variable annuities, which the company considers an important part of its Retirement business, is set to generate improved risk-adjusted returns, specifically with less competition and an improved risk profile.Prudential’s strong international presence boosts its organic portfolio with more growth opportunities than its peers.Despite a low interest rate environment, Prudential has been witnessing a rise in investment income over the last few quarters. The company anticipates the momentum to continue, given the gradual rise of interest rate (three interest rate hikes since December 2016 with expectation for more going forward).     A strong capital position aids the company to return value to shareholders through dividend hikes and buybacks. Since 2011, the capital returned to shareholders amounted to a whopping $14 billion. The board has approved a buyback of $1.25 billion worth shares in 2017.

85,PRU,"American International Group, Inc (AIG  -  Free Report) recently received rating action from Moody's Investors Service, a wing of Moody’s Corp. AIG’s $400 million of 30-year zero coupon senior unsecured notes issued in the Taiwan market has received Baa1 rating from the rating agency.AIG might use the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of existing indebtedness and other general corporate purposes. The rating outlook for AIG remained stable.According to Moody's, these ratings not only reflect AIG’s leadership in global property casualty (P&C) insurance market but also justify its diversified operations across products and geographic regions. In addition, AIG’s strong financial health, supported by solid liquidity has also driven the rating action.However, the company's volatile loss reserves, poor margins in P&C insurance, high exposure to structured and alternative investments, and the complexity of risk management across its geographically diverse business lines continue to hurt.AIG’s exposure to catastrophe losses also remains a major headwind for its P&C operations. The recent catastrophic events like hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria led the company to incur a net loss of $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2017.These negatives have also hurt shareholders’ confidence in the stock. Despite its efforts to return capital to shareholders through extensive share repurchase programs, in a year’s time, the stock has lost nearly 4% while the industry gained 11.4%.Nevertheless, with the appointment of its new CEO in May 2017, the company has taken up strategic initiatives to strengthen its P&C performance. It has started adding and shuffling P&C business leaders, reestablishing some specialty units, strengthening focus on individual account underwriting, reducing certain policy limits and bolstering the catastrophe reinsurance program to curtail earnings volatility.The rating agency believes if these initiatives are executed according to the plan, it will take a couple of years for AIG’s P&C operations to deliver more stable results.According to the rating agency, AIG is likely to witness a ratings upgrade if it can improve the standalone credit profiles of major operating units, generate consolidated return on capital in the high single digits and strengthen financial flexibility.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAIG presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the insurance industry are Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report), First American Financial Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report). Each of the stocks holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

86,PRU,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 operating loss of $1.22 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47%. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported earnings of $1.01 per share.The underperformance stemmed from a $3.0 billion impact from unprecedented catastrophic events like hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. This matched the company’s previously disclosed preliminary loss estimates.Also perturbing was a disclosure by the company that it added $836 million to prior accident year loss reserves.The company is getting along well with its expense reduction program (taken up in Jan 2016 to reduce cost base by $1.4 billion by the end of 2017) as evident by a 15.3% decline in general operating and other expenses (GOE) to $2.1 billion.American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteQuarterly Segment HighlightsCommercial Insurance Suffers From Loss ClaimsNet premiums written were down 13% year over year (both on a reported and a constant dollar basis) to $3.8 billion due to strategic portfolio actions and divestitures.Combined ratio of 195.4% deteriorated a massive 8960 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio, which was due to huge catastrophe losses. This also caused pre-tax operating loss of $2.86 billion in contrast with an operating income of $685 million in the year-ago quarter.Uninspiring Consumer Insurance ResultsPremium and fees of $3.88 billion remained unchanged year over year.Pre-tax operating earnings decreased 18% year over year to $1 billion due to a decline in contribution from Individual Retirement and loss from Personal Insurance sub-segments.The segment’s combined ratio of 105.6% deteriorated 810 points year over year.Financial PositionAt the end of the third quarter, the insurer’s adjusted book value per share (excluding AOCI) was $57.44, down 6.5% year over year.Core adjusted return on equity (ROE) was negative 11.6% compared with 9% in the year-ago quarter.In the third quarter, AIG spent $275 million on share repurchase.Business UpdateIn September, the decision by Financial Stability Oversight Council stripped off the nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution designation on AIG.On Nov 1, 2017, AIG closed the sale of its remaining life settlements’ portfolio, which will result in the remittance of $1.1 billion of cash proceeds to AIG Parent in fourth-quarter 2017 and fulfill the $9 billion return of Legacy capital.Turn Around Might Take Some More TimeAIG’s results reflect the wrath of Mother Nature. The company has been suffering from tough markets conditions and its massive size, with numerous uncorrelated businesses creating little or no synergy. A number of asset sale and business divestitures made over the last many years have however streamlined the company to some extent.Last quarter, the insurance giant appointed Brian Duperreault as it new CEO, with expectations of improving operations, by completing restructuring initiatives already underway and making further changes.Nevertheless its underperforming commercial lines business, and exposure to catastrophe continue to bother. We believe it will take a while for the efforts to show actual results.Zacks Rank and Other PlayersAIG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among the other players in the same space, the bottom line at MetLife Inc.

Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the estimates.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    Factors to be Considered This QuarterConsecutive catastrophes likely have been a drag on CNA Financial’s (CNA  -  Free Report) third-quarter results. However, an intensified focus on underwriting standards might have limited this downside.Last quarter, the Diamond Offshore (DO  -  Free Report) segment benefited from higher contract drilling revenues and cost containment. The yet-to-be reported quarter likely has witnessed these favorable factors leading to higher contribution from Diamond Offshore.Results at Loews Hotels are expected to have improved this yet-to-be-reported quarter.Expenses likely have increased, weighing on the desired margin expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Loews Corp. is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Loews Corp. has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

89,PRU,"Third-quarter earnings season has seen 164 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported quarterly results so far. Let’s see how the quarter is turning up for the life and non-life or property and casualty (P&C) insurance space.No doubt, the third quarter is characterized by a barrage of catastrophe events that wreaked havoc. While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in the regions across the Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered costliest in a decade. Incidentally, Maria hit Puerto Rico and Virginia Island with two Mexican tremors further adding to the woes.Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion.Underwriting profitability, a measure of P&C insurers’ performance, has been severely hampered in the third quarter. While most P&C insurers’ profits declined compared with the year-ago results, some have incurred losses in the quarter. Combined ratios have deteriorated badly and pricing remained soft.However, capital accumulation from a not-so-active catastrophe environment in the previous quarters, prudent underwriting standards as well as cost control measures will cushion insurers.Amid bad news, a silver lining in the cloud is the gradual improvement in the interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve has made three hikes since December 2016. The third quarter continues to enjoy the positive impact of a favorable rate environment, driving the insurer’s investment results and performance of life insurers.Improving interest rates came in as a sign of relief for the life insurers that suffered a spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Investment yield is also likely to have improved. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, a progressing economy means more disposable income and a better-consumer sentiment. This, in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, thus driving premiums higher. Premiums contribute a lion’s share to an insurer’s top line.With strong positives guarding the results, investors can bet on the stocks, poised to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming reports.  Ways to Pick the Right Insurance StocksChoosing the right stock for one’s portfolio from too many participants is a daunting task for investors. But an easy way to trim the list is by looking at the stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) that are likely to surpass estimates.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks with the best chances of delivering an earnings surprise in their next announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Please check our Earnings ESP Filter that enables you to find stocks with the potential to come up with an earnings beat.Our research shows that for the stocks with an ideal combination of two key ingredients, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.For investors seeking to apply this strategy to their portfolios, we have highlighted four insurance stocks that might stand out with earnings beats in their upcoming releases.  Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report)Newark, NJ-based Prudential offers an array of financial products and services including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management and real estate services.With a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.07%, Prudential looks well-poised for a positive surprise.

The company will redeem these notes on Dec 11, 2017.American Financial’s debt-to-equity ratio at third-quarter end was 23.9, improved merely 210 basis points from 2016-end level. With the new issuance and redemption of some notes, the ratio is expected to decrease 20 basis points.These transactions will surely lower the company’s interest expense as notes with higher coupon rates are redeemed and those that are issued, bear lower coupon rates.It seems a prudent approach by American Financial to capitalize on the low interest rate environment to procure funds. Also, this will lower the interest burden on borrowings, facilitating margin expansion. Though the Federal Reserve has increased the interest rate thrice since December 2016, the rate environment still remains low. American Financial estimates after-tax interest savings of about $13 million or 14 cents per share in 2018 from these two transactions.However, the company expects to incur about $27 million or 30 cents per share after-tax non-core expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to early redemption of the 9-7/8% senior notes.Rating Agencies Jump Into ActionBoth 3.50% and 4.50% senior notes carry Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings of “a-” with stable ratings from A.M. Best. Concurrently, Moody's Investors Service, a wing of Moody's Corporation, assigned Baa1 ratings with stable outlook to these notes.Price PerfromanceShares of American Financial have rallied 20.3% quarter to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.6%. We believe that the company’s strategic initiatives to boost margin expansion, inorganic growth profile, better pricing and improvement of industry fundamentals will continue to drive the shares higher.American Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).    Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Radian Group Inc.(RDN  -  Free Report), First American Financial Corp.

95,PRU,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc’s (HIG  -  Free Report) strategic dispositions of its legacy run-off businesses have improved its risk profile. In addition, divesture of its non-core businesses along with strategic acquisitions and alliances have helped it concentrate on core U.S. operations.The company also displays intelligent capital management by enhancing shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend payments on a regular basis.Its shares have rallied nearly 16.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.4% in a year’s time. This reflects the company’s strong foothold in the property and casualty market.The company’s capital appreciations, repayment of government funds and measures to de-risk its balance sheet have increased its financial strength. The company has also been able to successfully lower its debt burden through divestures and notes issuance.Nevertheless, being a property and casualty insurer, the company also remains exposed to numerous catastrophic events, which often result in earnings volatility. Its third-quarter 2017 results were highly impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Its Personal lines segment has also incurred considerable amount of auto liability loss. Continuing the previous trend, the segment’s revenues further declined in the first nine months of 2017. Also, the Talcott Resolution segment has been a drag for quite some time.Consequently, the company’s valuation looks expensive at the current level. Looking at the company’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E-F1) ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. Currently, it has trailing 12-months P/E-F1 ratio of 15.1, which is higher than the industry average of 14.2.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHartford Financial presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the insurance industry are Radian Group Inc.

96,PRU,"Today, investors often place their faith in stocks that they think are poised to grow exponentially in both the near and long-term. This often leaves growth-minded investors fixated on stocks such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which continue on their meteoric climbs.Yet, at a time when many investors target superior growth—often in favor of many other metrics—value investing can still be a solid way to invest.A company that currently presents great value for investors is Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report).Let’s take a look at Prudential’s most recent quarterly results and more of the financial firm’s current fundamentals to help investors gauge whether they want to consider Prudential stock at this time.Fundamentals Prudential posted its third-quarter results last week.

Prudential is currently trading at 10.92x earnings, which marks big discount compared to the “Insurance - Multi line” industry’s average.On top of its solid PE ratio, Prudential’s 0.84 price to sales ratio is also strong and comes in well below its industry’s 1.07 average. The firm’s P/S ratio also marks a discount compared to some of its biggest competitors, such as AIG (AIG  -  Free Report). Prudential’s P/B ratio of 0.84 is also a major discount compared to the industry and helps boost the firm’s overall value-based resume.Along with these valuation metrics, Prudential currently presents a decent dividend yield of 2.68%.Prudential Financial, Inc.

98,PRU,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.40%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterChubb’s third quarter underwriting results will be affected by strings of cat events. Chubb has projected catastrophe losses from Hurricane Harvey is estimated to be nearly $520 million after-tax, whereas from Irma, it is expected to range between $640 million and $760 million after-tax. Such losses are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio is currently pegged at 101%, a deterioration of 980 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Premiums earned likely have reduced in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to the company’s inability to generate enough underwriting returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $7.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 2.8% on a year-over year basis.Additionally, the company might have incurred higher expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses and policy benefits. This in turn will weigh on the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, higher net investment income and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is currently pegged at a loss of 26 cents, compared to the earnings of $2.88 in the year-ago quarter. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $830 and $840.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

100,PRU,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect the company’s Market Services segment, a major contributor to Nasdaq’s total revenues, to not only boost top-line growth but also improve the company’s overall performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Higher revenues from the buyout of International Securities Exchange (ISE) and European cash equities are expected to lead to an improvement in Market Services’ revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market Services revenues is currently pegged at $147 million, an increase of 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.The aforementioned segment is likely to have delivered positive organic growth, primarily driven by a solid market share performance across its largest trading categories — U.S. options, U.S. equities and European equities, together with continued positive organic growth in Trade Management Services.Even though the company has been displaying weak equity trading performance over a considerable period of time, Nasdaq’s organic growth has seen a consistent rise. Therefore, the company has likely delivered noticeable organic growth in the quarter to be reported, driven by its strategy of expediting the non-transaction revenue base that includes market technology, listing and information revenues.However, the company is likely to have incurred higher expenses in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to development and diversification of its business. This in turn has likely restricted operating margin expansion.Additionally, the company might witness lower cash equity trading revenues, owing to decrease in revenue per contract and a weak trading activity in the industry, along with regulatory changes and adverse forex impact may lead to lower cash equity trading revenues. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net cash equity trading revenues is currently pegged at $60 million, reflecting a slip of 1.6% from the prior-year quarter. Decreased cash equity trading revenues can weigh on the bottom-line of the company.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Nasdaq has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Nasdaq has an Earnings ESP of +0.49%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.03 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The positive ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise.

QuoteZacks Rank: Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 along with a positive Earnings ESP, have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are as follows:Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 1 with an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #2.

101,PRU,"The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is broadly considered by value investors as a useful yardstick for working out the fair market value of a stock. Many prefer to take the P/E route in their pursuit of a portfolio of stocks with attractive prices. But even this ubiquitously used valuation metric is not without its pitfalls.EV/EBITDA is a Better Substitute, Here’s WhyAlthough the widespread use of P/E stems from its simplicity, a more-complicated metric called EV/EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better approach as it offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P/E just considers its equity portion.Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is a firm’s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash. In a nutshell, it is the total value of a company.EBITDA, the other element, gives a clearer picture of a company’s profitability as it strips out the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more alluring it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued.Unlike P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA takes debt on a company’s balance sheet into account. Due to this reason, EV/EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another key drawback of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making entity. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV/EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positive.EV/EBITDA is also a useful tool in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV/EBITDA is also not without its downsides and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.Thus, instead of solely relying on EV/EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen bargain stocks.Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 14 stocks that passed the screen:The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.

102,PRU,"CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct 26 before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. Let’s see what it has in store for this yet-to-be reported quarter.CME Group’s top line has likely improved owing to higher clearing and transaction fees. The company’s efforts to ramp up organic market data growth will add to the top line. The Zacks Consensus estimate for market data and information services are pegged at $96 million.CME Group’s average daily volume (ADV) for the third quarter stood at 15.7 million contracts, up 10% year over year. Five of its six product lines delivered growth in ADV in the third quarter.About 74% of CME Group’s metal options currently trade electronically. Metals’ ADV in the third quarter increased 42%, the highest across its six product lines.However, license fees likely have increased on the back of transfer of the Russell products in July and aggregate changes in licenses.The tax rate likely has increased in the third quarter, given an increase in the Illinois state income tax.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.16 per share on $889.9 million revenues. The bottom line reflects a 10.6% rise, while the top line translates to an increase of 5.7%, both on a year-over-year basis.What our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CME Group is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: CME Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

103,PRU,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 39.13%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the third quarter as well as the Mexico earthquakes, Cincinnati Financial’s underwriting results will be significantly impacted in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The massive catastrophe losses will not only affect underwriting profitability but also render volatility to the company’s earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is 53 cents that represents a noticeable decline of 38.4% from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer’s unit, The Cincinnati Insurance Companies’ property casualty group, has projected third-quarter 2017 pre-tax catastrophe losses to range between $102 million and $114 million, approximately. This will leave an impact on the third-quarter combined ratio of about 860-960 basis points on the basis of estimated property casualty earned premiums.Additionally, the company projects its third-quarter property casualty combined ratio to range between 98.5% and 101.5%, including the effect of catastrophe losses.Further, the company has possibly recorded an increase in total benefits and expenses, mainly driven by higher insurance losses and contract holders’ benefits, underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses as well as other operating costs. This in turn might restrict the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the third quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. To that end, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2017 is $1.4 billion that represents an increase of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter.Also, investment results likely have improved backed by an increase in both interest and dividend income.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

104,PRU,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.87%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the third quarter as well as the Mexico earthquakes, XL Group’s underwriting profitability will be largely hampered in the soon-to-be- reported quarter. Notably, the company has estimated catastrophe losses for the third quarter to be about $1.35 billion. This in turn might lead to a noticeable deterioration in the combined ratio as well.Also, the company is expecting a fall in net investment income, owing to the still low-interest rate environment. In addition, improvement in investment income is closely associated with the credit markets and volatility in such markets can render instability in investment earnings.Further, the company might experience a decline in gross written premiums in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. This is mainly due to a large international casualty quota share treaty in the previous year, which did not get renewed, as well as a cancelled business that did not meet the company’s expectations.Nonetheless, lower operating expenses and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. In fact, the company expects to complete not less than $700 million in buyback in 2017. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that XL Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

106,PRU,"The euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation is pushing Wall Street to new heights this year. After hitting 2,700 on the second trading session of the New Year, the S&P 500 breached another milestone of 2,800, for the first time.Moreover, the Dow Jones also crossed the 26,000 mark, easily setting the record for the fastest 1,000-point rise in its history after topping 25,000 on Jan 4 (read: Top & Flop ETFs of the New Year).Buoyancy FlowingThe massive $1.5-trillion tax cuts will create an economic surge both domestic and international, boosting job growth and earnings of corporates. Additionally, jump in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat economic data added to the strength. Manufacturing activity, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management, climbed to the second-highest reading in six years while construction spending hit record highs in November with broad-based gains in both private and public outlays. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, capping the strongest year of sales growth since 2014.The market is anticipating that companies will come up with big gains in earnings and increased estimates for this year driven by tax cut savings. The Q4 earnings season is off to a strong start, with earnings of 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 13.6% from the same period last year on 9.1% higher revenues, with 73.1% beating EPS estimates and 80.8% beating revenue estimates. Overall, total earnings and revenues are projected to grow 9.2% and 7%, respectively (read: 4 ETFs & Stocks from Favorite Sectors for Q4 Earnings).However, the rally fizzled out later in yesterday’s trading session on concerns over the possible government shutdown. This represents the second drop so far this year. Congress needs to pass a spending bill by the end of Jan 19 to avoid a government shutdown. This pullback could be just a pause in the rally as traders took the chance to book some profits after a record run.Given the bullish fundamentals, the dips might charge up investors to snap up stocks and ETFs on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

107,PRU,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) recently purchased The Daniels Group, Inc., expected to boost its employee benefits consulting and brokerage operations as well as solidify the company’s presence in the Northeast region of the United States.  However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Details of the TransactionEstablished in 1991, Daniels Group offers employee benefits and brokerage services. It also primarily caters to clients associated with corporations, schools, hospitals, municipalities, religious and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, it is actively involved in designing and implementing a plan as well as its administration. Post takeover, the company will shift base to Arthur J. Gallagher's Whippany office, based in New Jersey.The latest buyout is expected to strengthen the already robust inorganic growth portfolio of the acquirer. New Providence, NJ-based Daniels Group brings in similar work culture and interdependent core strengths to the aforementioned practice areas, which in turn, are anticipated to be highly value accretive to Arthur J. Gallagher’s client portfolio. With this acquisition, the insurance broker will not only be able to improve its employee benefits consulting and brokerage operations but also fortify its footprint in the Northeast region of the United States.Over the past few years, Arthur J. Gallagher’s impressive growth has been mainly fueled by organic sales as well as prudent acquisitions and mergers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company made seven acquisitions and the momentum continued in the first quarter of 2018. The latest transaction marked the second buyout of the first quarter with the company recently buying AquaSurance, LLC, which is expected to strengthen the insurance broker’s portfolio in providing insurance services to its existing Texas water utility business. Therefore, such strategic initiatives will improve the company’s top line, resulting in overall growth.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementArthur J. Gallagher holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have rallied 21.5% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rise of 18.4%. We expect top-line growth, prudent acquisitions and a strong capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term.  Notably, the company’s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 11.10%, better than the industry’s average of 10.80%. The insurance broker is set to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because although its bullish Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of -0.45% however, leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry might also consider Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report), Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report), each being a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.   Radian Group offers mortgage and real estate products and services in the United States. The company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.52%.Cigna provides insurance and related products and services in the United States and internationally. The company came up with positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 14.56%.  Prudential Financial provides insurance, investment management and other financial products and services in the United States and internationally. The company pulled off positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 0.16%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

108,PRU,"Residents of southeastern Texas are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which continues to wreak havoc on America’s fourth-largest city with heavy rainfall. The record-flood situation is likely to turn worse as the deluge is expected to continue for some days, as per Bloomberg. It is predicted to become the first storm of Category 3 or higher to hit Texas in the last 12 years.Needless to say, a catastrophe of this level is most likely to mess up citizens’ lives. With them, several effects on corporate life are likely to be noted.Energy As per Reuters, Harvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and over 10% of U.S. refining capacity. The area is a major hub for oil refineries. Several energy companies have shut down their operations. The last major storm that lashed this region in 2008 was Hurricane Ike, which cost the refining industry roughly $30 billion.This sparked off concerns about oversupply situation in the U.S. Lower demand from refineries is likely to pressure crude oil prices and ETFs like United States Oil Fund LP (USO  -  Free Report). Oil exploration ETF like The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report) this may lose ahead due to lack of activity.However, demand for finished product gasoline should rise. Gasoline futures on Monday jumped to a two-year high level, which should benefit United States Gasoline Fund (UGA  -  Free Report).  The difference in the price of crude oil for October delivery and Nymex gasoline futures for September — the ""crack spread"" — doubled to about $24 on Friday, as per an article published on CNBC. This should benefit VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK  -  Free Report) (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Insurance Severe destruction is likely after Harvey’s passage as flooding in Texas may be identical to that of 2005's Hurricane Katrina -- “the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, said an insurance research group.” Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm and severe flooding.John Dickson, president of NFS Edge Insurance Agency, estimates about 15% of the Houston area to be insured for flood. As a result, property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp. PGR are likely to be hurt. The insurance ETF iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Agriculture As per Bloomberg,the rain is washing away the largest U.S. cotton producer, drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers. Ports like Galveston will remain closed till Harvey dies out.The Bloomberg article went on to point out that ports at the Texas Gulf make up about 24% of U.S. wheat exports, 3% of corn shipments and 2% of soybeans. Naturally, this pseudo supply crisis will likely push up crop prices, benefiting ETFs like iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN, Teucrium Wheat Fund (WEAT  -  Free Report), Teucrium Corn ETF (CORN  -  Free Report) and Teucrium Soybean ETF (SOYB  -  Free Report). In fact, in such a heavy downpour, livestock is also at risk, which may push up iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN LSTK (read: Should You Ride the Momentum in Grain ETFs?).Transportation Rail transportation near Houston has been delayed and massive gridlock on highways is expected. As many as 1,847 flights were canceled on Sunday at airports in Houston, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, and an additional 1,580 were called off for Monday, according to FlightAware and quoted on Bloomberg. Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) may feel the pressure ahead (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

109,PRU,"The insurance industry has been shaping up well this reporting cycle with robust earnings from leading players. Prominent players such as MetLife (MET  -  Free Report), Chubb Corp (CB  -  Free Report) and Allstate (ALL  -  Free Report) surpassed both our earnings and revenue estimates, while Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) lagged revenue estimates. American International (AIG  -  Free Report) too beat our earnings estimate, while Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) and Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) missed the same. However, Travelers topped our revenue estimates (read: ETFs to Buy or Avoid After Strong Q2 GDP).Insurance Earnings in FocusMetLife, the U.S. life insurer behemoth, reported robust earnings of $1.30 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 and improved 57% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 3% year over year to $17.6 billion and were well ahead of our estimate of $17.1 billion. On the other hand, PRU, the second largest U.S. life insurer, missed our earnings estimate by 61 cents. Earnings improved 13.6% year over year. Revenues increased 10.2% year over year to $13 billion.One of the leading property and casualty insurers, Chubb, reported earnings per share of $2.50, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and improving 11% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $8.1 billion also edged past our estimate of $7.5 billion. Another property and casualty insurer, Allstate, also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings and revenues by 53.3% and 13.9%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues grew 122.6% and 4.6%, respectively.AIG, one of the largest commercial insurer in the U.S. and Canada, beat our earnings estimate by 27.5%. Earnings per share of $1.83 reported by Aflac, the seller of supplement health insurance, trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.3% and increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. However, revenues of $5.4 billion fell short of our estimate of $5.48 billion (see: all the Financial ETFs here).Personal property and casualty insurer Travelers posted earnings per share of $1.92, missing our estimate by 24 cents and declining 12.7% year over year. Revenues grew 5.9% year over year to $7.2 billion and were ahead of our estimate of $6.9 billion.ETFs in FocusGiven the robust Q2 results, insurance ETFs – SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE  -  Free Report) and iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK  -  Free Report) – have been outperforming the other corners of the financial space over the last one month. This is especially true as KIE and IAK gained 3% and 2.2%, respectively compared with gains of 1.9% for the broad financial ETF (XLF  -  Free Report). However, these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a Medium risk outlook.KIEThis fund follows the S&P Insurance Select Industry Index, holding 52 stocks in its basket. Each of the in-focus firms accounts for around 2% share each. About 41.1% of the portfolio is allocated to the property and casualty insurance sector, while life & health insurance accounts for 26% share. The ETF has managed $954.1 million in its asset base and trades in a good average daily volume of about 130,000 shares. The product has an expense ratio of 0.35%.IAKWith AUM of $178.6 million, this product tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Insurance Index and charges 44 bps in annual fees. Volume is light, trading in roughly 11,000 shares per day. In total, the fund holds 63 securities in its basket with double-digit allocation going to Chubb. The other in-focus firms – AIG, MET, PRU, TRV, ALL and AFL – collectively make up for 38.7% of assets. Here also, property & casualty insurance accounts for the largest share at 45.2%, while life & health insurance and multiline insurance round off the top three with a double-digit exposure each (read: 4 ETFs to Ride on 16-Year High Consumer Confidence). Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

110,PRU,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to the growing demands and expectations of its clients for years, building a solid product and service portfolio over time. Retaining this optimism, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) multi-line insurer continues to evolve stronger and looks set to repeat the success streak in the near future.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $10.09 on revenues of $52.10 billion for 2017. Although the top line reflects a year-over-year slip of 0.3%, the bottom line improves 10.6%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $11.22 on $54.16 billion revenues. While earnings represent an 11.2% increase, revenues reflect a 3.9% rise.  Prudential Financial has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Northbound Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has inched up 0.1% in the last 60 days, while the same for 2018 has nudged up 0.2% over the same time frame. This is reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank.An Outperformer: Shares of Prudential Financial have surged 29.3% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 21.8% rally. We expect the company’s sustained operational performance, improving asset under management and a robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Attractive Valuation: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.9, falling significantly below the industry average of 1.4. Also, the stock carries Value Score of A. Back-tested results have shown stocks with Value Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 are best investment bets.Earnings ESP and Surprise History: The company is set to release third quarter results on Nov 1, 2017. Our proven model conclusively shows that it is likely to beat on earnings this time around as the company has a favorable Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.74%. Prudential has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.Growth DriversThe insurer will continue to benefit from its massive reach and an in-depth expertise in the pension risk transfer (PRT) business. The company is also on track to establish a leadership position in the potentially strong PRT market, suitable to mobilize the insurance company’s skills in the management of group annuity.Interestingly, the company arrived at a decision to realign U.S. businesses to position itself better to leverage business mix and capture the long-term growth opportunities within and across domestic businesses.The company’s international operations too have placed it well for long-term growth. It is expected to gain from the AFP Habitat buyout, completed in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction, expanding its international footprint, is estimated to result in a stable rise, steady earnings and an adequate cash flow generation. Therefore, the organization remains focused on diversifying activities to enable it to accelerate overall growth and keep up the streak in the immediate term as well.  Additionally, Prudential has prosperously generated investors’ value. It has been approved to buy back worth $1.25 billion shares in 2017. The company remains committed toward maintaining a solid capital and liquidity status, thus protecting itself from market volatility.Near-Term Headwinds: However, an unfavorable currency impact and regulatory control remain challenges to tide over. In addition, rising expenses have been spoilers for the insurer and that does not expect a turnaround anytime soon.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry are Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report), each carrying the same bullish Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Principal Financial offers retirement, asset management plus insurance products and services to businesses, individuals and institutional clients worldwide. The company delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.26%.Cigna Corporation offers insurance and health-related products and services in the United States and internationally. The company delivered positive surprises in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.98%.Cincinnati Financial deals in property casualty insurance business in the United States. The company delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 14.97%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

111,PRU,"Prudential Financial Inc.’s (PRU  -  Free Report) 4.50% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes worth $750 million have recently received rating action from credit rating agencies. These subordinated debts are scheduled to mature by 2047.While A.M. Best assigned the Long-Term Issue Credit Rating (Long-Term IR) of “bbb”, Moody’s Investors Service, a wing of Moody’s Corporation, assigned a Baa2 rating. The outlook is stable for the ratings assigned by both the rating giants.Prudential intends to utilize the proceeds to refinance an 8.9% junior subordinated note issue worth $600 million that is scheduled to mature before 2018. The funds will also be utilized to repay, partly, medium-term notes as well as for general corporate purposes.The approach by Prudential to capitalize on the still-low interest rate environment to procure funds appears prudent. Also, this might lower the interest burden on borrowings, facilitating margin expansion.The company exited the last-reported quarter with its debt balance rising 1.2% from the 2016-end level. Long-term debt to equity ratio was 0.36, up 30 basis points. With the new issuance, the long-term debt-to-equity ratio would  improve by 2 basis points.The company’s long-term credit rating reflects robust operating performance in its key business segments along with diversified earnings and strong liquidity position. According to A.M. Best, the company has always resorted to utilizing a significant amount of debts. The recent issuance would increase the existing amount of debts.Moody’s also stated that Baa1 senior as well as A1 insurance financial strength rating of its U.S. life insurance operating companies are driven by the group’s solid market position and leading presence in the pension risk-transfer market. However, these positives are weighed on by the company’s size despite various initiatives to simply the structure and improve leverage. Nonetheless, the rating agency stated that even after the new issuance, leverage will remain within its guidelines.Moody’s stated that the ratings could be upgraded if the total debt-equity ratio is below 30%, Prudential Insurance Company of America (PICA) is upgraded or if there is an increase in cash flows available to the holding company, if the RBC is at least 400% and dividends from non U.S. life insurance subsidiaries account for a higher percentage of holding company cash flows.Similarly, the rating agency stated that the ratings could be subject to downgrade if there is a decline in the credit profile of its Japanese operations, total debts surge 40%, consolidated GAAP earnings coverage plunges 6x and cash coverage plunges less than 3x on a consistent basis or if there an increase in transactions by the subsidiaries that might deteriorate the quality of regulatory capital.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies have always played a significant role in retaining investors’ confidence as well as in exhibiting the credit worthiness of the companies. Whereas, rating downgrades reflect companies’ deteriorating finances and high debt levels, which raise the cost of further debt issuances. These ratings of Prudential Financial will not only help it boost investors’ confidence but will also enable it to fulfill various capital needs.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementPrudential Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have gained 28.4% in a year’s time, slightly underperforming the industry’s 27.8% growth. Nonetheless, we expect the company’s widened international presence, compelling portfolio and efficient capital management to drive its shares in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) and FBL Financial Group, Inc (FFG  -  Free Report).Kemper Corporation, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), provides property & casualty, and life & health insurance services in the United States.

Shares have lost about 13.8% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Prudential Financial Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues RisePrudential Financial’s second-quarter 2017 operating income of $2.09 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70 by 22.6%.

113,PRU,"Even before the country could heave a sigh of relief post Hurricane Harvey, another storm started brewing in the open Atlantic Ocean. The new threat called Hurricane Irma has been accredited the Category 5 status (the highest degree) and is feared to be more disastrous than Harvey. It is expected to ravage the Caribbean islands and Florida this week. Florida announced a state of emergency.Below we highlight a few potential ETF and stock winners and losers from Irma.LosersInsurance Severe destruction is likely in Florida. Insured losses could be as high as $125 billion to $130 billion, as per an analyst at Barclays, quoted on Bloomberg. Property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month, following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm. So, the impact of Hurricane Irma on insurance stocks is anybody’s guess. Already, shares of property and casualty homeowners insurance companies like Universal Insurance Holdings Inc. UVE, Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc. HRTG and HCI Group Inc. HCI plunged about 14.6%, 17% and 20% on Sep 5. Reinsurers XL Group Ltd XL and Everest Re Group Ltd. RE too lost about 5.8% and 6.9%, respectively.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited CB, Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU and Progressive Corp. PGR are also likely to be hit hard. Naturally, the insurance ETFs iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) andSPDR S&P Insurance ETF KIE will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Transportation As per an article published on CNBC, a severe impact from Irma could roil rail and container activity, and crush infrastructure for transportation. Airlines started considering Florida airports for their Hurricane Irma change-fee waivers. American (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) are some of the airlines doing this.As per the policy, “they permitted customers to make one change to their itineraries without paying change fees that can cost $200 or more per passenger.” Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS may feel the pressure ahead.Cruise LinesSince Caribbean islands are famed for cruise trips, cruise stocks and ETFs deserve a special mention in this case. Operators are abandoning trips that haven’t left port.Carnival Corp. CCL, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) lost about 3.1%, 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, on Sep 5.  With this, PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment (PEJ  -  Free Report) and iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Discretionary ETF (CNDF) could feel a slight adverse impact as these funds have certain exposure to cruise lines (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).RestaurantsAnalysts are apprehensive that restaurants may see considerable sales reduction and destruction due to Irma. A Canaccord analyst said that some restaurants have considerable exposure to Florida. Among these, Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc. FRGI (37% exposure), Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc.

Key cotton-producing areas around the Gulf Coast have already suffered from flooded fields caused by Hurricane Harvey. Crops in parts of Georgia and South Carolina will also be at risk of yield losses from Irma, as per MDA and quoted on Bloomberg. As a result, cotton prices rallied. iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN jumped about 7.3% on Sep 5.Lumber prices surged on apprehensions of damage. This should act as a tailwind foriShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD  -  Free Report) while orange prices skyrocketed as Florida is key growing region of oranges.Home Retailers The condition of houses in an area ravaged by a massive storm with 180 mile-per-hour winds can well be imagined. So, home improvement retailers like Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) (up 1.43% on Sep 5) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW) (up 1.4%) are in a bright spot. ETFs like Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction (PKB  -  Free Report) should also benefit (read: Home Retailer ETFs Set to Gain After Harvey).Infrastructure First Harvey, and now Irma should shower gains on infrastructure stocks as re-building will push up their demand. So, companies dealing in building materials should see a surge. The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) have high chances of outperforming.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

115,PRU,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) recently purchased AquaSurance, LLC, which is expected to strengthen the acquirer’s portfolio in providing insurance services to its existing Texas water utility business. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Details of the TransactionEstablished in 2002, Houston, TX-based AquaSurance operates as a property/casualty broker. The company primarily focuses on serving Texas water utilities. Post takeover, it will shift base to Arthur J. Gallagher's Houston Galleria office.The latest buyout is expected to strengthen the already robust inorganic growth portfolio of the acquirer. Also, AquaSurance’s emphasis on catering to the particular needs of water utilities is anticipated to be highly value accretive to Arthur J. Gallagher’s portfolio that serves Texas water utility business. With this buyout, the insurance broker will not only be able to improve its public entity practice but also grow its existing water utility business in the South Central region of the United States.Riding High on AcquisitionsOver the past few years, Arthur J. Gallagher’s impressive growth has been mainly fueled by organic sales as well as prudent acquisitions and mergers. The insurance broker has closed 27 acquisitions with annualized revenues of over $129.7 million in the first nine months of 2017. In addition, the company has put in substantial efforts to further accelerate its acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas. Arthur J. Gallagher’s merger and acquisition pipeline remains strong with about $250 million of revenues.Such strategic initiatives will improve the company’s top line, resulting in its overall growth. Additionally, the company’s brokerage segment has been witnessing excellent results over a considerable period of time. The insurance broker expects better organic growth for this segment in 2018 than it recorded in 2017. Therefore, Arthur J. Gallagher’s stellar growth graph continues to impress investors.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementArthur J. Gallagher holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have gained 21% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18.5%. We expect top-line growth, prudent acquisitions and a strong capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term.  The insurance broker is set to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 25.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because although the bullish Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of -0.45% leaves the conclusion inconclusive.  Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors also interested in other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry might consider Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report), each being a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

116,PRU,"The second-quarter earnings season is in top gear with 57.2% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 286 index members (accounting for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 11.3% on 6.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 74.5% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 69.2%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 70.5% companies on the S&P 500 Index that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.6% earnings growth on 5.1% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 79.1% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 68.7% for the top line is lower than the same of S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. A few insurers are anticipated to have incurred losses due to natural calamities in the second quarter, stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events, occurred during April and May in the U.S.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion, piled up on a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have also supported more policy writings, driving the premiums higher to generate a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line. Besides, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably boosted the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been ironing out the creases of pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing.Let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is engaged in a range of global insurance and insurance-related activities through its subsidiaries. Last quarter, AIG substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.52%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.83% leave our earnings surprise prediction inconclusive. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.19 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.20. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 for an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Individual Retirement business too has remained low due to uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales limiting the sales improvement. Sales growth has likely improved in Life Insurance business. Expenses too have possibly moderated.

117,PRU,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Prudential Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Prudential Financial’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Prudential Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 11.1, which is in line with the current level. Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company’s current share price.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Prudential Financial has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.PRU is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Prudential Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Prudential Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Prudential Financial is 1.4, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 11.2, which is better than the industry average of 11.5. Clearly, PRU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Prudential Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F. This gives PRU a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter as well as the full year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 3.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus  Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePrudential Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 38% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past one year, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Earnings were up 33% year over year.Better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong performance by the company’s consumer business, partially offset by losses incurred by its commercial business. Also, cost-control efforts and shares bought back during the quarter aided the bottom line.The company is getting along well with its expense reduction program (taken up in Jan 2016 to reduce cost base by $1.4 billion by the end of 2017) as evident by a 15.6% decline in general operating and other expenses (GOE) to $2.2 billion.Quarterly Segment HighlightsCommercial InsuranceNet premiums written were down 15% (or 9% on a constant dollar basis) year over year to $3.8 billion due to strategic portfolio actions and an unfavorable market.Combined ratio of 102.7% deteriorated 440 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio.The segment’s pre-tax operating income of $716 million increased 24% year over year.Consumer InsurancePremium and fees of $3.9 billion remained unchanged year over year.

120,PRU,"CNO Financial Group, Inc.’s (CNO  -  Free Report) financial health remains impressive.  Strong cash position enables the company to enhance shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives. It has been raising quarterly dividend since 2013. Frequent share repurchase programs have been a major capital deployment strategy for the company. These initiatives have helped the company retain shareholders’ confidence in the stock.Year to date, its shares have gained nearly 32%, outperforming the Zacks Multi-Line Insurance industry’s rally of 11%.The company has been witnessing consistent growth in revenues backed by solid performance of its Washington National segment. Sales at the segment have been rising over the last few quarters. The company further expects to regain sales growth momentum at Washington National by restructuring the field leadership to drive greater accountability and geographic coverage, adding recruiting support and introducing new products in mobile technology to enhance agent productivity.CNO Financial has also been making several investments to improve its operations. It has substantially invested in key initiatives like agent productivity, geographic expansion, product launches, worksite platform distribution as well as enhancement of operating efficiencies and customer retention.However, the company continues to face underwriting and pricing challenges in the long-term care business. Sustained weak performance of this segment has been affecting the company’s top line and bottom line adversely.CNO Financial suffers from rising level of debt that continues to push up interest expenses as well. This increasing trend in interest expenses has been raising the company’s financial risk and hurting profitability.Moreover, CNO Financial’s valuation looks expensive at the current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium.

121,PRU,"This week, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets for the final time under outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who will step down from the Fed following a four-year reign as a relatively dovish, yet consistent, head custodian of the U.S. economy. She will be replaced early next year by President Trump’s pick, Jerome “Jay” Powell.Currently the Fed funds rate is at 1.25%, and with chances just about zero that there won’t be a hike this week, market participants are already pricing the quarter-point hike to 1.5%. This is obviously the highest the Fed funds rate will have reached since the Great Recession caused the rate to be pulled all the way down to 0 (actually 0.25%).This slow and steady methodology has taken longer than many had anticipated to reach equilibrium, but we are definitely there now: with inflation currently registering at 1.6% — close to the optimum Yellen & Co. had long been seeking of 2% — while unemployment — the other half of the Fed’s dual mandate — came in at an historically low 4.1% just last Friday.Looking into 2018, however, many analysts expect big changes: the massive tax cut for U.S. businesses and some individuals looks to both lower the unemployment rate further (based on the argument that cutting corporate taxes from 35% to 20% will lead to more job creation) and spike inflation higher (because along with all these new jobs we can also expect higher wage growth, which is a key sign of rising inflation). Meaning that we look to be heading toward sub-4% unemployment, but inflation could surge well above 2% in relatively short order.Part of the Fed’s job in conducting interest rate changes is to sop up some of this inflation before it gallops out of control, so speculation is rife about how many times the Fed will raise rates in 2018. Obviously, much will pivot on if and when the tax cuts are passed through Congress and implemented into the economy; if it’s before Christmas or right after New Year’s, it’s likely we’ll see a March rate hike, if not sooner. Should things take a little longer, the Powell-led Fed may take a page from the Yellen playbook and await economic evidence of job and inflation growth before moving.There is also the issue of how much the Fed might raise when it finally decides to, again dependent on the lay of the economic land next year. Should the economy heat up faster than expected, look for speculation involving a half-point rate hike (from 1.5% to 2%) instead of a quarter point. And if this happens, look toward the finance sector — particularly the banks, like Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report), and the insurers, like Zacks Rank #2 firm Prudential (PRU  -  Free Report) and MetLife (MET  -  Free Report).

123,PRU,"MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report) recently announced its November operating business statistics. Insurance in force for the month was $193.5 billion, up 6.7% year over year. Delinquency loans (loans that failed to pay back) at the company declined on a year-over-year basis. Delinquent inventory for the month under review decreased 6.5% year over year to 46,900 loans.MGIC Investment was severely affected by the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company is steadily recovering on the back of declining delinquencies and improving cure rates on claims from its legacy business. The prospects of the company also look bright in terms of growing book of high-credit-quality business written since 2009.Given the continued improvement in new business written, fueled by larger origination volume as well as a rise in the private mortgage insurance industry’s market share, the company anticipates to write approximately the same amount of new insurance as 2016. New business written and an expected increase in persistency are anticipated to grow MGIC Investment’s insurance in force for the remainder of 2017.The company has been witnessing a decline in paid claims over a considerable period of time and the first nine months of 2017 were no exception. Hence, we expect paid claims to decrease further. Also, a decline in loss and claims will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and improve its financial profile.MGIC Investment estimates the number of loans in delinquent inventory as well as claim rate applied to new delinquent notices to decline in 2017. Moreover, based on premium rate changes, the company anticipates the claim rate for new notices to be lower in the future quarters.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementMGIC Investment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of the company have soared 50.9% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 11.0%. We expect decreasing claim payments, declining delinquencies owing to an improving housing market, new business as well as a robust capital position to continue driving shares higher in the near term.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in other stocks worth considering from the insurance industry can check out Radian Group Inc.

124,PRU,"Brown & Brown, Inc. (BRO  -  Free Report) has successfully catered to the growing and ever-changing demands of clients for years, building a robust product and service portfolio in turn. Retaining this optimism, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker continues to evolve stronger over time and looks set to repeat the success streak in the near future.Growth DriversBrown & Brown’s growth trajectory remains impressive, primarily driven by organic and inorganic means across all segments. Strategic buyouts coupled with mergers have enabled the company to expand operationally and we expect the insurance broker to continue investing in such initiatives that might accelerate the company’s overall growth.Interestingly, the company’s strategic efforts led to an increase in commission and fees over the past few years, resulting in substantial revenue growth.Moreover, the insurance broker has pinned its hopes on the new Core Commercial Program, which is anticipated to generate revenues ranging between $6 million and $8 million in the second half of 2017 along with a net P&L investment of $1-$3 million. Additionally, the company expects revenues to increase in 2018 and range between $15 million and $17 million with the net P&L investment of $2-$4 million. It is important to note that this program is still in the investment phase and is likely to leave an impact on the margins through 2019.This apart, a robust capital position has helped the company boost shareholder value via dividend increases and share buybacks. These shareholder-friendly moves continue to raise optimism among investors.Growth Projections: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share being pegged at $1.86 on revenues of $1.85 billion. While the top line reflects a year-over-year rise of 4.6%, the bottom line represents an increase of 0.2%. For 2018, the consensus mark for the metric stands at $2.00 on $1.92 billion revenues. While revenues represent a 4.1% improvement, earnings reflect 7.5% growth.An Outperformer: Shares of Brown & Brown have gained 6.9% quarter to date, outperforming the industry’s 2.3% increase. We expect the company’s sustained operational performance, higher commissions and fees plus a solid capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Attractive Valuation:  Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, valuation looks attractive at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 2.9, falling noticeably below the industry average of 4.4.Near-Term HeadwindsEscalating expenses, mainly due to higher compensation and operating expenses, continues to restrict the operating margin expansion. Moreover, the company does not expect a turnaround on this front anytime soon. Also, an unfavorable currency impact and an increased financial leverage raise concerns.  Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Radian Group Inc.

125,PRU,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has announced that it would sell its Talcott Resolution unit to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group.The deal worth $2.05 billion also involves an equity interest of Hartford Financial in the acquiring company that would allow it to participate in Talcott Resolution’s continued success. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and is presently subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.The company is assessing opportunities to deploy proceeds from the divesture. Presently, it expects to use around $400 million for debt repayment in addition to the $500 million it previously announced it would repay in 2018.This divestiture would complete its exit from the life and annuity business. The Talcott Resolution unit has remained a drag for quite some time owing to lowered earnings from divested businesses and continued run-off of the annuity block. Hartford Financial decided to offload annuities in 2012 after the business took a massive hit during the financial crisis. Continuing the previous trend, in the first nine months of 2017, the unit’s core earnings declined nearly 9.5% principally due to lower Limited Partnerships income and lower fee income with the runoff of the block.The divestiture would help the company to focus on growing market-leading core operations like Property and Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. Hartford Financial expects an improvement in its future return-on-equity, earnings performance and financial flexibility. It further expects to receive $300 million in a pre-closing dividend from Talcott Resolution that will reduce the level of its long-term debt by $143 million. However, the company estimates a GAAP after-tax net loss of about $3.2 billion from the sale of Talcott Resolution that is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.Year to date, shares of Hartford Financial have gained 18.6% while the Zacks Multi Line Insurance industry  rallied 11.2%. Management believes that the transaction would further instill shareholders’ confidence in the stock by boosting the company’s overall return-on-capital.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHartford Financial currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Radian Group Inc.

Post takeover, the company will continue to run its business from its current location.The latest buyout is expected to strengthen the already robust inorganic growth portfolio of the acquirer. Also, Weiss Insurance’s in-depth expertise and aforementioned services are anticipated to be highly value accretive to Arthur J. Gallagher’s client portfolio. With this buyout, the insurance broker will not only be able to improve its employee benefits consulting and brokerage operations but also grow its footprint in the Midwest region of the United States with better retail property/casualty brokerage services.Riding High on AcquisitionsOver the past few years, Arthur J. Gallagher’s impressive growth has been mainly fueled by organic sales as well as prudent acquisitions and mergers. To that end, the insurance broker has closed 27 acquisitions with annualized revenues of over $129.7 million in the first nine months of 2017. In addition, the company has put in substantial efforts to further accelerate its acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas with a goal to pursue smaller tuck-in mergers for the rest of 2017. Notably, Arthur J. Gallagher’s merger and acquisition pipeline remains strong with about $250 million of revenues.Such strategic initiatives will improve the company’s top line, resulting in the overall company’s growth. Additionally, the company’s brokerage segment has been witnessing excellent results over a considerable period of time.

128,PRU,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Prudential Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.40, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.52. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Prudential Financial’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 9.00 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.  Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance- Multi Line industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.21. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Prudential Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.37, so it is fair to say that a more value-oriented path for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Prudential Financial has a P/S ratio of about 0.84. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.18 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Prudential Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Prudential Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Prudential Financial is 1.22, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.38. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.14, better than the industry average of 7.06. Clearly, PRU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Prudential Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘F’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives PRU a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Further, the company’s recent earnings estimates have quite encouraging. The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision, while the next year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period.As a result, the current year consensus estimate has risen by 0.3% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has climbed 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteHowever, this positive trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the definite bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock’s growth story is intact.Bottom LinePrudential Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 28%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Further, over the past six months, the Zacks classified Insurance – Multi Line industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend                   Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy... Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

129,PRU,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.68%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterPrudential’s second-quarter earnings results are expected to have improved, banking on the strength of expanded product offerings, global presence and broader distribution capabilities.The top line is said to have likely improved on higher net investment income, increased improved asset management fees, commissions and other incomes.Strong account value growth is expected to have favored the company’s performance in the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management segment.Share buyback is also likely to have boosted the bottom line.Additionally, increase in higher total benefits and expenses possibly have weighed on margin expansion.With respect to the earnings trend, though the company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters, it came up with an average negative surprise of 1.88%.Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Prudential Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Prudential is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Prudential has an Earnings ESP of -0.37%.

130,PRU,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) has earned reputation in the Multi line insurance industry in the United States by meeting the expectations and ever-changing needs of its clients over a considerable period of time. Keeping its goodwill intact, the company offers a broad range of insurance, investment management and other financial products and services to its target market, building a solid product and service portfolio over the years.The Multi line insurer will continue to benefit from its reach and an in-depth expertise in the pension risk transfer (PRT) business. The company is also on track to establish a leadership position in the potentially strong PRT market, suitable to mobilize the insurance company’s skills in the management of group annuity.The company’s international operations too have positioned it well for long-term growth. It is expected to benefit from the AFP Habitat buyout, completed in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction, expanding its international footprint, is estimated to result in stable growth, steady earnings and an adequate cash flow generation. Therefore, the company remains focused on diversifying its activities to enable it to accelerate overall growth and leave a positive impact on the same in the near term.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Multi line insurer has successfully generated investors’ value by implementing some shareholder-friendly measures such as, dividend payments and share repurchases, over time. It has been approved of to buy back worth $1.25 billion shares in 2017. The company remains committed toward maintaining a solid capital and liquidity position, thereby protecting itself from market volatility.However, an unfavorable currency impact and regulatory control remain headwinds. In addition, rising expenses have been raising concerns for the insurer and it does not expect a turnaround in the immediate term.Shares of Prudential Financial have gained 7.06% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Multi line Insurance industry’s increase of 6.31%. We expect the company’s sustained operational performance, improving asset under management and a robust capital position to drive the stock higher in the near term.Notably, valuation is attractive at present as the stock is currently trading at a price to book multiple of 1.02 over a period of one year, a 21.5% discount to the industry average of 1.30.Besides, the company has a trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 8.5%, higher than the industry’s 6.9% average. Furthermore, the company’s expected long-term earnings growth is pegged at 8.50%.Prudential Financial is set to release its second-quarter results on Aug 2. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP an Earnings ESP of -0.37% makes prediction difficult.        Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA  -  Free Report), Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group, Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reinsurance Group deals in reinsurance business.

131,PRU,"The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is by far the most widely used metric in the value investing world due to its simplicity. Many prefer to take the P/E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at attractive prices. But even this ubiquitously used equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations.Is EV/EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E?While P/E is the most commonly used tool for evaluating a firm’s value, another valuation metric called EV/EBITDA works even better. The ratio is often viewed as a better alternative to P/E as it offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA determines the total value of a company while P/E solely considers its equity portion.EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. Simply put, it is the total value of a firm.The other component of the ratio, EBITDA is a true reflection of a company’s profitability as it strips out non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the better it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued.However, unlike P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet. For this reason, EV/EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates.Another limitation of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making entity. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV/EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV/EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.Then again, EV/EBITDA has its flaws too. It varies across industries (a high-growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa) and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Thus, instead of just relying on EV/EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to achieve the desired results. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 16 stocks that passed the screen:SORL Auto Parts, Inc. (SORL  -  Free Report) specializes in the development, production and distribution of air brake valves and hydraulic brake valves. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has an expected year-over-year earnings growth rate of 58% for 2017.

136,PRU,"The insurance industry grabbed the spotlight in recent times in the wake of the terrifying hurricanes hitting the United States this year. Per catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates for Hurricane Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion for Hurricane Maria. Other parts of the world also have not been spared their share of nature’s horrors, with Mexico facing the wrath of two successive earthquakes recently.Such huge payouts are likely to hit the bottom lines of insurers grievously. But it’s not all gloom and doom for the sector with the stage set for the Fed to tighten rates. Despite the Fed’s reluctance to raise interest rates at its September meeting, rates have continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace, courtesy of the three hikes made since December 2016. Investment income has also markedly improved from historical lows. (Read: 4 Insurance Stocks to Dodge as Q3 Earnings Season Kicks Off)With sector majors Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) both scheduled to report on Nov 1, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. While MetLife has a Zacks #3 (Hold), Prudential has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled during this week include Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Price PerformanceDespite recent hiccups, the broader industry has turned in a creditable performance over the last one year, gaining 27.5%. Meanwhile, Prudential has gained 32.6% over the same period, outperforming the Zacks Multi-Line Insurance industry as well as MetLife, which has increased 15.3%.ValuationDue to the various difficulties related to valuing insurance companies, the Price to Book ratio is the preferred metric for the industry. Problems involving valuation include the lack of clarity surrounding debt levels and the near absence of depreciation and capital expenditure. Instead, book value is utilized which includes the value of stocks, bonds and other securities which provide a fairer representation of value since active markets for them exist.Coming to the two insurance heavyweights, both Metlife and Prudential are undervalued relative to the broader industry, which has a P/B value of 1.46. However, MetLife holds the edge here, with a lower P/B value of 0.82 compared to Prudential’s value of 0.98.Return on EquityThis metric is appropriate when the goal is to compare the profitability of companies that belong to the same industry. In the case of insurers, Return on Equity or ROE gauges the amount of income generated as a percentage value of the shareholders equity. An increase in ROE levels is an indicator of the effective use of invested capital, since the return on such capital has increased.Here, both Prudential and MetLife have higher ROE values than the broader industry for which the metric stands at 7.7%. But Prudential clearly wins this round with an ROE value of nearly 9% which outperforms MetLife’s ROE of 8.5%.Debt to EquityThis is comprehensive leverage metric, utilized to measure the financial health of companies within the same industry. Insurers are primarily funded by investors, customers as well as corporate debt holders. This is why their capital structure is strikingly different from other sectors which produce goods or are engaged in offering other kinds of services.MetLife and Prudential both have D/E ratios lower than the broader industry, for which the value comes in at 47.6%. However, MetLife probably has a lower level of associated risk, given that its D/E ratio of 34.7% is lower than Prudential’s level of 39.9%. Dividend YieldBoth Prudential and MetLife have offered a superior dividend yield over the last one year period compared to the broader industry, which has returned 1.8% over this period. However, with a dividend yield of 3%, MetLife is ahead of Prudential on this count, but only just, since Merck has offered a dividend yield of 2.7% over the same period.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, MetLife has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of +7.4%. In comparison, Prudential delivered earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of -1%. But this figure is primarily attributable to last quarter’s negative earnings surprise of 22.59%. Since then, the company has expanded product offerings and broadened its distribution capabilities, factors which are likely to benefit Prudential’s third-quarter results.When considering Earnings ESP, however, Prudential is a clear winner. With an ESP of 0%, MetLife is at a disadvantage, since Prudential holds a value of +0.0.7%. Additionally, Prudential’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased by 0.4% over the last 30 days, while MetLife’s value has declined by 3.5% over the same period. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that MetLife holds an edge over Prudential when considering a more comprehensive earnings history as well as in the case of Price to Book and Debt to Equity values. It also holds a slight advantage on the dividend front. However, when considering price performance, estimate revisions and Return on Equity values, Prudential is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Prudential at this point in time is its superior Zacks Rank #2, compared to MetLife’s Zacks Rank #3. Additionally, it sports a superior ESP value of +0.07%, compared to MetLife’s reading of 0%. This is why it may be better to bet on Prudential over MetLife as they prepare to report earnings.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

137,PRU,"CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, before the market opens. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last two quarters. Let’s see what it has in store for this yet-to-be reported quarter.Being a property and casualty (P&C) insurer, CNA Financial has likely incurred higher catastrophe losses, significantly, due to the unprecedented hurricane activity occurring during the third quarter. This in turn will affect the company’s underwriting profitability, rendering volatility to the P&C insurer’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for  third-quarter 2017 is currently pegged at 27 cents, reflecting a noticeable plunge of 76.5% from the year-ago quarter.  Despite the P&C insurer’s impressive track record of maintaining the combined ratio at favorable levels, the company has likely experienced deterioration in the same, in the soon-to-be-reported quarter due to high level of catastrophe losses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio is currently pegged at 95%, representing a deterioration of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis.Further, the company might have incurred higher expenses, primarily due to increasing net incurred claims and benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs. This rise in expenses is likely to restrict the operating margin expansion, which might hurt the company’s overall profitability.Nonetheless, net premiums earned have likely increased in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, driven by an improvement in new business as well as a solid retention. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is currently pegged at $1.8 billion, reflecting a substantial increase of 8.1% from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, with the rising interest rate environment, the P&C insurer has likely reported higher net investment income. Also, improved limited partnership returns have likely contributed to the increase in investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is currently pegged at $505 million, denoting a surge of 36.1% on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CNA Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.
