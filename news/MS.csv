0,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) on Tuesday said that first-quarter trading revenue was likely to rise in the ""mid- to high single digits,"" with this month's stock plunge offering the kind of jolt that helps trading desks reap more in sales.XIf it holds, the forecast, made at the bank's investor day, could bode well for other banks, which are coming off a 2017 that lacked the absence of Trumpian or Brexit-like shocks that caused greater client activity and market turnover.Banks over the past year have cited muted market volatility as a reason for weaker trading revenue.Shares closed down 1.2% at 117.36 on the stock market today. Bank of America (BAC) dipped 0.3% while Citigroup (C) lost 1.6%.Goldman Sachs (GS), which has tried to rebound from months of trading missteps, eased 1.2%. Morgan Stanley (MS) edged down 0.5%.

1,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) is a ""safe"" large-cap biotech to own in 2018, an analyst said Thursday after the firm issued bullish full-year guidance and topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, though adjusted profit lagged expectations and shares were up only slightly.X Still, investors have yet to fully grasp future competitive dynamics surrounding Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS)-partnered spinal muscular atrophy drug, Spinraza, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.""Overall, nothing in the quarter that we see changes the perception of Biogen as a 'safe' large-cap name to own in 2018, though we do believe potential longer-term MS and SMA competition may be underappreciated,"" he said.In the fourth quarter, Biogen brought in $3.31 billion in total sales and adjusted profit of $5.26 per share, up a respective 15% and 4% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts had seen revenue of $3.07 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.44 a share.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond blamed the earnings miss on a 29-cent impact related to an impairment charge Biogen had to take on multiple sclerosis drug Zinbryta.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen has a high IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a best-possible 99. This means it performs in the top 10% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still isn't ranked first in the biotech group. To see which stock does, visit IBD Stock Checkup.For the year, Biogen guided to $12.7 billion to $13 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $24.20-$25.20 a share. Both metrics easily topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $12.66 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $23.86 per share.Guidance suggests Biogen has ""room for additional growth in 2018,"" RBC's Abrahams said.""We believe (this) will drive continued perception of Biogen as a lower-risk large-cap name for 2018,"" he said. ""Margin guidance was generally in line with expectations, though tax rate will be slightly higher than we had modeled.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen gained 2.1% to close at 353.74.Total Spinraza sales of $363 million beat consensus views of $326 to $332 million, according to analysts with Instinet and Leerink. U.S. sales of $218 million were just above expectations for $216 million, Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said in a report.Outside the U.S., Spinraza brought in $144 million in sales, which topped the Street view for $110 million, Marai said. In international markets, the lion's share of growth came from Germany, Turkey and Japan.That's where RBC's Abrahams sees near-term growth for Spinraza. When patients first go on Spinraza, they receive four loading doses with maintenance doses administered every four months following — meaning in the first year of treatment patients receive six doses.Spinraza was approved in the U.S. in December 2016. Many patients are now receiving the maintenance dose every four months.""U.S. sales continue to show lower growth potential as patients convert from loading to maintenance doses and new patient starts decline quarter-over-quarter, a dynamic we believe may still be underappreciated for some,"" he said.Biogen and Ionis are also facing a potential competitor in the future from AveXis (AVXS), which is working on a gene therapy known as AVXS-101, to treat some types of spinal muscular atrophy.Biogen's multiple sclerosis portfolio brought in combined sales of $2.22 billion, 2% higher than the consensus view for $2.17 billion, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. The biggest outlier was Tysabri, which brought in $463 million in sales, beating views by 4%.Tecfidera, Biogen's biggest multiple sclerosis drug, grew 7% to $1.08 billion and beat analysts' collective view by 3%, Porges said. But this number was somewhat tempered by the fact that the fourth quarter was helped by a $20 million inventory build, Piper Jaffray's Raymond said.So far, Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise isn't suffering from the launch of Roche's (RHHBY) Ocrevus, RBC's Abrahams said. Ocrevus is unique in that it's approved to treat relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Most drugs are just approved to treat the relapsing form.In the near future, Porges expects competitive launches to pressure Biogen's multiple sclerosis unit. Novartis (NVS) will lose exclusivity on Gilenya in 2019, meaning generics will come into play. Celgene (CELG) is also expected to have a new drug, ozanimod, in 2018.RELATED:Why Valeant's 162% Climb Over Nine Months 'Makes No Sense'Abbott Spikes To Record After Topping Quarterly ExpectationsNovartis Tops A High After Crushing Fourth-Quarter Expectations

4,MS,"When it comes to the issue of porn star Stormy Daniels, we should welcome the media and the Democrats' newfound interest in the treatment — and mistreatment — of women by powerful political figures.Never mind that whatever relationship Daniels had with President Donald Trump was consensual and ended a decade ago. Nor that there doesn't appear to be any evidence that Trump broke any campaign law regarding the apparent $130K ""keep quiet"" settlement reached only days before the election. Poor Ms. Daniels — the value of salacious stuff about Trump has skyrocketed now that he is president, so Daniels wants out of the nondisclosure agreement that she willingly signed. She sold cheap, and now wants more.Even if no laws were broken, the Dems and the media insist that, well, it's the optics. This just looks bad. As one CNN pundit/Democratic strategist put it, ""Paying off a porn star is presidential?""Democrats rate President John F. Kennedy one of the country's best presidents. Kennedy's popularity remains despite the revelations of his reckless and dangerous sexual misbehavior during his presidency. The Democratic icon partied with hookers at the White House and bedded a mobster's girlfriend. The Chicago Tribune's Joan Beck, in a column, discussed ""The Dark Side of Camelot,"" a Jack Kennedy expose by former New York Times investigative reporter Seymour Hersh. Beck wrote:""Many of the charges in 'The Dark Side of Camelot' are now familiar: Joseph Kennedy stole the 1960 election for his son. JFK used the Secret Service to sneak women into the White House when Jackie was away. He botched the invasion of Cuba, leaving brave men to die while he played games of political expediency. He repeatedly tried to have Fidel Castro assassinated. He took huge doses of amphetamines regularly from a feel-good doctor who later lost his license.""Some of Hersh's accusations are less familiar: Kennedy suffered from venereal disease for 30 years, apparently infecting and being re-infected by the prostitutes and starlets he used to satisfy his insatiable appetite for sex. ... A threat of sexual blackmail had to be defused by giving a $6.5 billion defense contract to General Dynamics. ...""'In private, Kennedy was consumed with almost daily sexual liaisons and libertine partying, to a degree that shocked many members of his personal Secret Service detail,' writes Hersh. 'The sheer number of Kennedy's sexual partners and the recklessness of his use of them, escalated throughout his presidency.'""About Bobby Kennedy, his friend Richard Goodwin said it was a ""Kennedy family tradition"" to philander, but that Bobby was ""much more selective and limited"" compared to older brother John.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The fellow did have a legitimate job, she says, but also openly bragged of his prowess at getting attractive and beddable dates for his boss.""GQ also detailed one incident in a restaurant's private room: ""As (waitress Carla) Gaviglio enters the room, the six-foot-two, 225-plus-pound Kennedy grabs the five-foot-three, 103-pound waitress and throws her on the table. She lands on her back, scattering crystal, plates and cutlery and the lit candles. Several glasses and a crystal candlestick are broken. Kennedy then picks her up from the table and throws her on (drinking buddy Sen. Christopher) Dodd, who is sprawled in a chair. With Gaviglio on Dodd's lap, Kennedy jumps on top and begins rubbing his genital area against hers, supporting his weight on the arms of the chair. As he is doing this, (waitress Betty) Loh enters the room. She and Gaviglio both scream, drawing one or two dishwashers. Startled, Kennedy leaps up. He laughs. Bruised, shaken and angry over what she considered a sexual assault, Gaviglio runs from the room.""As to President Bill Clinton, the late British left-wing writer Christopher Hitchens, in ""No One Left to Lie To,"" claimed that three women have made ""plausible"" allegations of rape by Bill Clinton.Juanita Broaddrick, on ""Dateline NBC,"" claimed that Clinton, then-Arkansas attorney general and gubernatorial candidate, raped her. She further alleges that Hillary Clinton, shortly after the alleged rape, verbally intimidated her, implying that Broaddrick better keep her mouth shut — or else. At a political event two weeks later, Broaddrick claims that Hillary approached her: ""She came over to me, took ahold of my hand and said, 'I've heard so much about you and I've been dying to meet you. ... I just want you to know how much that Bill and I appreciate what you do for him.' ... (Hillary Clinton) took ahold of my hand and squeezed it and said, 'Do you understand? Everything that you do.'""To paraphrase, rape is presidential?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

5,MS,"Trump Dossier: With each new revelation, a picture of the Russian scandal emerges: Not only were Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee up to their necks in collusion with Russians to undermine then-candidate Donald Trump, but President Obama was in on the action, too. Is this where collusion becomes conspiracy?X
"
6,MS,"See if this sounds familiar: Democratic presidential campaign pays international law firm Perkins Coie, which then turns around and pays left-wing opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on the campaign's political opponent.Sounds just like what Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee did in 2016, right?In fact, Hillary was a Janey-come-lately to that ploy. Obama did it first in 2012. Using his Obama for America campaign front, Obama paid Perkins Coie close to a million dollars, which was reportedly used to pay — who else — Fusion GPS to find salacious stuff about Obama's foe in the 2012 election, the ultra-square Mitt Romney.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut, according to a new book by progressive journalists Michael Isikoff and David Corn, ""Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and Donald Trump's Election,"" not only did Fusion do opposition research, something every campaign does, it also did aggressively hostile opposition donor research.""In 2012, then-President Obama had an 'enemies list' on his campaign website with the names of Mitt Romney's biggest donors,"" noted PJ Media's Debra Heine.That enemies list was placed on the Obama campaign's Orwellian ""Truth Team"" web site. The site called them a ""group of wealthy individuals with less-than-reputable records. Quite a few have been on the wrong side of the law, others have made profits at the expense of so many Americans...""That kind of vilification of decent, law-abiding, successful Americans is bad enough. But to drive home the intimidation, each of the names on the list was subsequently tweeted out from the @TruthTeam2012 twitter feed, along with their supposed misdeeds, most of which really amounted merely to tough or unpopular business decisions they had to make.Obama ""relied on a vast grassroots network to coerce, bully, boycott and vilify individuals lawfully taking part in the political process, just as his own donors and supporter are freely allowed to engage,"" wrote the Daily Signal back in 2012.Imagine for a moment the chilling effect that would have on a political foe's campaign — calling those who fund another campaign's candidate ""enemies,"" with all that entails. The IRS, the SEC, the FBI, the Justice Department, all with active prosecution arms, all headed by Obama loyalists. To say it's an act of political and personal intimidation is an understatement.Obama's fingerprints go beyond that, however.The Isikoff-Corn book suggests that the infamous relationship between former British spy Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS and the FBI  was forged by Obama officials at the State Department — in particular former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, who gave permission to the FBI to talk to Steele in London, and former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Winer, who ""worked as a middleman to bring Mr. Steele together with Sidney Blumenthal, a fierce Hillary Clinton defender. Mr. Winer spoke with Ms. Nuland, who gave a heads up to Secretary of State John Kerry.""How much do you want to bet that Kerry, a cabinet member, reported all this to former President Obama?By the way, both Nuland and Winer worked for Clinton at the State Department, and both have since left. And the notorious Trump dossier that resulted from putting Steele together with the FBI, Fusion and the Clinton campaign led to a wiretap of the Trump campaign and also now serves as the centerpiece of a year-and-a-half long Mueller investigation into Trump — one that has now spilled over its boundaries, looking into things that have nothing to do with Russian meddling in the 2016 election.The genius of it all is that, at the same time they were using spurious Russian contacts to smear Trump's name, they were also launching the FBI investigation into phony allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians in 2016. The only collusion, in short, was between the Clinton campaign, Steele and the Russians.But what we now see clearly is this entire scheme wasn't just cooked up by a Nixonian Hillary Clinton, trying her best to destroy her political foe. No, it was part of a pattern set by President Obama and copied by his able student, Hillary. The Obama-adoring media knew what Obama had done in 2012, but barely bothered to report at the time.This goes beyond mere creepy political collusion, or dirty campaign capers. It suggests a broader Democratic scheme to use government resources to hamstring opposition political campaigns and, now, to destroy a presidency.And this conspiracy spans two presidential campaign cycles and two separate opposition presidential candidates, using remarkably similar tactics and even the same law firm and research operation. With a number of government officials knowingly involved, this, in short, reeks of conspiracy to subvert the election process.You Might Also Like:Will Mueller Ever Admit That There Was No Trump-Russia Collusion?Russia-Trump Investigation: How Did Hillary Clinton Get FBI, FISA To Do Her Political Dirty Work?Why No Investigation Into FBI, Justice Dept.

Start NowOn Thursday, President Trump's afternoon meeting on tariffs hung over the market but eventually led to a 15-minute rally into the close. Gains were restrained, suggesting the tariff flap isn't settled. The reaction of other nations is not yet clear.Still, those worries faded to the background Friday morning on the shockingly strong payroll data. The Street estimated payroll data would come in at 205,000 in February, according to Econoday. The figure rolled in at 313,000, which was 36% above the highest estimate in the range. Also, the January reading of 200,000 was revised upward to 239,000.The workforce participation rate was pegged at 63% vs. the prior 62.7%. The increase from still low participation levels suggested that wage growth may not be an inflationary problem for a while.Bulls might now detect a Goldilocks economy, growth that is neither too hot nor too cold to worry either the Street or the Federal Reserve.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, oil, chips and leisure scored nice gains. Toys and retail lagged.Blue chips were mostly up with 10 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average rising 1% or more. Intel scored a 2% gain and marked a new high. Intel's weekly gain is shaping up at 2.5%. Apple popped 1%, turning modestly higher for the week.Railroad stock Kansas City Southern (KSU) surged 2% as it retook its 50-day line.

9,MS,"Stocks were still poised to cap a big weekly decline but bargain hunters stepped in during a late-afternoon rebound amid a sharp slide in crude oil prices and not much change in long-term interest rates. However, it's still too early to declare the correction over.X At 3:45 p.m. ET, major indexes accelerated their rebound, rising 1.5% to 1.7% after plunging nearly 2% earlier in the session.The S&P 500, rebounding from a loss of as much as 1.8%, fought its way back to hop above the breakeven level around 2 p.m. ET and rally as much as 1.8% higher. But the 500 is still on track to post one of its worst weekly declines (down more than 5%) over the past two decades.At one point on Friday, the Nasdaq composite fell as much as 8.4% for the week, bigger than the nearly 8% slide seen during the ""Flash Crash"" week ended on May 7, 2010, and an 8.1% walloping during the week ended Aug. 5, 2011.The S&P 500, meanwhile, is probing longer-term support at the 200-day moving average, which it undercut on Friday for the first time since the Brexit shock of late June in 2016.After that swift decline back then, the S&P 500 staged a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, confirming a potential new uptrend was in place. That market-timing signal indeed proved that stocks were ready to rumble higher.Please check out this Investor's Corner to learn more about how a follow-through is a research-driven, time-proven indicator of major market bottoms. In a few rare cases, a new uptrend may take place before a typical follow-through triggers, as seen in November 2016, just ahead of the historic U.S. elections.The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.7% after sinking 1.6% earlier in the session. At 899, the 600 is still eyeing a weekly decline of nearly 4.8%, yet as a daily chart on MarketSmith shows, the index is showing a nice undercut of and rally back above the key 200-day moving average.In general, a healthy stock market uptrend shows the major indexes rising above both their 50- and 200-day moving averages. The slope of both moving averages should also be up.The strength of the rebound by the 500 suggests that short covering, algorithmic buying triggered by the S&P 500's touch of the 200-day moving average, and old fashioned bargain hunting all helped improve the mood on Wall Street. Plus, one has to consider that margin debt growth hasn't really increased at a rate seen in prior major market tops. See IBD's graph on this sentiment indicator by going to the Psychological Market Indicators section on Investors.com.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is losing support at the long-term 200-day moving average with a more than 1% drop to 153.29, sinking nearly 16% below its all-time peak of 180.10. Such a decline now exceeds the maximum correction allowed for a flat base and sets the stock up for a potential new base including the cup with handle or the double bottom.Apple has given back all the gains from a Sept. 27 breakout past a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97. However, gains from the Jan. 6, 2017, breakout from a first-stage bottoming base pattern are still hefty at 30.7%. That bottoming base was an excellent cup with handle that provided a 118.12 entry point, 10 cents above the handle's intraday high.Other stocks that show relative strength but have fallen back below their latest buy points may produce the base on base, another bullish chart pattern that often precedes big breakouts and price runs in a healthy bull market.Yet for now, the market appears it will need some time before it confirms a new uptrend after Wall Street gets a sense of how fast U.S. interest rates could rise this year.The Federal Reserve pushed the fed funds rate by a quarter point to a target range of 1.25%-1.5% in December, still a low level compared with prior decades. Bond futures traders expect the U.S. central bank to raise short-term interest rates at least three more times in 2018, targeting 2%-2.25% by December.As many as 12 of the 30 components in the Dow had lost 2 points or more. Buying in defensive sectors had earlier helped blunt the S&P 500's decline.Some leading tech names also are holding up well. Nvidia (NVDA), the top chip technology firm in advanced processors for datacenter, self-driving cars and video game consoles, also traded wildly but still rose more than 5% to 230.16 in volume running nearly triple usual levels.The Santa Clara, Calif., firm late Thursday posted exceptional increases in the top and bottom lines again as earnings grew 59% to $1.57 a share and revenue lifted 34% to $2.91 billion, a quarterly best.Those increases came on top of a 183% leap in adjusted earnings and a 55% rise in revenue in the year-ago quarter.Nvidia also is an emerging force in products related to artificial intelligence and Bitcoin mining.On Jan. 8, the stock broke out of an eight-week cup base with a 218.77 buy point. Nvidia tested the buy point with a sharp decline on Monday, but it found institutional buying support at the 50-day moving average (painted in red on IBD daily charts). At 5% above the proper entry, Nvidia is slightly out of buy range.The large-cap fabless semiconductor play sports a 95 Relative Price Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an excellent Composite Rating of 97. A 95 RS Rating means Nvidia has outperformed 95% of all public companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Elsewhere, the Dow Jones utility average rebounded 0.8%. WTI crude oil futures dipped below the $60 level for the first time in 2018, falling as much as 5% to $58.07 a barrel. WTI futures have now fallen as much as 12% below its year-to-date peak of $66.14.The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond stayed relatively flat at 2.82%, 77 basis points above the 2-year note yield of 2.05% and 117 basis points above 3-month Treasury bills. But Tradeweb noted that the U.S. yield curve has begun to get steeper at both the front and back ends.A steepening curve is good news for banks that derive much interest-related income.Banks are also rebounding, and a fistful of names have not fallen as much as the major indexes.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a member of the 30-stock Dow industrial average, has reversed from a drop of more than 1% to a 2.3% rise to 110.42. Volume is running more than 50% above its 50-day average, a good sign of healthy institutional buying.The money center bank has been testing the 50-day moving average the entire week. Shares lie 8% below the all-time peak of 117.35, while the S&P 500 is 11% below its peak of 2872.JPMorgan analysts reportedly expect eight rate hikes by the end of 2019.Morgan Stanley (MS) has dropped further below the 50-day line with a more than 3% slide to just above 50, but it too has turned higher for a minor gain. The asset manager and investment banking giant had come just within 2 points from testing its longer-term 200-day moving average.The veteran Wall Street firm has posted solid EPS increases of 14% to 135% over the past six quarters as revenue grew 11% to 27%. The Street sees Q1 profit jumping 23% to $1.23 a share, which is impressive given that in the year-ago quarter, profit soared 82% to $1.00 a share.Not all of the top industry groups in the market came from defensive sectors. In fact, fabless semiconductor, leisure products, superregional bank, security software, shoe maker, automobile retail and internet content firms all rallied 1.5% or more in late-afternoon trading.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, and financial markets.)RELATED:Is It Possible To Make A Million Dollars With ETFs?

But given the enormous stakes involved it was necessary, and California deserves to lose, big time.X ""California, we have a problem,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech Wednesday. ""Here's my message — how dare you. How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical, open borders agenda.""Bingo.California's Democratic Party has moved so far to the left of the political spectrum, it can no longer be considered a mainstream party.

11,MS,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowDemocrats — California is essentially a one-party state — recently passed three laws that they knew seriously conflicted with federal laws, but were nonetheless favored by the extreme open borders advocates among the Democrats.The laws, together, make it a crime for businesses to voluntarily aid federal agents in nabbing undocumented workers; keep California law enforcement officers from telling federal agents when illegal immigrant detainees are released from jail, prison or other custody; and create special state inspections for federal immigration detention facilities.Let's be clear: Whatever your views on immigration, California's actions are plainly illegal. The Constitution gives the federal government control over our borders and immigration, part of its duty to defend the U.S. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, meanwhile, establishes federal law as ""the supreme law of the land.""This is a federal-state crisis, and deserves to be treated as such. Unfortunately, California's top politicians treat their law-breaking as a joke.""At a time of unprecedented political turmoil, Jeff Sessions has come to California to further divide and polarize America,"" said California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""Jeff, these political stunts may be the norm in Washington, but they don't work here. SAD!!!""California's State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, though somewhat more serious, bizarrely claimed that ""public safety"" enabled him to defy federal law. And he put forth the entirely erroneous legal theory that state law trumps federal law.""No matter what happens in Washington, California will stay the course and enforce all our laws and protect our people,"" he said. ""That's how we keep our communities safe.""This is more than just another joke about loony, screw-loose California politicians. Laugh if you will, but California has 38 million people, about 12% of the nation's total. It has at least 2.5 million illegal immigrants, or about 21% of the official U.S. total (some believe the number is far larger). It also has about a third of the nation's welfare recipients. As such, California's policies have an enormous impact on other states.One need only look at the tragic example of the murderous Salvadorean MS-13 gang, which began in Los Angeles but now has spread mayhem, murder and drug addiction across the U.S. This isn't an argument between California and the federal government; it's really an argument between California and the other 49 states.Just last weekend, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned illegal immigrant criminals in her city of an impending ICE operation. About half of those that ICE picked up had criminal records, including a variety of violent crimes. But hundreds of criminal illegals escaped, free to rob, rape and assault again, thanks to Schaaf. Oakland's mayor may think herself a heroine, but she's now guilty of a felony.It's ironic that impeccably progressive, far-left California seems to be following the Confederacy down the road to asserting a state's right of ""nullification"" of federal laws. Recall that it was this very same nonexistent ""right"" that southern states asserted in the 1800s to defy the federal government on tariffs and slavery, and again in the 1950s to ignore desegregation laws passed by the federal government. Those did not end well for the states involved.Indeed, progressives, since the founding of their movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century, have ardently advocated and argued for the idea that the federal government should have supreme power. Suddenly, now, they're neo-Confederates. When laws don't suit them, the descendants of those early progressives simply reverse the argument. Don't like a law? Ignore it and write your own.""There is no nullification. There is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land. I would invite any doubters to go to Gettysburg, to the tombstones of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln. This matter has been settled,"" said Sessions in his speech Wednesday.The federal government can't look away. Those who flout the law must be punished with fines, federal aid penalties and, if need be, prison terms. This is not a game. Letting the once-Golden State slide would be an invitation to other states to ignore the Constitution and our nation's laws. It would be an invitation to chaos and, eventually, the dissolution of the U.S.For now, this will make its way through the courts, a tortuous process that can take years. In the interim, we would hope that those who are knowingly breaking the law would be arrested and tried for it. If our elected officials won't respect the law, why should anyone else?You might also like...Trump's Grand Immigration Bargain: Either Take Border Security Seriously, Or No Deal On 'Dreamers'Can Trump Win His Fight Against Leftist Judges And Open-Border Radicals Over Immigration?California: Golden No MoreClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

12,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) and AbbVie (ABBV) announced Friday they are pulling their jointly developed multiple sclerosis drug Zinbryta from the market following reports of brain inflammation in patients using the medication.X RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said the decision will have ""zero material impact"" on Biogen as Zinbryta was expected to bring in about $400 million in 2027 revenue for the company, or less than 3% of total sales.""Zinbryta is not one of Biogen's core MS drugs and has been a very marginal contributor since its mid-2016 U.S. approval, due to a benefit/risk profile that even before today's new adverse events reports had skewed unfavorably,"" Abrahams said in a note to clients.The analyst noted Zinbryta is tied to liver toxicity, inflammatory/immune toxicity and cases of hypersensitivity.There are ""a number of better options for the disease,"" he said. Biogen has a suite of multiple sclerosis drugs.The decision to pull Zinbryta followed cases of encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, and meningoencephalitis, which simultaneously resembles meningitis and encephalitis, he said.On the stock market today, Biogen gained 1.6% to close at 286.96, while AbbVie lifted 1.1% to finish the regular session at 115.04.

14,MS,"New Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that he sees ""at most modest risk"" from high asset prices, despite the generally buoyant stock market. But investors sold shares on concerns that Powell and fellow policymakers will raise interest rates more than three times in 2018 due to stepped-up economic growth forecasts.Asked whether low interest rates have fueled ""dangerous risk-taking,"" Powell noted no real build-up of leverage among households or the emergence of other significant risks to financial stability.Wall Street reacted somewhat negatively to Powell's first monetary policy testimony to Congress since taking the helm of the U.S. central bank, focusing on his outlook for stronger economic growth and what that might mean for the number of Fed rate hikes in 2018.Yet the overall tenor of his testimony probably should be taken as positive, because it suggests a lack of urgency to raise interest rates. The Fed, in other words, remains data-dependent and won't move to tighten policy more quickly due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus unless inflation gathers momentum. On the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at session lows, down more than 1%.Bank stocks fell somewhat amid the broad sell-off. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost a fraction, though JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were down 1% or more. Banks can reap higher net interest margins as interest rates rise, especially when the long-term yields rise more than short-term yields.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.90%, off session peaks but not far off last week's four-year high of 2.95%.""At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018,"" Powell said in response to a question over what it would take for the Fed to hike rates more than three times this year. ""Now since then — we will submit another projection, all of us, in three weeks  — but since then, what we've seen is incoming data that suggests that strengthening in the economy. We've seen continuing strength in the labor market. We've seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target. We've also seen continued strength around the globe, and we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate paths as we go into the March meeting.""Powell added that it was his ""personal outlook"" as well as the overall committee that ""the economy has strengthened since December,"" when Fed policymakers last offered their economic and policy projections for 2018.Powell's upgrading of the outlook is hardly a surprise, coming after Congress backed a $300-billion-plus increase in federal spending earlier in February. Even before that, some Fed policymakers had been marking up their economic projections, as noted in the minutes from their Jan. 30-31 meeting.Asked about whether ""profligate fiscal policy"" might require higher interest rates than otherwise by a Democratic committee member, Powell said that the Fed will keep its on eye on the economy, not on the actions of Congress, but he allowed that ""all things equal,"" the appropriate interest rate would be higher when fiscal policy becomes more stimulative.The Q&A seemed to cancel out the seemingly positive reaction to his published testimony. In prepared remarks released before the market open, Powell said that the Fed policymaking committee sees the risks to the economy as balanced between upside and downside risks, even as ""some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,"" especially fiscal policy.The takeaway from the Q&A is that the assessment of balanced risks might date back to the January meeting, before the latest fiscal stimulus.Yet in discussing a possibility that the Fed might discuss adopting an inflation range, instead of its specific 2% target, as a guide for policy, Powell underscored that there's not much reason to worry about an upsurge in inflation.""Generally speaking inflation has been low or stable for 15 years now,"" Powell said.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Indeed, core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures price index, hasn't touched 2.5% since 1995. The past two economic expansions weren't tripped up by the Fed having to tamp down an inflation outbreak, but by the bursting of the dot-com and housing bubbles.So when Powell expresses confidence that few troubling signs of excess have emerged, as well as confidence about a stable inflation outlook, investors should see the potential for this economic expansion running for several more years.In prepared testimony, Powell said, ""In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis.""Powell's testimony comes as firms including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are predicting one more rate hike this year than the Fed's own policymakers projected in December. Passage of a $310 billion budget deal in early February, after the Fed's last meeting, also has led economists to mark up their GDP growth estimates and added to concerns that inflation could make a comeback.Inflation and the risk of a hawkish Fed has come back on the radar of investors after the January jobs report showed average hourly wages growing 2.9% from a year ago, up from the Goldilocks readings near 2.5% that persisted in 2017.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, saying they would spend part of their tax windfall on higher compensation, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Although a faster pace of rate hikes can't be ruled out if wage gains and inflation exhibit momentum, Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed isn't predisposed to a faster pace of rate hikes and will continue to give the economy some running room.Arguably, financial markets are leading the Fed and not the other way around. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a four-year high last week after the Fed minutes from the January meeting noted that ""a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

15,MS,"Record stock markets have been good to Morgan Stanley (MS).The firm's wealth-management fees climbed to a record in the fourth quarter as the S&P 500 Index reached an all-time high. The company beat its target cost ratio for the year and posted the highest profitability under Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, who has pinned his strategy on the crisis-era acquisition of Citigroup's (C) Smith Barney brokerage. The shares rose as the company boosted its target for return on equity.X Morgan Stanley has been moving more wealthy clients into fee-based accounts that are priced on asset levels rather than activity, boosting results as markets rise. Revenue from wealth management moved closer to parity with the institutional-securities business than at any point since 2013.Wealth management has ""only increased in relevance as it's continued to grow,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said in an interview. ""It's a larger and larger contribution of our earnings, which is a good thing given the stability"" and high returns of the business, he said.The gains helped offset debt-trading results that were stung by the same malaise afflicting all of Wall Street. Fourth-quarter fixed-income revenue tumbled 45 percent to $808 million, missing the $1.03 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equities-trading revenue declined 2 percent to $1.92 billion, compared with the $1.89 billion estimate. Morgan Stanley is Wall Street's leading stock-trading shop by revenue.For the year, fixed-income trading revenue fell 3.7 percent to $4.93 billion, which Pruzan called a ""solid outcome"" given what he estimated was a roughly 15 percent decline in the overall fee pool.""We're not rethinking our strategy"" in fixed income, Pruzan said. ""For our rates and FX businesses, given where volatility was, given the fact there were less idiosyncratic events this year, it was a really bad backdrop.""Still, there were ""encouraging signs"" for some trading businesses in the first days of the year as interest rates climbed, he said.Shares of the company rose to $56.15 at 8:34 a.m. in early New York trading, from $55.35 at the close Wednesday.Fourth-quarter wealth-management revenue climbed 10 percent to $4.41 billion, exceeding the $4.22 billion estimate of Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Plc. Pretax profit in the unit set a record for the fourth straight quarter.Morgan Stanley took a $990 million charge in the quarter related to the U.S. tax overhaul. That was less than the $1.25 billion hit the company had warned was coming. It said its effective tax rate for this year will be 22 percent to 25 percent excluding one-time items, compared with 31 percent in 2017.Here's a summary of Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter results:Net income fell 59 percent to $686 million, or 29 cents a share, from $1.67 billion, or 81 cents, a year earlier, the company said Thursday in a statement. Excluding the tax charge, profit was 84 cents a share, beating the 77-cent estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The full-year return on equity, a gauge of profitability, rose to 9.4 percent from 7.9 percent in 2016. Morgan Stanley said its new ""medium-term"" target for ROE was 10 percent to 13 percent. Gorman had targeted 9 percent to 11 percent for 2017. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 5.3 percent to $9.5 billion, compared with the $9.24 billion average estimate.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Goldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Fixed-Income Trading Lags Peers

18,MS,"Citigroup (C) reported strong results for the fourth quarter Tuesday and said a $22 billion charge won't change how much money it plans to pay out to shareholders.

Global consumer banking revenue grew 6% to $8.4 billion. International clients group revenue dipped 1% to $8.1 billion, as fixed income trading revenue sank 18% to $2.4 billion while banking revenue climbed 14% to $4.7 billion.While Citigroup booked a $22 billion charge to account for the tax changes, the effect on capital that regulators scrutinize was ""much less significant,"" said CEO Michael Corbat in a statement, noting the annual bank ""stress tests,"" or Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), that's used to determine how much in buybacks and dividends banks can pay out.""Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval,"" he said.

20,MS,"Donald Trump sought to connect his presidency to the nation's prosperity in his first State of the Union address, arguing that the U.S. has arrived at a ""new American moment"" of wealth and opportunity.X The president dispensed with his trademark antagonism in a bid for bipartisanship, portraying his administration -- marked in his first year by discord -- as working to build a ""safe, strong and proud America."" In contrast with polling that shows most Americans consider him divisive, he promised to unify the country ""as one team, one people and one American family.""""I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, color, and creed,"" Trump said Tuesday. He began speaking shortly after 9 p.m. New York time.The White House billed the prime-time address as part economic victory lap and part bipartisan rallying cry. Central to the president's vision of a more unified country is an electorate widely benefiting from an economic boom for which Trump claims full credit. Tax cut legislation he signed late last year has already yielded bigger paychecks for millions of Americans, Trump said.""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses – many of them thousands of dollars per worker,"" Trump said. ""This in fact is our New American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.""While some employers have publicly credited the tax cuts for recent bonuses they've issued to workers, some of the money may have been paid out regardless thanks to the nation's tight labor market and strong economy. The director of the White House National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, said on Fox News before Trump's speech that the 3 million figure includes ""some type of tax bonus or wage increase or pension increase"" awarded to workers.Cohn said more than 350 companies have made ""announcements in direct reflection of what we've done with taxes.""Trump's speech is to feature bipartisan pitches on subjects including infrastructure and immigration. Guests seated in the First Lady's box at the speech include victims of gang violence and law enforcement officers wounded in the line of duty. The decision to highlight areas for possible cooperation across the aisle and to frame the president's remarks around stories of exceptional Americans is a tacit admission that Trump is addressing a Congress and a country sharply divided by the opening year of his administration.Early in the speech, a few moments drew bipartisan applause -- including Trump's recognition of Representative Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican gravely injured in a shooting last year at practice for the congressional baseball game, and a 12-year-old boy who started a movement to place flags at veterans' graves.But partisanship bled through. He asked Congress to give Cabinet secretaries the authority to fire federal workers ""who undermine the public trust or fail the American people,"" a proposal that would undermine U.S. civil service protections and would surely be fought by federal employee unions and Democrats.He endorsed controversial legislation that would allow people with terminal diseases to access experimental treatments, called ""right to try,"" a proposal that appeals to some patient advocates but that could potentially harm patients and disrupt medical research.Trump planned to steer clear of controversial issues surrounding the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, said a person familiar with the text. He instead devoted his remarks to the idea that an improving economy has helped all Americans. Central to that argument is a celebration of the tax cuts, passed by Republicans toward the end of last year, and a promise to crackdown on what Trump considers to be unfair trade arrangements.""America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs and our nation's wealth,"" he said.In striking a softer tone, the White House hopes to win back voters who appear to be abandoning the president and his party ahead of upcoming midterm elections, according to polls. Trump also seeks to encourage lawmakers in the throes of an immigration policy debate and still smarting from a dispute that led to a brief government shutdown to consider Trump's policy priorities.Infrastructure Plan
"
21,MS,"One of the centerpieces of the president's remarks was his pitch for an infrastructure development plan. Trump called on Congress to pass a plan to build at least $1.5 trillion worth of roads, transit and other projects, with federal dollars leveraging state, local and private money.""I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve,"" he said.As part of that effort Trump wants to streamline the gauntlet of federal regulations major projects face before construction begins. But critics warn the president's plan doesn't include enough direct spending, and say that his efforts to cut red tape could gut important environmental protections.""America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year – isn't it a disgrace that it can now take ten years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?"" he said.The White House similarly believes Trump's pitch for an immigration overhaul should win Democratic support -- and that more neutral language by Trump can shift a racially-charged debate. The administration has offered to give 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children a path to citizenship. But the trade-offs proposed by the administration include cuts to family-based immigration, what Trump calls ""chain migration,"" and a $25 billion trust fund for enhanced security including a wall on the Mexican border.""Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families,"" Trump said.Even as the White House framed the president's efforts as an attempt at reconciliation, guests of First Lady Melania Trump indicate the administration is digging in for a fight. Attendees include a law enforcement agent who has targeted the MS-13 gang, as well as parents of victims of the group. Many Democrats, meanwhile, invited immigrants who entered the country illegally as children and are facing uncertain futures after the president canceled his predecessor's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.Trump's wife traveled to the Capital ahead of her husband, in a break with tradition.Foreign policy presents similar challenges. While White House advisers say Trump seeks unity on issues of war and peace, invoking the heroism and sacrifice of service members fighting on behalf of the United States, he'll face lawmakers skeptical of his belligerent rhetoric toward North Korea and concerned by his bid to scuttle the Iran nuclear deal.Trump will celebrate the U.S. fight against Islamic State, which has cost the militant group 98 percent of its territory in Syria and Iraq, according to Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the international coalition combating the group.""Last year I pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth,"" Trump will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. ""One year later, I'm proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.""Aides say the speech was drafted over several weeks, with the president offering handwritten edits and sending aides ideas for passages and catchphrases. Aides involved in the writing of the address included senior adviser Stephen Miller, staff secretary Rob Porter and speechwriters Vince Haley and Ross Worthington.

24,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will take a roughly $1.25 billion hit to earnings in the fourth quarter, becoming the latest bank to detail how profit will be hurt in the near term by the U.S. tax overhaul driven by President Donald Trump.X The drag on net income consists of a charge of about $1.4 billion, primarily from writing down its U.S. deferred tax assets, the company said in a filing Friday. That's being offset by a gain of about $160 million related to a multiyear tax examination. The estimated tax provision is based on assumptions made by the firm and may change as it receives additional clarification, it said.Trump last month signed into law Congressional Republicans' tax overhaul, his first major legislative victory. The move slashes the corporate-tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, a cut that could benefit some banks. The plan also offers some temporary breaks for other types of businesses and individuals.While banks will benefit from the lower rate, the new law requires charges in the near-term as foreign earnings face taxation and the value of deferred tax assets declines. Goldman Sachs (GS) revealed last week that its earnings would be crimped by about $5 billion, mostly from the repatriation tax, while Bank of America (BAC) announced a $3 billion charge.Citigroup (C) has said it expects a hit of as much as $20 billion, mostly from writing down its DTAs. That was under an earlier version of the plan. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Capital One Financial (COF) have warned that tax changes could hit their earnings.

30,MS,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) bounced higher on Monday after the Senate this weekend passed its version of a plan to cut taxes, putting within reach a major GOP legislative victory and some long-awaited rewards for bank shareholders.X The Senate bill still needs to be reconciled with a bill from the House, a process set to begin this week. But the Senate bill contains particular rewards for banks.In particular, banks retained the ability to avoid taxes by steering payments to offshore subsidiaries, the New York Times noted. An earlier version of the Senate legislation sought to close off that benefit. And the bill allows banks to leave out payments pertaining to derivatives when tallying their taxes.Goldman shares rose 0.7% to close at 250.65 on the stock market today, adding to last week's 5.5% jump. The stock was still in range of a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. JPMorgan surged 2.1%, after last week's 6.6% pop. Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 1.4%. Bank of America (BAC) surged 3.4%; Citigroup (C) gained 2.1% and Wells Fargo (WFC) added 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.More broadly, the banks also would benefit if the tax cuts manage to accelerate the economy and spur loan growth. Stronger economic growth and inflation would likely prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — a move that lifts borrowing costs to keep overexpansion in check but boosts banks' profits by allowing them to foist the higher costs onto the customers that receive credit from them.The Fed seems likely to decide to raise rates at its next policy meeting on Dec. 12-13.Higher expectations for a better economy and, in turn, rising prices, would also raise yields on the longer-term government bonds that influence the value of some loans. Those yields rise when investors seek a greater return on their bonds to offset the weaker buying power of the dollar over time.The short end of the yield curve — a measure of the difference between short-term and long-term government debt —  has risen as the Fed raises rates. But the spread between the short end and the long end of the curve has been particularly narrow, a sign of a potentially weaker economy.Meanwhile, banks this year have also dealt with muted loan growth and trading results.""Lower tax rates will increase banks' profitability, but higher profits may benefit shareholders more than creditors if dividends or share buybacks also increase,"" Celina Vansetti-Hutchins, managing director at Moody's, said in a statement on Saturday.""In addition,"" Vansetti-Hutchins said, ""lower tax rates will result in one-time write-downs of deferred tax assets, and home values may face downward pressure, with a potential negative effect on banks' mortgage loan books and a modest second order negative impact on other consumer loans.""RELATED:Top Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These 3 SectorsBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisGOP Has Votes For Tax Bill, McConnell Says; S&P 500 Pares Flynn Losses

31,MS,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak. REITs, utilities and other ""defensive stocks"" were not immune to the sell-offs.(A version of this column was first published on Dec. 12, 2016.)RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingHow To Find Dividend Stocks With Staying PowerWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

The next policy meeting takes place on Dec. 12-13.When the Fed raises the rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other to meet financial quotas, banks pass the higher costs on to consumers, often through raising rates on their own loans. The higher rates help improve banks' financial results.Meanwhile, Powell hinted that he favors relief on financial rules. While not a surprise, the combination of steady of monetary policy and regulatory relief is positive for banks.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose Wednesday. That rate also influences the rates on credit that banks offer to their customers.Wall Street has been concerned about the flattening of the yield curve, a gauge of inflation expectations that tracks the difference between short-term and long-term government debt. Earlier this month, the gap between the short end and long end of that curve was at its narrowest in a decade, raising concerns about a weaker economy. The yield spread widened slightly on Wednesday.The short end of that curve has crept up as the Fed raises rates. When Wall Street expects the economy to be stronger in the years ahead, the long end of the curve rises, as future economic growth raises prices and investors demand a greater return on their bonds to make up for the declining buying power of the dollar.Rising yields were definitely a factor Wednesday. Dow financials JPMorgan, Goldman and American Express (AXP) rallied, but Visa (V) fell sharply.

Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) is closing in on a 76.24 buy point but cleared an alternative entry at 74.95 in strong volume this morning.Two additional bank-stock breakouts included Northern Trust (NTRS), up 2.5%; and SunTrust Banks (STI), up 4%.A convergence of factors appear to be favoring some sectors at the expense of others. Tech is suffering but other areas are rising. In Tuesday's new highs list, the building sector delivered 29 new highs; banks, 27; and finance, 22. Chips only accounted for two new highs.Factors influencing the strong side of the stock market include: Trump's choice to head the Fed, who is finding favor; the Republican tax-cut package which won tentative but positive remarks from maverick Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine; and recent economic data, including a 17-year high for consumer confidence.Before the open Wednesday, the bulls received additional good news. The second reading on Q3 GDP rolled in at 3.3%, up from the initial reading of 3%. While this only matched the consensus estimate, the growth was encouraging and signaled no trouble in the economy.Besides the gains in bank stocks, the retail sector also surged in midday action. Retail industry groups accounted for a slew of the day's top performers. Some of the retail stocks are comeback stories. Urban Outfitters (URBN), a former leading stock that has been struggling for more than two years, is on track for its 11th daily gain in a row. Urban is climbing the right side of a deep cup base.On the loss side, the three chip groups were among the worst performers for the day.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech As Apple, FANG Stocks Down; Telcos RallyFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipBitcoin Jumps Over $11,000Why The 10-Week Line Can Be An Investor's Best FriendStock Market Today: Could These 4 Retailers Jam In 2018?

42,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) will pay Alkermes (ALKS) $28 million upfront and up to $200 million in milestones to gain another multiple sclerosis treatment in its arsenal as key drug Tecfidera faces a patent cliff in the mid-2020s.X The collaboration and license agreement is for Alkermes' drug known as ALKS 8700, a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. ALKS 8700 is currently in Phase 3 testing. Evidence suggests it could have fewer gastrointestinal side effects vs. Tecfidera.Under the terms of the deal, Biogen will receive a worldwide license to commercialize ALKS 8700 and pay Alkermes a royalty on worldwide net sales, Biogen said in a news release.Biogen will take over development costs on Jan. 1. The company expects to record its first $50 million milestone payment as an expense this year. The $28 million upfront payment represents half of the development costs for ALKS 8700 thus far in 2017.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat called the deal a ""win for both sides."" For Biogen, it solves worries of the Tecfidera patent cliff in the mid-2020s. Alkermes' ALKS 8700 is patent-protected through 2032, he said. For Alkermes, it means a speedier approval process for ALKS 8700.IBD'S TAKE: Larger biotechs struggled in the third quarter as smaller companies topped expectations. Visit the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on how the third quarter impacted the stocks.Investors had been concerned about Alkermes' ability to commercialize ALKS 8700, as well as challenge Biogen's massive multiple sclerosis drug franchise, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients.""To this point from our perspective, Biogen seems to be the perfect partner for Alkermes and could use ALKS 8700 as a life-cycle extender should the company's dosing (intellectual property) for Tecfidera come under fire,"" he said.Earlier this year, Alkermes presented one-month and three-month safety data for its drug at a conference in Paris. The data, from an open-label study, suggests ALKS 8700 could have an improved gastrointestinal profile relative to Tecfidera.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients that he hadn't considered ALKS 8700 to be much of a competitive threat to Biogen's Tecfidera. Rather, the move is a ""defensive play"" to better position Biogen's multiple sclerosis drug franchise at a relatively modest cost.""Nonetheless, in Biogen's hands, we believe it could have better potential to help the company retain some share in an increasingly competitive MS market, particularly if they could garner use in patients otherwise discontinuing Tecfidera due to GI toxicity,"" he said.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen was up 0.9% to finish at 311.73. Alkermes initially lifted as much as 3.7% just after the opening bell, but sank 1.4% to close at 50.36.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Ionis Shares Dip After Third-Quarter Sales, Earnings MissBiogen Dives Despite Topping Views; Lilly, Novartis Beat

43,MS,"Regulation: After Consumer Finance Protection Bureau chief Richard Cordray submitted his resignation, President Trump picked a suitable temporary director to replace him: Mick Mulvaney, the current director of the Office of Management and Budget. The swamp didn't like it.It turns out that Cordray, quite illegally, on his way out named his deputy, Leandra English, as the temporary director. When Mulvaney arrived at work Monday morning, he was forced to issue a memo saying ""Please disregard any instructions you receive from Ms. English in her presumed capacity as acting director.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveHe was being polite. This was nothing more than an attempt at a bureaucratic coup d'etat, or ""resistance"" in the popular phrase of the far left.The fact is, Trump has every right by law to name a temporary acting director of a federal agency. And if you don't believe it, here's what Mary McLeod, the CFPB's very own general counsel, had to say about that: ""Questions have been raised whether the president has the authority under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) to designate Mick Mulvaney ... as Acting Director of CFPB. ... This confirms my oral advice to the Senior Leadership Team that the answer is 'yes.' ""What has really turned this whole thing on its head is that English now has the gall to sue Trump for naming Mulvaney to the post. English claimed she, not Mulvaney, was the ""rightful"" occupant of the temporary director's slot. Why? Well, because, that's why!XIf nothing else, this shows what a monumental, perhaps even Sisyphean, job it will be for Trump to drain Washington's fetid bureaucratic swamp. It's not the dirty water so much as the swamp monsters that make it such a perilous task.Those who work in the CFPB, which was created by the Obama administration in 2010 as the right arm of the financially disastrous regulatory monstrosity known as Dodd-Frank, think of themselves as having a special mission: to regulate every nuance of the U.S. consumer financial world, supposedly to ""protect"" consumers.It's important to know, as well, that the CFPB is the fevered brainchild of  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She — along with her New England senatorial tag-team partner and socialist stalwart, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — inhabits the farthest fringe of the Democratic Party. As with all so-called progressives, she believes that the American people are ignorant sheep that need to be herded by wise shepherd-kings (that is, bureaucrats like Leandra English) for their own good.This is why Warren, English and other members of the inside-the-Beltway progressive ""resistance"" are even willing to break the law: For them, the ends always justify the means, the law be damned.As we've said before, the CFPB is basically a rogue agency, with virtually no accountability to Congress or to the American people for that matter.  It was designed that way. And no, this is not just a question of governance style; it's a question of constitutionality, of the rule of law.In its current form, the CFPB is unconstitutional, as a federal court way back in October of 2016 already ruled. Yet it remains little changed, the kind of nightmarish bureaucracy that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party would impose on us across the board if given the chance. It would be a serious erosion of what remains of our precious constitutional rights.The mainstream media have largely treated this as a kind of he-said/she-said spat. It's not. It's quite serious. If Leandra English can declare herself head of a major U.S. agency, then the chances of truly reasserting control over the administrative state would shrink to near zero.So what to do? Well, almost certainly Trump will be upheld in his right to name a temporary replacement for Cordray. So what if the remaining CFPB minions refuse to acknowledge the reality? As some have suggested, it's time to seriously clean house.""The president should fire her immediately, and anyone who disobeys Director Mulvaney's order should also be fired summarily,"" said Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. ""The Constitution and the law must prevail against the supposed resistance.""Here, here. It's time to roll back the power of the bureaucrats, and reclaim power for elected officials who actually answer to the voters. If that doesn't work, we'll repeat what we've suggested before: Shut the useless, money-wasting, economy-distorting CFPB down. It won't be missed.RELATED:How Can We Fix The CFPB?

45,MS,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages retreated Thursday as news about the Senate tax legislation and revised House version raised concerns. Several top-rated stocks tested recent buy points, including Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL)-supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Monster Beverage (MNST) and Splunk (SPLK), but closed above their entry areas.XFutures for the S&P 500 index fell 0.2% Friday morning even as Nvidia (NVDA) and Walt Disney (DIS) rose overnight following their quarterly reports. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures were down about 0.3%.Netflix fell 1.3% to 193.90 in Thursday's stock market trading. Intraday, the internet TV giant dipped to 190.81, less than 0.5% above a 190.05 buy point. The stock also approached its 50-day moving average.Netflix broke out in early October on plans to hike subscription fees, then rose further on strong subscriber growth and guidance. But the stock has been moving sideways in recent weeks. Its hit show ""House of Cards"" has suspended production and dropped star Kevin Spacey amid widespread allegations of sexual misconduct by the actor. Meanwhile, Apple apparently outbid Netflix for a new drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.Late Thursday, Netflix shares fell fractionally. Disney's streaming TV service will be priced below Netflix, the media giant said on its post-earnings call.The Apple iPhone chipmaker fell as low as 109.53, undercutting a 110.71 buy point intraday for a second straight session. But Skyworks closed at 111.12, down 1.8%.Skyworks broke out in late October, and has generally held in the buy zone amid its strong earnings and bullish results from Apple, as well as Broadcom (AVGO) making a $130 billion bid for Qualcomm (QCOM).Morgan Stanley retreated 22 cents to 48.82, but intraday sank to 48.26, below its 50-day moving average and 48.59 entry. Morgan Stanley is down 2.4% this week as bank stocks are among the biggest losers.Monster Beverage had a wild session, falling as low as 56 and rising to 59.88 before settling for 1.2% gain at 58.68. At the low, Monster Beverage fell well below its 57.35 entry point and just undercut its 50-day line. The energy drink maker reported weaker-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, though revenue topped views.The maker of data analytics software fell 0.5% to 70.78 after sinking to 69.36 intraday. That tested a 69.71 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Splunk will report quarterly earnings next week.Keep in mind that a stock may successfully find support above a buy point or other key support levels multiple times, but that's no guarantee that it will continue to do so.RELATED:The Big Picture: Should Bipolar Market Worry Bulls?Four Reasons Why JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Other Bank Stocks Keep FallingStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

46,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other banks continued their slide on Thursday, as Wall Street frets over the prospects of the GOP's economic agenda and signals of a weakening economy.XJPMorgan Chase pared losses to down 1 cent at 26.49 in the stock market today, but is off 3.7% so far this week. Bank of America retreated 1.1% and nearly 5% so far in the week. Citigroup (C) rallied to close up 0.1%, but is off 2% this week. Morgan Stanley (MS) dipped 0.45% Thursday and Goldman Sachs (GS) shed 0.2%, both adding to their recent losses.JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are back in buy range, approaching their 50-day lines. Citigroup is back in a buy zone, actively testing the 50-day line. Morgan Stanley closed above its buy point and its 50-day after undercutting them intraday. Goldman Sachs, which flirted with a buy zone at the start of November, has pulled back.Meanwhile, superregional bank US Bancorp (USB) has tumbled nearly 5% since Monday's close, undercutting a buy point, its 50-day line and its 200-day line in turn.Bank groups dominated the worst-performing industries this week.The Senate's version of a tax-cut bill would delay a corporate tax cut to 2019, according to widespread reports ahead of the legislation's expected release Thursday. That news sent the S&P 500 index and other major averages sharply lower, though they closed well off session lows.Democrats' big Tuesday election wins in Virginia and New Jersey raise the prospect that the House of Representatives could be in play in next year's midterm elections. More Democrats mean more objections to Republicans' plans to implement the kind of deregulation bank investors have been waiting for since President Trump took office.""If we are right and Virginia signals increased chances that control of the House flips, then investors need to start thinking about Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) as the next chairman of the House Financial Services Committee,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said, according to MarketWatch. ""While we doubt that Waters could implement an anti-bank, anti-financials agenda,"" he continued, ""the financial sector would no longer have a wind at its back from Congress and we think the headline risk for the industry would increase significantly.""IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,550 on Wednesday, up 1,650 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Meanwhile, the yield curve, which gauges the difference between return rates, or yields, on short-term and long-term government debt reached its flattest point in a decade this week.A widening spread between long- and short-term maturities reflect optimism about the economic, as investors demand a higher yield to offset the inflation that comes from a stronger economy, while borrowers bet they can generate solid returns with the funds. A flattening curve, in turn, can reflect more pessimism.The 10-year Treasury yield, which shot up in late 2016 (especially after Trump's election raised expectations of tax cuts and other reforms), has been flat in 2017, actually down a few basis points from the end of last year. The short end has risen, as the Federal Reserve slowly raises rates, with another hike expected in December.The yields on different Treasuries affect the value of an assortment of credit products that banks issue to customers. It also puts pressure on banks' traditional model of borrowing short and lending long.That may be why regional banks have fallen harder this week than global financial titans with heavy Wall Street businesses, such as JPMorgan and Citigroup.Bank stocks have had periods when they have outperformed the broader market. But in 2017 and for the past several years, JPMorgan and other banks' relative strength lines have largely moved in sync with the S&P 500 index. One, bank stocks are a big share of the S&P 500, so their moves are going to have a noticeable impact on the benchmark index. Second, banks' profits improve with the economy, so it's hard to have a radically different performance than Corporate America overall.RELATED:Here's How Rivals Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Are DivergingJPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformBanks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

47,MS,"Bears swatted two segments of the stock market midday Wednesday, knocking down small caps and bank stocks for a second straight session.XThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 were little changed midday as the two major indexes slipped 0.1% each. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was down on both major exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday.After falling 1.3% Tuesday, the small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.5% in midday trade Wednesday. Meanwhile, the PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) exchange traded fund dropped 1% after skidding 2.3% in the previous session.Reuters noted that the yield curve is near its flattest level in a decade. A normal yield curve offers higher yields on long-term bonds than on short-term bonds.  A flat yield curve is a situation where yields are close together; this can be a precursor to economic trouble. An inverted yield curve involves yields that are higher short term than long term — a signal of recession, according to some market watchers.On Wednesday, the big money-center bank group was on track for its fourth loss in as many days. So far this week, Bank of America (BAC) is down 4.5%; JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is off almost 4%; Wells Fargo (WFC) is off 3.5%; Citigroup (C), 2%; Morgan Stanley (MS), 2%; and Goldman Sachs (GS), 1.5%.Small caps had some wild performers. Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) screamed 16% lower after missing earnings estimates by 48%. Drone maker AeroVironment (AVAV) dropped 9% in heavy volume, apparently on valuation concerns.On the bullish side, the day's top gainers included food groups and diversified operations, which are defensive plays. This theme, however, was not consistent. Other conservative plays, such as utilities and tobacco, were losing ground.Another factor that the stock market had to digest was the Republican defeat in several elections. Democrats won the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also won the mayoral race in Manchester (New Hampshire's largest city) and had a strong showing in several states up and down the ballot.For the stock market, the results could affect Republican efforts to get a tax-cut package approved.RELATED:Crude Oil Stockpiles Unexpectedly RiseSalesforce.com's Forecast Is Bullish Through 2022

49,MS,"Never count out Mylan (MYL), an analyst said Wednesday, after the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic versions of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug — setting shares of the two companies on vastly divergent paths.XBy the close of trading on the stock market today, Mylan had spiked 16.2% to 37.80. Teva, meanwhile, plunged 14.6% to 16.08. Analysts largely hadn't expected the FDA to approve generic Copaxone until 2018.The approvals were for a 20-milligram daily dose and for 40-milligram shots three times per week. The 40-milligram approval is the first generic at that dose. Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) got approval for a 20-milligram daily Copaxone generic, Glatopa, in 2015.Mylan also announced a patient support service dubbed Mylan MS Advocate to help ease patients off branded Copaxone and to its generics with an interactive mobile app, in-home injection training, a 24/7 call center, copay assistance for eligible patients and support from a nurse experienced at treating MS.Analysts were widely surprised at the approvals, which came on the heels of fresh comments from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Bloomberg regarding the need to speed generic drug approvals to spur competition and reduce drug prices.""Bottom line, this is incrementally positive for Mylan while for Teva both a negative surprise and a cash flow hit to 2018,"" RBC analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his underperform rating on Teva stock.Teva called the impending launch by Mylan ""at-risk,"" meaning the rival generic drugmaker could be subject to damages and other remedies pending the outcomes of appeals decisions and other patent litigation.In one case, Teva is arguing against a December 2016 decision by the Patent Trial Appeal Board that found all claims from three Copaxone patents were invalid. Teva also is arguing against a January decision in district court that invalidated the claims of four patents covering Copaxone.The firm also is suing five companies, including Mylan, claiming they infringed on a patent covering the manufacturing process for Copaxone. All five companies are working to bring generic copies of the MS drug to the market.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 7 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 7% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. See better-rated drug stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Teva expects Mylan's generic launch to eat 25 cents earnings per share in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. RBC's Stanicky noted Teva had previously predicted one or two generics could lead to $1 billion to $1.3 billion in annual revenue downside and a $1 hit to per-share earnings.""Teva previously guided to slow Copaxone deterioration due to the stickiness of its patient support program which could play out initially,"" he wrote. However, Mylan's patient support program ""should drive more switching over time.""Consensus numbers project 9% erosion to Teva's Copaxone in the fourth quarter and a decline of 39% in 2018, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. He expects Teva to ""have to dig deeper for additional cost cuts to offset some of this.""BTIG analyst Timothy Chiang models Mylan bringing in $425 million to $450 million in generic Copaxone sales in the first 12 months following its launch, assuming generic pricing is a 35%-40% discount to the branded drug and Mylan can grab 25%-30% of market share.""We believe the company gaining approval on both strengths of Copaxone not only validates Mylan's core competency as a premier generics company, it also provides an important signal to investors that one can simply never count out Mylan — especially in the area of complex generic products,"" he said.Chiang kept his buy rating on Mylan stock and boosted his price target to 45 from 42.Mylan, in a news release, said it and other first filers could be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity, but noted that the FDA hadn't yet made a formal determination on that. In the 12 months ended July 31, both strengths of Copaxone brought in $4.34 billion in sales, the firm said.The approvals could be a negative for other entrants, like Momenta and Novartis' Sandoz which are working on getting approval for a 40-milligram version of Copaxone. In February, the duo got a warning letter from the FDA which detailed issues at manufacturer Pfizer's (PFE) fill-finish plant.Momenta stock plunged 13.7% to 15.10 in response to Mylan's approvals.Payers are likely to also put pressure on Biogen (BIIB) to lower the prices of its MS drugs, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research report. In 2016, the six-drug suite brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales.""We believe this highlights the need for Biogen to concede price or share as multiple new generics and branded therapies enter the market in the coming years (especially in a space that does not have high intrinsic growth),"" he wrote.Abrahams estimates Biogen reporting $9 billion in MS drug sales in 2017, but declining 17% by 2025 to $7.6 billion. He noted ""these declines could be higher if payers get more aggressive."" Biogen stock dipped 0.8% to 314.92 in response.RELATED:Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tBiotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisHow Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

Even if a private sale happens, shares could still be listed in Saudi Arabia's Tadawul exchange next year, and a possible international IPO could follow in 2019 at the earliest, according to the FT.The persistently low price of crude and Saudi Arabia's inability to raise it have weighed on Aramco's prospective IPO, the proceeds of which would rely in part on how high its oil reserves and future sales would be valued.On Friday, U.S. crude settled at $51.45 a barrel, up 1.7%, and Brent climbed 1.5% to $57.10.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.In 2016, Riyadh announced plans to sell up to 5% of Aramco to help raise capital as the country looks to diversify its economy and rely less on oil. Saudi officials have said a public offering would happen next year, and Aramco said Friday that its IPO plans are still on track.Exchanges in New York and London were among the bourses around the world that have been jockeying to woo Aramco.But the Saudi royal family is reportedly worried about legal issues if the company is listed in New York — after a new law lets families of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks sue Saudi Arabia. Concerns about increasing regulatory scrutiny reportedly derailed any plan of a U.K. listing.Aramco has been valued at more than $2 trillion, far greater than current leader Apple's (AAPL) more than $700 billion market cap. Analysts originally expected an IPO to generate $100 billion in proceeds, topping Alibaba's (BABA) record $25 billion in 2014.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were expected to be among the global coordinators and book-runners for the IPO, the FT reported earlier, and the banks would have collected massive fees with the offering.But some reports have since valued the company at $1 trillion, and low oil prices have put pressure on the company to scale back operations as Saudi Arabia leads OPEC and non-OPEC members to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market to help support oil prices.RELATED: U.S. Oil Inventories, Production Drop; IEA Sees More OPEC Cuts

54,MS,"Bank of America (BAC) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings Friday, amid strong loan demand, while Wells Fargo (WFC) fell short on revenue as lending slowed.The results come a day after earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C), whose shares, some analysts said, were weighed down by worries over credit as the current credit cycle advances into the later stages.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) will close out the big banks' earnings season next week.Bank of America's earnings per share rose 17% to $0.48, beating Zacks estimates for 46 cents. Revenue was up 1% to $22.08 billion, just beating forecasts for $21.981 billion.As with other banks, BofA's trading overall remained weak compared to a year ago, when geopolitical shocks churned markets. Banks face particularly tough comparisons to 2016, when surprises like Brexit and President Trump's election spurred brisk trading activity.Revenue for fixed income, currencies and commodities fell 22%, but rose 2% for equities.Consumer banking revenue rose 10% to $8.8 billion, global banking revenue climbed 5% to $5 billion, and global wealth and investment management revenue gained 6% to $4.6 billion. Loans grew by 8%, 4% and 8%, respectively, across those three businesses. Net charge-offs rose 1%.Overall, BofA's loan-loss reserves fell by 2%. In its consumer banking division, the bank set aside an extra $269 million for credit losses, citing ""credit card seasoning and loan growth."" The bank said credit quality remained strong.JPMorgan and Citigroup on Thursday also said they padded their reserves during the third quarter to cover credit-card losses.Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said Bank of America's shares ""underperformed yesterday ... as the market saw elevated credit costs for Citi and JPM as an omen for BAC earnings.""""However, on balance, BAC's results stack up better than those of peers,"" Chubak said, citing better-than-expected credit, net interest income, loan growth and expense management.Bank of America shares rose 1.5% to 25.83 in the stock market today, back above a 25.45 entry after sinking to 25.12 in the morning. BofA fell to 25.45 on Thursday.Wells Fargo, meanwhile, reported EPS up 1% to $1.04, which excludes a litigation accrual of 20 cents a share related to a pre-financial-crisis mortgage-related investigation. The figure was in line with expectations. But revenue fell 2% to $21.9 billion, missing estimates for $22.32 billion.Net interest income grew 4% to $12.5 billion. Net interest margin, a measure of the difference between the interest taken in from loans and paid to depositors, was 2.87%.""We are waiting for the quarter that Wells shows stronger momentum across the business and this was not the quarter,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a research note on Friday, adding that loan growth and the bank's net interest margin were lower than they expected.Total loan balance was $951.9 billion, down $5.5 billion from Q2 and $9.45 billion from a year ago. Q3 marked the third straight sequential decline in loan balance. The net loan charge-off rate rose to 0.3% from 0.27% in Q2. Total deposits climbed by $5.2 billion during Q3 to $1.3 trillion.Shares fell 2.75% to 53.69. The stock also retreated Thursday, moving further from a double-bottom base buy point of 56.70.Wells Fargo continues to deal with scrutiny over its sales practices amid allegations of fabricating accounts, altering home loans and giving customers auto insurance they didn't want. Analysts, as they have for the past year, will be looking for signals that the bank can make things right with consumers and investors.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Across most of the big money center banks, trading has been a sore spot for the second and third quarters as well, and could be for the rest of the year.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday, forecast weak fourth-quarter trading results, saying there was nothing obvious on the horizon that would give them a boost.Still, JPMorgan's third-quarter EPS topped estimates. Lending was solid. Higher interest rates, a result of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, also helped. Citigroup's (C) results were also better than analysts expected.But analysts raised concerns about the increases in provisions that the banks set aside to cover bad loans.Citigroup in Q3 set aside an extra $500 million related to its North American card business, based on its expectations for bad loans and the effects of recent hurricanes. JPMorgan said net card charge-offs were higher during the third quarter and that it had added $300 million in credit-card reserves, largely due to the ""seasoning of newer vintages.""Analysts have said that investments in Citigroup's Costco (COST) card, and other cards, could start adding to earnings in the second half of this year. But Citigroup's branded-card revenues in North America fell 1% in the third quarter, adding to investors' disappointment.CFO John Gerspach said that the Costco card ""remains a real winner"" and that they were seeing growth in account balances and purchases.Moody's warned in June that over the last several quarters, credit-card charge-offs, or debt a lender believes it has next to no chance of getting back, had ""increased materially for some US lenders,"" amounting to the biggest spike since 2009.JPMorgan, the firm said then, had put up a ""more stable performance,"" while Bank of America was strong and Citigroup appeared to ""be weakening only slightly.""""We continue to believe that credit will continue to normalize at a relatively slow pace, and we are not overly concerned with the pickup in delinquency rates this quarter,"" Kleinhanzl wrote in a research note on Thursday.JPMorgan dipped 0.1% to 95.88 but rebounded from an intraday low of 94.96, briefly dropping below a 95.32 buy point. Citigroup slipped 0.4%, but off session lows.RELATED:JPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformBitcoin Hits Record; JPMorgan 'Open Minded' To Regulated Digital CashBank Of America, JPMorgan Lead 5 Banks Hitting Buys As GOP Tax Plan Boosts YieldsBuffett Says He'll Hold This Bank Stock For A 'Long, Long, Long' TimeCould Goldman Sachs Be The First Bank To Offer Bitcoin Trades?

"
56,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said Thursday that trading will likely be weak again in the fourth quarter, with no overt catalysts on the horizon, even as the effects of natural and man-made cataclysms loom.While the bank topped Q3 earnings forecasts, trading revenue dropped 16% to $5.5 billion, with fixed income revenue down 27% and equity market revenue down 4%.Brexit and Donald Trump's surprise election victory sparked a surge in volatility and trading last year, but activity has since quieted, weighing on banks' trading desks.A flurry of big events recently also won't appear to have much impact. Catalonia's attempt to separate from Spain was unlikely to ""materially"" affect business sentiment and global growth elsewhere could cushion against any minor difficulties, said CEO Jamie Dimon on a conference call with reporters.Hurricanes in the U.S. and Caribbean and earthquakes in Mexico had affected ""many of our customers,"" the bank said in a statement, but management said during the call that their financial impact was ""not significant.""And as Wall Street waits for tax reform from Washington, D.C., CFO Marianne Lake indicated that JPMorgan wasn't emphasizing the subject in talks with some of its clients about loans.""At this point, it's not front and center in the dialog we're having with our clients about whether they should or shouldn't do a strategic deal or take an action,"" she said on a conference call with analysts. ""So I would say it's neither holding up business nor spurring business. But that could change.""Shares slipped 0.9% to 95.99 in the stock market today, still within range of a 95.32 buy point of a flat base. Citigroup (C), which also beat views, fell 3.4% to 72.37 after briefly hitting its best intraday level since January 2009. Shares have now fallen back into buy range from a 69.96 entry, but the huge-volume slide should give investors pause.Among peers that report Friday, Bank of America (BAC) fell 1.5% to right at its 24.45 buy point, and Wells Fargo (WFC) eased 0.8% to 55.21, edging away from a double-bottom base buy point of 56.70.Goldman Sachs (GS) dipped 1.1% to 239.80, and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 1.2% to 48.59. Both investment banking giants report next week.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.JPMorgan's Q3 earnings per share of rose 11% to $1.76, topping Zacks Investment Research estimates for $1.67. Managed revenue grew 3% to $26.2 billion, while reported revenue of $25.33 billion fell short of Zacks views for $25.68 billion. Average core loans rose 7%, slowing from the previous quarter. Investment banking revenue fell 2%.In contrast with weak trading results, the retail side was stronger. Lending revenue rose 17%, and consumer and business banking revenue grew 15%.The bank had a reserve build of $300 million for its credit-card business, although it said the credit environment remained ""benign"" and that demand for credit remained solid. The reserves are used to cushion against bad loans.""While higher reserve build in Card may give some investors pause, underlying revenue/expense trends were strong,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said in a research note.JPMorgan said that credit-card spending had moderated but remained strong and that engagement for its premium Chase Sapphire Reserve card was also good.But as banking becomes more smartphone-based — JPMorgan active mobile customers jumped 12% in the third quarter — Lake said later in the day that ""branches still matter,"" adding that 75% of the bank's growth in deposits came from customers using branches.Still, she said the bank was keeping pace with customers' changing preferences, and that net for the year, the bank would have 125 fewer branch locations.JPMorgan also said it hadn't seen any specific uptick in fraud following the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX).Meanwhile, Citigroup's EPS climbed 14% to $1.42, better than estimates for $1.32, as revenue rose 2% to $18.17 billion, beating forecasts for $17.85 billion.Fixed-income revenue fell 11% to $2.88 billion, while equity markets revenue rose 10% to $757 million. Consumer banking revenue grew 3% to $8.4 billion, and institutional clients revenue climbed 9% to $9.2 billion. Citi built up another roughly $500 million in reserves for its North American card business.RELATED: Big Bank Earnings This Week: What To WatchBank Of America, JPMorgan Lead 5 Banks Hitting Buys As GOP Tax Plan Boosts YieldsBuffett Says He'll Hold This Bank Stock For A 'Long, Long, Long' TimeCould Goldman Sachs Be The First Bank To Offer Bitcoin Trades?

61,MS,"Bank of America (BAC),  JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Suntrust Banks (STI) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) all topped buy points Wednesday, at least intraday, as the Trump-backed GOP tax plan boosted Treasury yields and the stock market generally. Several other big banks are close to entries, while Citigroup (C) continued to rise after breaking out earlier this month.XThe tax reform would slash the corporate rate to 20% from 35%, while reducing personal income tax rates. Banks would benefit from the lower tax rates directly, as well as from stronger economic growth and the resulting impact on Federal Reserve and market interest rates.The continued courting of buy points by bank stocks comes a week after they neared buy zones following the Fed's still-bullish for raising interest rates and its decision to slim down its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Market expectations of a Fed rate hike in December have risen significantly over the past two weeks, rising to 81% on Wednesday from 72% on Tuesday and just 38% a month ago.JPMorgan Chase rose rose 1.6% to 95.18 in the stock market today, closing just below a 95.32 flat-base buy point after moving to 95.72 intraday.Bank of America advanced 2.4% to 25.41, just below a 25.45 buy point with a shallow base.

Wells Fargo is still reeling from the fake-account scandal and is trying to move back to its 200-day moving average.The 10-year Treasury yield, which can influence the rates on various types of loans, was up to 2.30% on Wednesday. The 2-year Treasury yield was up to 1.47%.Longer-term rates tend to rise when investors expect higher inflation in the future and demand a bigger return to offset a weakening dollar over that time.

Symantec has the look of a flawed double-bottom base. The flaw is that its second low didn't undercut the first low. Aggressive investors could regard 31.73 as an alternative entry, but that involves more risk than if the double-bottom base was proper.Security software firms were getting a lift because of the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX).

67,MS,"Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS) popped to a 20-month high Tuesday after announcing the annual price for one of its drugs at nearly double analysts' expectations, but shares gave back nearly all those gains by the closing bell.XWhen the regular trading session ended on the stock market today, Adamas had gained 0.9% to 21.30. It earlier lifted as much as 12.8% to a high last seen in January 2016.On Monday, Adamas said it plans to charge $28,500 per patient per year for its drug, Gocovri. Gocovri was approved in August to treat involuntary movements known as dyskinesia in patients taking levodopa, a common treatment for Parkinson's disease.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler had called for $14,400 per patient annually for the drug. The firm also is looking at Gocovri as a potential treatment to improve walking gait in patients with multiple sclerosis.Koffler raised her peak sales estimate on Gocovri to $266 million, up from $92 million. She cut 2018 expectations after Adamas guided to just 1% market penetration next year for Gocovri. Reimbursement issues are likely to be sorted in 2019 with approval for MS in 2020.""We heard investor concerns about a slow launch in 2018 and unrealistic consensus estimates, and we agree that numbers may come down,"" she said in a note to clients. ""However, Adamas is not a one-trick pony, in our view, and we expect a stream of catalysts to maintain visibility.""IBD'S TAKE: Trial data could ""make or break"" biotechs this month. See who's on the line and which trials are expected to read out in September via IBD Industry Themes.Koffler expects takeout chatter to escalate as Gocovri's quarterly run rate increases. She kept her buy rating on Adamas, but boosted her price target to 48 from 26.The price for Gocovri is in line with other central nervous system disorder drugs, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a research report. He has a buy rating and 38 price target on Adamas stock.Belanger sees peak sales for Gocovri as a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the $500 million range. The ""current valuation of Adamas fails to capture Gocovri's potential in levodopa-induced dyskinesia and its late-stage pipeline opportunities,"" he said.In multiple sclerosis walking, Adamas will rival Acorda Therapeutics' (ACOR) Ampyra, which is expected to generate $535 million to $545 million in sales this year. Adamas also has a late-stage epilepsy drug in development, he said. Phase 3 testing could begin in 2018-19.RELATED:This Biotech Rose To A 19-Month High — What's Prodding Shares?Acorda Dives To 10-Week Low After FDA Refuses Parkinson's DrugAcorda Dives On Merger Talk As Investors Tries To Urge A Sale

68,MS,"Major stock indexes were mixed and not moving much in either direction Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield stabilized, giving a much-needed lift to financials.XThe blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.2%, while the Nasdaq retreated 0.3% and the S&P 500 was mostly flat. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was tracking lower than Thursday's levels.Insurer and Dow Jones industrial average component Travelers (TRV) jumped 4%  to 119.75 after a sharp drop off its recent high of 130.37.Also in the Dow, Morgan Stanley (MS) edged higher as it continued to test support at the 200-day moving average. Morgan Stanley has the highest EPS Rating in its group, a 95. An EPS Rating of 95 means the stock has grown earnings faster than 95% of the stocks in IBD's databaseThe Select Sector SPDR Financial (XLF) outperformed, rising 1%. The exchange traded fund is also battling for support at the 10-week moving average.Inside the IBD 50, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) was a nice gainer, up about 4%. The Leaderboard name is now extended from a 45.05 buy pointSymantec (SYMC) was a top gainer in the S&P 500. The big cap gapped up as much as 6% before trimming its gain to 4%. Cybersecurity names like Symantec were strong on news of a data breach at Equifax (EFX) reported late Thursday.In the security software group, other stocks rising included Qualys (QLYS), up 4%; Proofpoint (PFPT), up 2%; and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), up 1%. Qualys is extended at this point, but Proofpoint is trying to clear a base with a 94.43 buy point, while Palo Alto Networks is holding gains smartly after recently gapping up over a 144 entry.RELATED:Alibaba Expands Into Groceries To Corral The Digital ConsumerTarget Cheerfully Slashes 'Thousands' Of Prices — And Investors FretKroger's Hurricane-Less Outlook Adds To Amazon, Wal-Mart Fears

69,MS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average pared overnight losses Friday morning with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida. The U.S. dollar fell for a seventh straight session as Treasury yields neared the key 2% level.XS&P 500 and Dow futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat against fair value. The major market averages are trading modestly below all-time highs and slightly above their 50-day moving averages. The euro rose to its highest levels vs. the greenback in nearly three years while the Japanese yen set a 10-year highs. Gold futures continued to advance. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a 10-month low of2.03% after a sharp drop on Thursday.Not coincidentally, bank stocks were big losers on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) undercut a buy point, the SPDR Financial (XLF) bank ETF, fell below its 200-day line and industry leader Citigroup (C) dropped below its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) knifed below its 200-day moving avergage while Wells Fargo (WFC) and several superregional bank stocks hit 2017 lows.The current retreat is just one reason to steer clear of bank stocks. Hopes for tax cuts and other Trump agenda items continue to fade. Interest rates and yield spreads have steadily declined. And over the long term, bank stocks have not outperformed. The case for avoiding bank stocks was clear at the end of May; the evidence is even stronger today.Bank stocks briefly outperformed in late 2016, especially following President Trump's election win. But since early 2017 most banks began to follow the market, with clear underperformance in recent weeks, with several signals along the way.Bank stocks rallied after Election Day in part on hopes for sweeping tax cuts, which would lower their own IRS checks as well as bolster economic growth and interest rates, and accelerate Federal Reserve rate hikes. But the odds and timing of a tax hike have steadily declined, with Goldman Sachs now predicting that the odds of tax reform are down to 40%. On the positive front, the Trump administration is still making moves to ease crisis-era financial regulations, potentially freeing up capital for lending and buybacks.With the Trump agenda stalling, Treasury yields have been sliding for weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply on Thursday to fresh 2017 lows, in part due to euro gains on European Central Bank hints of tapering asset purchases. The yield is at its lowest levels since Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the spread between short-term and long-term yields has been falling sharply. That's bad news for banks, whose traditional profit model is borrowing short and lending long. It's also not a great sign for the economy when the yield curve flattens out.Bank stocks can be solid investments over certain periods, including right after the election. But they haven't tended to outperform the S&P 500 index significantly over time. Citigroup has been the best-performing U.S. bank stock in 2017, but its Relative Strength line is back about where it was at the start of the year. That means that Citi is trading even with the S&P 500 index. Looking further back, JPMorgan has been one of the better financials, but its shares haven't been long-term outperformers.Investors might be better off buying a broad index fund or ETF, which often will have financials as big holdings, to provide similar performance without the sector or single-stock risk.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Hold Serve, But Banks Face Break PointFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksThese 5 Dow Titans Are Near Buys In Bullish BasesTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stock News

Orbital ATK (OA) gapped up 21% in monster volume on news that Northrop Grumman (NOC) would acquire the company. Northrop rose 1.5% on the news.Strength in the group went beyond the acquisition. More than two dozen stocks in it advanced more than 1%.Blue chips were mostly up.

Citigroup (C) climbed about 2%, clearing a 69.96 buy point in volume 30% above average. Morgan Stanley (MS) padded its cushion above its 50-day line with a 1.7% gain. The best thing for the bank stocks would be an interest rate hike. But the Street isn't expecting one when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting Wednesday.Why then are bank stocks up today? Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the banks should benefit when the Fed starts unwinding its stimulus by reducing bond holdings.In the IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) gapped up for the second straight session. Friday's 6% gap up constituted a breakout above a 174.66 buy point. Midday Monday the stock gapped up 5%.China-based online gamer NetEase (NTES) jumped 7% in heavy volume but remains about 13% off its high.Brazil stocks continued to rally Monday, but many are beaten down.

73,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) sank Thursday after two U.S. House Democrats launched an investigation into the prices of multiple sclerosis drugs, which they say have nearly quadrupled since 2004.XU.S. Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch sent letters to seven drug firms, including Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen, Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi (SNY), Teva and EMD Serono, a subsidiary of Germany's Merck KGaA.""We believe no American should be forced to struggle to afford lifesaving medical treatments especially when drug companies increase prices without warning, cause or justification,"" Cummings and Welch wrote in a news release.Cummings and Welch cited an American Academy of Neurology study that says some drug companies appear to be increasing pricing, ""setting new, higher prices in lockstep with competitors"" — a phenomenon known as ""shadow pricing.""According to the study, sales of MS drugs more than doubled to nearly $9 billion in 2012 from $4 billion in 2008. At the same time, the annual cost of MS therapy rose to north of $60,000 annually per patient in 2015 from $16,050 per patient annually in 2004.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to get a handle on the MS landscape, put yourself in Rachel Martin's shoes. Her diagnosis in 1991 drastically changed the trajectory of her life. Head to IBD's Technology page for her story and what some of the newer MS drugs could mean for her and others living with MS.""By 2017, many of these drugs have increased in price to more than $85,000 per year,"" they wrote. ""One drug's price has increased by more than 1,000% since it was introduced.""Of the seven, Biogen has the largest swath of MS drugs — a total of six branded drugs that brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales in 2016. Teva, which sells one MS drug named Copaxone, made $4.2 billion in 2016 MS revenue.Novartis' and Sanofi's smaller arsenals brought in $3.1 billion and about $2 billion in 2016 sales. Roche is newer to the MS landscape and, in May, gained approval for a drug that can treat both primary progressive and relapsing-remitting forms of MS.Bayer confirmed receipt of the letter from Cummings and Welch to Investor's Business Daily, noting it plans ""to reply directly to the Congressmen."" Spokespeople from Biogen, Novartis and Teva also confirmed to IBD they had received letters and were determining how to best answer the request.""Bayer's commitment to the MS community goes back 25 years, and we continue to be dedicated to meeting the needs of patients,"" the company said in a statement.Said Teva: ""Earlier today Teva received a letter of inquiry from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which requests a significant amount of detailed analysis related to one of our products. We are currently analyzing the request in-depth, and plan to respond accordingly and fully cooperate with the committee to answer their questions.""Roche subsidiary Genentech confirmed receipt of the letter and said it would work with the Congressmen to address their requests. Ocrevus is priced about 20% below current average multiple sclerosis drug prices, Genentech said in a statement.""We also do not intend to follow the pattern of aggressive price increases that are typical for MS medicines,"" the firm said. ""We believe these are the best steps that we can take to help address the increasing cost of treating MS.""EMD Sereno said in an emailed statement it was reviewing the letter, adding: ""At EMD Serono, we recognize that there are concerns about affordability and access to innovative treatments and that there are many factors contributing to healthcare costs. We believe that patients should have access to quality care, and we are committed to ensuring that our products have broad formulary coverage and that patients can participate in comprehensive patient support programs.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen fell hardest, down 3.3% to close at 284.42. Teva followed, dipping 1.8%, near 17.20. Novartis lost 1.4% to 83.18. Bayer and Sanofi both lost 0.7% to 126.13 and 48.08, respectively.

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were nearly flat.Volume declined on the NYSE but rose on the Nasdaq compared with the same time in the previous session.Retail and oil groups dominated the day's list of leaders, despite their laggard price performance over the past six months.Oil and gas explorer Continental Resources (CLR) popped 3.5% in modestly higher volume. Going into Wednesday's session, the energy explorer group was No. 188 among 197 industry groups.

Target (TGT) added 2.5%, Costco (COST) 2%, Smart & Final (SFS) 2%, PriceSmart (PSMT) 1.5%, and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) 1%.

75,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) spiked to a three-week high Wednesday after an analyst upgraded the stock to a buy rating on its development of an Alzheimer's drug and noted ""overblown"" reaction to competition it faces in treating multiple sclerosis.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen gained 2.1% to 294.08, after rising as much as 3.1% in earlier trades. More broadly, biotech stocks lifted a fraction, coming back from relatively flat trading Tuesday.Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn upgraded Biogen to a buy rating from neutral, though he kept his 338 price target. Phase 3 data for its Alzheimer's drug, aducanumab, is expected in late 2019 or early 2020.This ""could be one of the first disease-modifying drugs to reach the market,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Flynn sees peak sales of $12 billion for aducanumab.Biogen partner Eisai is expected to have data from a Phase 2 trial of a similar drug by year's end, Flynn noted. The drug, known as BAN2401, was licensed to Eisai in a March 2014 deal with Biogen. The readout will provide a ""lateral catalyst"" for Biogen.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have struggled of late after hitting an 18-month high in late July. Long-term views look uncertain for several players, despite the fact many biotechs outperformed consensus views in the second quarter. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the breakdown.Both drugs are working to reduce the amount of amyloid deposits in the brain thought to be associated with Alzheimer's. Analysts will also look to see whether BAN2401 had an effect on cognition, Flynn wrote.In multiple sclerosis, Flynn sees investor worries of competition from Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Celgene (CELG) as overblown.Flynn, though, sees Biogen benefiting from royalty payments from Roche on its new multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus. Analysts have noted that Ocrevus is likely to take some share away from Biogen's other multiple-sclerosis drugs Tecfidera and Tysabri.RELATED:This Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugBiotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisWhy Biotechs outperformed Their Pharma Brethren In June Quarter

76,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS) unveiled a plan to boost revenue by $5 billion over the next three years, targeting growth across its operations as the trading business remains weak throughout the industry.XCOO Harvey Schwartz said at an industry conference Tuesday that trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) is ""still a pretty challenging environment"" and that the market so far in Q3 ""feels like the first and second quarter,"" according to the Financial Times.But he added that Goldman can lift annual FICC revenue by $1 billion, financing and lending revenue by $2 billion, investment management revenue by $1 billion, investment banking by $500 million, and equities client coverage by $500 million. The additional $5 billion at the top line should add $2.5 billion to pretax earnings.The breadth of the expected gains suggests Goldman may be looking beyond its vaunted trading desk to spark more growth, as persistent low market volatility continues to weigh on transactions.Earlier Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Q3 trading revenue would be down 20%.Dimon also dismissed Bitcoin as a fraud and vowed to immediately fire any trader who trades the cryptocurrency, which has soared in value in recent months.""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed,"" Dimon said, according to CNBC.Goldman shares closed up 2.2% on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average. JPMorgan rose 1.2%, Citigroup (C) climbed 1.6%, Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 1.31%, and Bank of America (BAC) added 2.5%, helped by another boost to bond yields.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.On Monday, Citigroup's CFO said markets revenue is on pace to come in roughly 15% lower than a year ago.JPMorgan and Citi had previously hinted at weak Q3 performance, and last month, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said the low volatility seen in Q2 has spilled over into Q3, after reporting a 40% drop in Q2 FICC revenue.On its Q2 earnings call in July, Goldman said it ""didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to or as well as we have in the past,"" echoing similar language on its Q1 call, when trading also suffered.The underperformance helped rival Morgan Stanley briefly surpass Goldman in market value, as its Q2 fixed-income trading revenue fell only 4%.RELATED:Bitcoin Dips Amid China's Currency Crackdown; Kin ICO ComingBig Banks Aren't Ignoring Bitcoin Anymore, Still WaryBofA, Goldman Beat But See Trading, Net Interest Income WeaknessFrustrated JPMorgan CEO Unleashes This Tirade On U.S. 'Stupidity'

77,MS,"Roku, the maker of devices and software for streaming video that was an early challenger to traditional home-entertainment providers, filed for a U.S. initial public offering, it was learned Friday.The company listed an initial offering size of $100 million, which it said is a placeholder used to calculate fees and will probably change. The company plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes including research and development and marketing spending, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Roku was an early mover in what is now a crowded market of home devices and streaming tools. It's a specialist in an industry in which several technology giants, including Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN) are now focusing intently.The company, which has been losing money since it began in 2002, acknowledges the risk of the ""highly competitive"" market, according to its regulatory filing, but its advantage is in its neutrality. Unlike some of the other players, it isn't competing with content providers by making original programming.""Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem,"" Chief Executive Officer Anthony Wood wrote in the filing.Roku said it made $11.22 in average revenue per user in the four quarters ended on June 30 compared with $9.28 at the end of 2016. The company said its growth strategy is to increase the number of active accounts and the amount of money it makes per user.Roku had 15.1 million active accounts using its streaming services as of June 30, according to the filing. For the six months ended June 30, Roku had revenue of $199.7 million, a 23 percent increase from the same period in 2016, according to the filing.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) are leading the offering, which will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ROKU.

79,MS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) rocketed Monday after announcing a former Novo Nordisk (NVO) executive will take the helm at Teva, just seven months after its last full-time chief executive resigned amid a bribery scandal.Hours later, Teva said it's selling its Paragard implantable contraceptive to CooperSurgical for $1.1 billion in cash. Paragard brought in $168 million in the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, Teva said in a news release. The deal includes Teva's manufacturing site in Buffalo, N.Y.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva catapulted 19.4% to 18.50 to touch a high last seen in early August. Teva led IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group, which rose 1.3% to its highest point since July 26.Kare Schultz will become Teva's president and CEO, Teva said in a press release. Schultz will take over for interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg. Peterburg assumed control in February after former head Erez Vigodman resigned amid two bribery probes by U.S. regulators.Schultz comes from Danish drugmaker Lundbeck where he worked president and chief executive for two years. Before that, he spent nearly three decades at Novo Nordisk in a slew of roles, including chief operating officer.At Lundbeck, Schultz is credited with leading a restructuring effort and turnaround that put the firm on track of achieving record sales and profit, Teva said. He also previously worked at McKinsey and Anderson Consulting.In addition to the sale of Paragard, Teva said it's actively working to sell its the remaining pieces of its women's health business as well as oncology and pain businesses in Europe. Teva expects to generate at least $2 billion in total proceeds from the sale of these businesses as well as other asset sales to be wrapped by year's end.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a low IBD Composite Rating of 4 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it lags most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at drugmakers with better ratings.Teva shares have been in a slump over the past two years.Teva is the No. 1 generic drugmaker by market cap, but one of its biggest concerns is a branded drug named Copaxone to treat multiple sclerosis. A judge tossed out four key patents on Copaxone earlier this year, meaning generic competition is likely in 2018.In February, Vigodman left Teva in a wake of controversy and, since then, analysts said Teva has lacked direction. In July, it looked possible AstraZeneca (AZN) Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship to take the top job at Teva, but those rumors quickly died down.Last month, Teva crashed 40% over three days after delivering consensus-lagging sales and profit for the second quarter. Generic drug stocks broadly traded down over the course of 12 days after lackluster reports from Teva and No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL).RELATED:Teva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key DrugsBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeGeneric Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-Fall

Institutional securities net revenue rose 4% to $4.76 billion as fixed income trading revenue fell modestly to $1.2 billion and equity trading revenue ticked up to $2.2 billion. Both were better than expected. Wealth management revenue climbed 9% to $4.15 billion. Investment banking revenue rose 25% to $1.53 billion.""Our second quarter results demonstrated the resilience of our franchise in a subdued trading environment,"" said Chairman and CEO James Gorman in a statement.Stock: Shares rose 3.3% to 46.62 on the stock market today, moving back above a 46.08 buy point. Morgan Stanley crossed that entry in early July had pulled back in recent sessions amid concerns about rival banks' earnings or outlooks.The results follow cautious outlooks in the months to come from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) on trading. The big banks' trading operations across-the-board were muted in the second quarter due to the absence of Brexit or Trump-like convulsions.JPMorgan also remained conservative on its views for future loan growth and net interest income. Loan growth has slowed, possibly as businesses grow more hesitant to expand, while lower long-term bond yields have hung over net-interest income as enthusiasm about potential long-term economic growth wanes.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs' Q2 results showed that its large trading operations took a hit — the second straight quarter the bank has misjudged market action. Bank of America (BAC), which also reported Tuesday, also reported net interest income that underwhelmed some analysts.RELATED:

86,MS,"Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) turned out earnings that beat analyst estimates on Tuesday, but concerns about net interest income and trading continued to cast a shadow over the financial industry.XJPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) on Friday signaled caution on the trading environment, while JPMorgan cut its full-year outlook for growth in net interest income — or the difference between the money banks bring in on loans and other products and what they pay out. JPMorgan also tempered its expectations for loan growth.The results come as long-term optimism about the economy becomes more tempered, weighing on long-term interest rates, bond yields and, in turn, net interest income.Hopes that President Trump would charge into office and quickly deregulate have also dimmed amid investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia on the presidential election.Bank of America's second-quarter earnings per share rose 12% to 46 cents, beating by 3 cents, as revenue rose 7% to $22.8 billion, topping estimates for $21.915 billion.Net interest income was $11 billion, while net interest margin was 2.34%, though those figures were below some forecasts.The results, CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement, came despite ""modest economic growth of 2%.""""The margin miss could weigh on shares today but ... should not be a surprise following peer results released last week, in our view,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.Shares fell 0.5% to 23.90 in the stock market today, testing support at their 50-day average. The stock is also close to a buy point of 24.45 in a shallow cup-with-handle base. JPMorgan dipped 0.35% to 91.04, still in range from an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. Citigroup rose 0.1%, extended from its breakout in early June.Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, reported EPS of $3.95, up 6% and beating expectations for a drop to $3.51. Revenue edged lower to $7.89 billion but still came in above forecasts for $7.57 billion.Fixed-income, currency and commodities revenue plunged 40% to $1.159 billion, due to what the company said was ""a challenging environment characterized by low levels of volatility, low client activity and generally difficult market-making conditions.""Or, as a Nomura-Instinet research note on Goldman's earnings put it, ""Hair in the FICC Butter May Trump 2Q Beat.""Goldman shares fell 2.4% to 223.86, testing their 50- and 200-day lines. Morgan Stanley (MS), which reports earnings on Wednesday, eased 1% to 44.85 and is working on a 46.08 buy point.The big banks had already signaled that trading revenue, which makes up a good part of Goldman's business, would be lower for the second quarter, when there were fewer surprises to shock the market into action. Results Friday from JPMorgan and Citigroup confirmed that guidance.The current quarter may not provide much relief. Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said potential seasonal weakness during the third quarter could weigh on some banks' results.And JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake on Friday said the bank was lapping what was a strong third quarter for trading last year.""And so while that isn't guidance, it is context, as this quarter has felt quiet, more like prior years,"" she said.RELATED:After JPMorgan Slips, Morgan Stanley Nears Buy With EPS On TapUnitedHealth Set For Record High After Strong Earnings, Raised Full-Year TargetThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsThese 5 Top S&P 500 Stocks Near Buy Points Have Earnings This Week

87,MS,"Life was simple for Rachel Martin in 1991. By day, she worked at an accounting firm on her way to becoming a CPA, and by night she ran -- until she started to notice her feet felt strangely stiff.XThat led to three bits of news one day soon after. Two were good, yet the odds still stacked up against her. ""That day I got notice of the multiple sclerosis, I got notice we sold our condo and I got notice of receiving my CPA license,"" she told Investor's Business Daily.The numbers haven't gone Martin's way ever since. She was 27 when diagnosed, half a lifetime ago. She hasn't worked for 23 years and has spent zero hours of her life working as a CPA. She's taken at least four medications to treat her MS, and exactly none have fully contained the ailment.A barrage of new drugs are taking aim at MS, however, offering hope for Martin and others with the debilitating illness. The medications are offering the lower costs you might expect when a market heats up, but they offer prospects for fewer side effects and, most critically, greater effectiveness.Several heavy hitters in the industry are getting involved in this biopharma battle. Roche (RHHBY) has a new drug that could swipe share from market leader Biogen (BIIB). Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG) and a number of generic-drug manufacturers are expected to pile the pressure on another mainstay in the field, Novartis (NVS).Roche shares were down fractionally Monday to close at 32.15 while Biogen ticked up 0.6% to finish at 234.70. Celgene was up marginally to 137.84 while Novartis was down slightly to 84.29.The MS sector has been dominated by Biogen, which brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales during 2016 with six medications in its arsenal. Included in its inventory is one MS drug that Martin recently stopped using, Avonex, as well as two other top sellers, Tysabri and Tecfidera.Now there's ""a paradigm shift,"" especially where Roche's MS drug, Ocrevus, is concerned, according to Michael DiFiore, analyst for Evercore. Ocrevus was approved earlier this year as a treatment for both relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive forms of MS. Offering medication for primary progressive is a breakthrough, since that form of MS comprises just 10% of the market and has not been targeted by treatments in the past.Ocrevus' twice-a-year infusion looks attractive for patients like Martin, who discontinued using certain drugs due to MS-related tremors. Martin's first medication was an interferon in 1994. She was on the medicine for 22 months until the shaking in her hands became so severe that she couldn't administer the injection.Analysts say Roche's drug puts Biogen's Tysabri and Tecfidera at the greatest risk of market share loss. Some Wall Street estimates see Ocrevus taking away 40%-50% of Tysabri sales and 30%-40% of Tecfidera revenue over three to four years.""With Ocrevus on the market, you have the threat of share being stolen,"" DiFiore told IBD. ""You also have the possibility of looking at generic versions of (Novartis') Gilenya and (Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA)) Copaxone. So there's a lot of moving parts.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 438-company Biotech industry group is now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked as shares have risen 23% for the year, riding high on a June rally that could still see another 15% upside, according to some estimates. Who could benefit in that spike? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In Novartis' case, Celgene is heaping pressure on the company with a potential blockbuster MS drug that now has the test-phase name of ozanimod. Celgene, the No. 2 biotech in market cap is billing ozanimod as a safer version of Gilenya and is targeting the latter half of 2017 to file an application for approval with the Food and Drug Administration.Both ozanimod and Gilenya belong to the class of drugs called S1P receptor modulators. They work by preventing specific white blood cells from moving into the central nervous system. Doing so has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce MS relapses.MS is a disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. Patients fatigue easily and have difficulty walking.""I went from running to walking, to the walker, and then to a wheelchair,"" said Martin. It wasn't muscular ability, she adds, it was balance.""I was able to exercise if I held on to something,"" she said.Medications have brought Martin moderate success to the point where she can generally walk with a cane. She belongs to an MS group called Let's Play in Los Angeles, and her disease is ""steady,"" says her doctor. But it took time in physical therapy and experimentation with four medicines.One medicine caused debilitating headaches. Another was a chemotherapy that, today, doctors know can cause heart damage. Martin managed to avoid that.Martin's current medication is Extavia, made by Bayer (BAYRY) and sold by Novartis. It requires a self-injection every other day. She began using that medicine in April when she quit using Biogen's Avonex after five years, due to headaches.Biogen has the most to lose in this battle with sales of Tysabri, Tecfidera and Avonex on the line. The second quarter is expected to be Biogen's first real test, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. Results are due to be reported Tuesday.Like Biogen's drug Tysabri, Roche's Ocrevus is considered a highly efficient MS treatment. But Tysabri's label contains a black box warning against a deadly virus that attacks the brain. Ocrevus' label doesn't.One case of that virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, also called PML, has been recorded by a single Ocrevus user. But that patient had just come off Tysabri after three years and had only been treated once with Ocrevus. Most analysts don't consider the case to be related to Ocrevus.The risk of PML is likely enough to prod a number of Tysabri patients to switch to Ocrevus, Syed said. Further, Biogen has estimated that a third of patients on Tysabri test positive for an ailment known as the John Cunningham virus. Those patients have weak immune systems and are more susceptible to PML.Analysts say erosion of Tysabri use will be slow. And Biogen isn't particularly worried about its MS franchise. The franchise grew 2.9% in 2016 and expanded to include Zinbryta, launched with partner AbbVie (ABBV). In the first quarter ended March 31, Biogen's MS drug sales grew just 3.1% as all but sales of Tysabri and Zinbryta fell.Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos doesn't see Biogen's MS drugs as a declining franchise, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a June 29 note to clients after a meeting with Vounatsos.""He believes Biogen may lose some market share (to Roche's Ocrevus) but believes there will be 'plenty of opportunities to grow top line,' "" Raffat said. Vounatsos ""does not believe generic Copaxone (Teva's drug) or generic Gilenya (Novartis' drug) will impact Biogen's MS franchise.""Copaxone and Gilenya face their own battles from Celgene and others. Celgene's ozanimod successfully reduced relapse rates vs. traditional interferon treatment in a Phase 3 trial that the company presented in May. Both 0.5-milligram and 1-milligram oral doses were safe and tolerable over a two-year period.Novartis' Gilenya also has its ""own safety issues,"" Mizuho's Syed said. Per the label, patients must undergo monitoring for six hours immediately following their first dose to ensure that their heart rates don't slow to dangerous levels. Gilenya has also been shown to have a toxic effect on liver enzymes.""So Gilenya was not a perfect drug,"" he said. ""(Celgene) said this is a safer Gilenya. We just saw top-line data for ozanimod. That's going to come onto the market, if it gets approved, in 2018.""So ozanimod, if successful, could gouge some of Gilenya's sales, analysts say. In the second quarter, Gilenya sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis to $837 million. That followed major growth in 2016, up 14%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, to $3.1 billion.Celgene is optimistic about its chances in the multiple sclerosis market. In a May 30 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted that management hasn't committed to first-dose monitoring but says a unique dosing schedule could minimize the need for the requirement.""On safety, Celgene management expects to show multiple points of safety differentiation from Gilenya's safety profile and to have a label that will be consistent with its Phase 2 results,"" he said.Then there's the potential generic competition that Novartis faces in 2019. A slew of generics have been approved pending patent litigation from the likes of Teva and Mylan (MYL). Analyst consensus models see $1.92 billion in 2018 Gilenya sales dropping to $447 million in 2020.""If there's nine generics approved tentatively (for Gilenya), that's a price point that's waiting to break,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a May 7 video. But Raffat says it's unlikely Gilenya will go generic in 2019. Patent litigation will likely push generic entry to 2020.And even then, Gilenya has a patent set to expire in 2027 that hasn't really been vetted, he says. The 2027 patent covers the dosing schedule and it only currently faces one challenge. Earlier, it stood up to a challenge from Apotex.Novartis is also studying a low-dose version of Gilenya at 0.25 milligrams. Gilenya is now approved as a 0.5-milligram dose.""If this trial works, it's likely very patentable,"" Raffat said. ""As of 2010 when the FDA reviewed it, the FDA said it's not clear the 0.25-milligram dose will work. That alone is your reason of knowing if the 0.25-milligram (dose) does work (in Novartis' trial), it is patentable because it's not obvious.""A new patent on Gilenya would be another obstacle to generic competition, Evercore's DiFiore said, noting ""that could nullify Gilenya going generic in 2019"" and help the broader MS industry stave off cheaper generics tugging down on drug pricing across the market.Ultimately, the competition could be a godsend for patients like Martin who are hopeful for better MS medicines with fewer side effects.""(Multiple sclerosis is) something that's difficult to describe to people because most of us look like we're doing well,"" Martin said. ""It's like a bubble. I look fine on the outside, but inside I don't feel fine.""RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill Novartis' MS Drug Stomp Celgene's Before It Even Hits The Market?How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

96,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that much of the bank's post-Brexit fate in the U.K. was up to the European Union, and he noted the risk that could come from central banks' moves to put the brakes on quantitative easing.The remarks, made at a conference in Paris, came ahead of the bank's second-quarter earnings, set to be reported on Friday. Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also report then.""We've never had QE like this before,"" Dimon said in video available on Bloomberg, referring to the quantitative easing — or central banks' purchases of government bonds and other securities in attempt to shore up markets after the financial crisis and recession a decade ago. ""We've never had unwinding like this before. Obviously, that should say something to you about the risk that might mean.""IBD'S TAKE: Weaker trading seems likely to hurt banks when their second-quarter earnings kick off, but one analyst cites a few big longer-term catalysts investors can look forward to.""I think the reversal of the actual monetary, you know, selling securities in the marketplace, I think when that happens of size or substance, it could be a little more disruptive than people think,"" Dimon added. ""Again if the economies are growing, it's not that big a deal. But again, it's never happened before.""The Federal Reserve has signaled that it will soon start paring its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, perhaps as soon as September, by letting maturing bonds run off instead of reinvesting the funds. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is hinting that it may start reducing bond buys soon.At the conference, Dimon also said that the bank needed to ""be prepared for hard Brexit"" — or a full, clean divorce between the United Kingdom and the EU. The U.K. voted to leave the bloc last year.But he said that was easy to plan for that. ""Several hundred jobs or hundreds of jobs"" would have to be done through an EU subsidiary, he said. Locations in Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg could carry out most of the bank's operations, he said.He said there were 16,000 JPMorgan employees in the U.K., but that three quarters of them serviced EU companies. And he said what the bank's operations ultimately looked like in the wake of Brexit, after an initial round of relocations, would be up to the bloc's regulators.""What happens next is totally up to EU. It's not up to Britain."" he said. He added: ""If the EU determines over time that they want to start to move a lot more jobs out of London into the EU, they can simply dictate that.""JPMorgan, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 0.4% to 92.83 in the stock market today, still within a 5% chase zone of an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. Bank of America (BAC) slid 1.2% to 24.60, as it makes its way through a flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.1% to 45.48.

Analysts see earnings of $7.10 a share with revenue of $75.71 billion.

But other major projects are expected to miss.IMS data suggest Biogen's multiple-sclerosis drugs Tysabri and Tecfidera could beat Porges' estimates by 18.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Tecfidera, however, is expected to miss the Street by 1.3% and MS drugs Plegridy and Avonex are forecast to be light.This comes amid growing competition in the MS field from the likes of Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved earlier this year to treat both relapsing-remitting as well as primary progressive MS — a first for the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, as sentiment ticks up ahead of the second-quarter earnings season. Make sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News for the latest on the sector.Major drugs from Celgene are expected to top the consensus by 4.9% with chemotherapy Revlimid likely to come in 5.1% above the consensus, Porges wrote. Pomalyst, a drug to treat a blood cancer, is expected to be 5.8% higher than the consensus.Gilead is likely to be the biggest second-quarter surprise. Per IMS data, Gilead's sales could top by 10%, ""though this is largely dependent upon the reliability of recent hepatitis C data, which have been unreliable in the past."" Hepatitis C drug sales toppled in 2016 amid high cure rates.Without accounting for highly variable sales of hepatitis C drugs, Gilead's total sales would miss Porges' forecast by 0.1% and the analyst consensus target by 1.7%. At the same time, Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV drug, could beat the consensus by 7%-9%, Porges wrote in a note to clients.Amgen (AMGN) is most likely to match or slightly underperform the consensus, Porges said. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is expected to be in line with consensus views, though it could top Porges' view by as much as 1.9%, per IMS data.Bone health drug Prolia and bone marrow stimulating Aranesp are projected to beat by 6%-7%, which could help offset expected sales misses by bone health drug Xgeva and other bone marrow stimulant drugs, Porges said.""However, the changing price dynamic for many of Amgen's products makes the IMS adjustment factors less reliable,"" Porges wrote. He calls for Amgen to hike some of its prices in July after bumping the price of cancer drug Kyprolis by 3.9% in April.On the adjusted profits per share side, Gilead has a chance to beat consensus views by 11.1%, Porges said. Regeneron and Vertex could also top expectations by 8.1% and 7%, respectively.But Biogen could miss earnings views by 10.6% due to a one-time research-and-development expense not fully recognized across analysts' estimates, Porges said. AbbVie, too, is likely to miss adjusted earnings per share by 3.2%, he said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was down fractionally.RELATED:Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystWhy This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June

Apple has risen for several sessions but closed just below its 50-day line at 149.04.)Bank of America is in a cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point of 25.21. BofA fell 1.7% to 24.21 on Friday as investors reacted to earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC). But BofA closed near the upper end half of its daily range.

105,MS,"Weaker trading seems likely to dent the big banks' second-quarter earnings, but several bigger, long-term positives are starting to fall into line longer-term for the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Buckingham Research said Thursday in boosting the price targets for those banks and others.XJPMorgan Chase hit a record high, but pulled back to the top of its buy range. Morgan Stanley (MS) is just above a buy point.  Bank of America is closing in on a conventional entry after already clearing an aggressive buy point. Wells Fargo (WFC), still trying to bounce back from the fake accounts scandal, is building the right side of a base.Citigroup (C), already extended from buy range, and still-basing Goldman Sachs (GS) also were among those getting price target hikes.The U.S.' largest banks stand to benefit from better global growth, with interest rates set to drift higher as many central banks signal a winding down of easy monetary policy, Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell said in a research note.""After years of fits and starts ... we now seem to be experiencing synchronous global economic growth for the first time since the financial crisis,"" he wrote.Other long-term positives, he said, included a recent Treasury Department report that ""indicates to us that significant benefits from deregulation are increasingly likely.""The Treasury Department, in a report last month, called for broad regulatory rollbacks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said about 80% of those potential changes could be done via regulators, according to Reuters.The payout hikes following the results last month from the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, Mitchell said, also showed ""a clear path toward reducing excess capital"".""Given these potential tailwinds (combined with positive optionality on a corporate tax cut), we see multiple expansion potential for the group and recommend investors be buyers on dips,"" Mitchell said.Still, Mitchell lowered his second-quarter earnings-per-share estimates for 10 banks by a median 2.4%, citing tamer fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading.The absence of market-turning events, like last year's Brexit vote in the U.K. or President Trump's election in the U.S., contributed to a quieter trading environment for the big banks during the second quarter.JPMorgan, whose target price was raised to 100 from 94 by Buckingham, fell 0.3% to 93.38 in the stock market today after setting a record 94.51 intraday. That's just within the 5% chase zone from an 89.23 double-bottom buy point.Bank of America, whose target price was raised to 30 from 27, reversed for a 0.8% drop to 24.71. That stock is in a flat base with a 25.90 entry. But BofA already crossed a 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley, raised to 54 from 51, dipped 2 cents to 46.14, but holding Wednesday's breakout from a 46.08 entry.Wells Fargo, raised to 62 from 60, sank 0.4% 55.56. Wells currently has a 60.09 buy point. The stock is working on a handle that could become valid at Friday's close, presenting a lower buy point.Citigroup, raised to 81 from 70, fell 1.2% to 67.63. Goldman Sachs, raised to 243 from 235, dipped 0.6% to 26.69.RELATED:Here's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking DowHere Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading WoesJPMorgan CEO Signals Patience As Trump's Growth Agenda Stalls

Nike is about 2% below its 59.10 flat-base entry after last week's strong breakout on earnings. Raymond James labeled the retail company a ""top pick"" due to its popularity with millennials.On the downside, Walt Disney (DIS) and General Electric (GE) fell more than 1% apiece.A number of investment banks saw their price targets boosted early Thursday at Buckingham Research. Morgan Stanley's (MS) price target was raised to 54 from 51, while Dow stock JPMorgan's (JPM) was moved up to 100 from 94.

Many of these top-rated stocks had strong run-ups, but dipped in June.Managers of leading funds were snatching up tech stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), IPG Photonics (IPGP), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Medidata Solutions (MDSO). Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA), YY (YY) and NetEase (NTES) were also favored by top-notch funds. A small handful of telecom issues being added include Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) and Lumentum Holdings (LITE).Leading funds continued to ease into select retailers, such as Stamps.com (STMP), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), Domino's Pizza (DPZ).

The warrant was purchased for $5 billion preferred stocks in 2011. Having Warren Buffett as a major shareholder will likely boost investor confidence in the money center bank.Like most banks and financial stocks, BofA soared after the presidential election amid expectations of pro-growth policies and interest rate hikes. After hitting a 52-week high of 25.90 on March 2, the stock has consolidated, etching a cup-shaped base. It's currently building the right side of the base with no handle just yet, but nearing its pivot of 25.90.Morgan Stanley (MS) was another money center bank on top funds' shopping list.

The focus is expected to be on any hint about the timing of a reduction in the Fed's bond portfolio.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1%.

The four stocks are 10% to 15% off recent highs.Going into Wednesday's session, the chip sector was No. 4 of 33 sectors. While that's a good reading, it represented the first time the chip sector was not in the top three since March 1. In the second half of February, just before the chips moved into the top three, the bank sector held the top spot.Banks are now No. 9, up from No. 24 at the beginning of June. A handful of the money-center banks are near 52-week highs, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Morgan Stanley (MS).JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley could be positioned for breakouts.

Both are in second-stage bases.Many of the banks are forming or have recently formed bases. The stages are mostly first or second stage. As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate.

111,MS,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Monday unexpectedly surged to 57.8 from 54.9 in May, as the factory sector shifted into faster growth. That's the highest level since mid-2014.XWall Street economists expected the ISM gauge to edge up to 55. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.The new orders index jumped to 63.5 from 59.5, while the current production gauge climbed to 62.4 from 57.1. The employment gauge jumped to 57.2 from 53.5.The 10-year Treasury yield — which hit a six-week high last week amid some more hawkish central-bank signals than anticipated, especially from the European Central Bank — rose further after the manufacturing report.The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed lower following the ISM report, but the financial-heavy Dow Jones industrial average held up. The Nasdaq closed down 0.5% while the Dow rose 0.6%.The recovery in Treasury yields has coincided with investors showing renewed interest in bank stocks, among the big winners of the first phase of the Trump postelection rally. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) cleared an aggressive buy point at 24.45, while Morgan Stanley (MS) was close to a 46.08 buy point. Financials were again in a leadership position on Monday, with Bank of America up 1.7% to 24.68 and Morgan Stanley up 2.4% to 45.61 on the stock market today, outpacing the Dow.The ISM report wasn't expected to be much of a market mover, but the strength caught Wall Street by surprise.

112,MS,"A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday.Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology. Analysts have been quick to offer up Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) as potential acquisition targets.Others have said Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would be a smart buy to help fend off a larger dip in its hepatitis C franchise. But Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young expects Gilead's Harvoni, a key hepatitis C drug, to beat analysts' second-quarter models.For the period, she models Gilead pulling in $6.34 billion in sales, just north of the consensus, and $2.18 adjusted income per share, topping broader forecasts by a nickel. She expects a $110 million beat on U.S. Harvoni sales, at $857 million. That would still be down 7% year over year.Young also expects Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV medication, to top Wall Street views for U.S. sales of $694 million. She models $781 million for the period and sees total prescriptions growing 17% quarter over quarter vs. consensus expectations for just 4% growth.""However, we don't expect shares to react strongly to a beat since we think investors are looking for Gilead to do a deal,"" she wrote in a note clients.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs are likely to struggle this year as investor focus turns to smaller, cancer- and rare-disease-focused biotechs, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies are piquing analyst interest.Biogen (BIIB) also will be in the limelight as investors look for a strategic update and plans for growth amid heightened competition in the multiple sclerosis arena. No. 1 drugmaker Roche (RHHBY), in March, gained approval of its drug Ocrevus to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis.Young sees Biogen's key MS drugs, Tecfidera and Tysabri, pulling in-line sales, though her long-term numbers are below the Street. For the quarter, Young forecasts in-line total sales at $2.8 billion, but sees adjusted profits missing views at $4.04 a share to consensus' views for $4.50. Biogen is scheduled to report Q2 results and give a strategic update on July 25.For the strategic update, she looks for Biogen to give some insight into its collaboration with Eisai as well as newly seated Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos' long-term vision for the company. Investors also likely will want an update on Alzheimer's drug aducanumab.""We think investors are hoping to hear that the company will give an interim readout on the aducanumab Phase 3 trial next year,"" she said. ""For some we think it will make them want to own, but for others they may want to wait until after the data.""Incyte could beat on the top line from strong Jakafi sales, but investor focus will likely be on its immuno-oncology drug epacadostat and strategic partnerships with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). Incyte is set to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 1.More broadly, Young expects an in-line quarter for large-cap biotechs. She sees Amgen (AMGN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Vertex and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) reporting metrics in line with consensus views.RELATED:Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystAre Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

113,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who is prone to moments of bluntness and irritation on earnings calls, railed against what he characterized as growing U.S. bureaucracy, litigiousness, and an inability to modernize infrastructure, while other countries adopt measures intended to unlock growth.X""It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies that promote business and growth is good for the average citizen of those countries for jobs and wages, and that somehow, this great American free-enterprise system, we no longer get it,"" he told analysts Friday.When asked at what point dysfunction in Washington, D.C., starts to hurt confidence and frustrate clients, Dimon said that JPMorgan has managed to grow ""in spite of stupidity and political gridlock"" since the recession because the U.S. economy's fundamentals were still intact.But the contrast with other nations' policies intended to spur growth is wearing on Dimon, while Wall Street continues to wait for the Trump administration to unchain the banks.""It's almost an embarrassment, being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country,"" he said.The remarks came three months after Dimon advised being patient with Trump and just after the bank reported strong second-quarter results. Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported on Friday.While JPMorgan's results beat analyst views, the bank's outlook has dimmed. The company lowered its full-year forecast for net-interest income growth — to around $4 billion from $4.5 billion — and signaled that tough comparisons for trading remained on the horizon. The bank also sees core loan growth being ""modestly lower"" than once expected.CFO Marianne Lake reminded analysts on the call that the third quarter for trading last year was particularly strong. That wasn't ""guidance,"" she said, but it was ""context.""The big banks had already warned that trading would be weak for the second quarter, partly because of a lack of what Lake has called ""idiosyncratic events,"" such as the U.K.'s vote last year to leave the European Union and President Trump's surprise election, which jolted trading activity last year.Lake also characterized the Fed's unwinding of its balance sheet as ""a downside risk, not a probability.""Shares of JPMorgan closed down 0.9% at 92.25 in the stock market today. The stock is in range from a double-bottom base buy point of 89.23. Weak retail sales and consumer price index data also weighed on bond yields, which in turn weigh on banks because they can serve as a gauge for inflation expectations. Citigroup fell 0.45% to 66.72, and Wells Fargo dropped 1.1% to 54.99.The second quarter was marked not just by weak trading. Lukewarm business-loan growth was also seen, along with lower long-term interest rates, which have tumbled as the Trump administration struggles to push through its economic agenda and tear away financial regulations.JPMorgan reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.82, up 17%, on a 5% revenue increase to $26.405 billion, compared to Zacks estimates for EPS of $1.57 and revenue of $24.84 billion.Markets revenue fell 14%, with fixed-income trading down 19% and equities down 1%. Average core loans grew 8% year over year but 2% quarter to quarter.

115,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial (PNC) are expected to confirm on Friday that financials had a lackluster second quarter, yet bank stocks are near long-time highs.XBanks have largely telegraphed declines in their trading results, which have been hurt by calmer markets and muted client activity. JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake, at a conference in May, said that there had been fewer ""idiosyncratic events"" to jolt trade in Q2 — think recent populist agitation like Brexit or President Trump's election — and that more such incidents were were needed.Other difficulties could hang over the results. The Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes have helped push up short-term interest rates. But long-term interest rates also fell during the quarter as doubts grew over Trump's ability to carry out an agenda intended to spur long-term growth, a story from Dow Jones noted this month.The banks' earnings, which are expected to be roughly flat except for PNC Financial, will also come after lending activity cooled in the first quarter. Gains in the 10-year Treasury yield — which influences the value of mortgages and other types of credit — slowed for much of the quarter.But bank stocks have been faring well in recent weeks. JPMorgan and Citigroup have hit longtime highs, while Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo and PNC Financial, among others, are near buy points.""July earnings will feel like the middle of the swimming test with 60 seconds of treading water,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a research note. ""You're looking forward to the freestyle sprint up next.""""Deregulation is the next catalyst for the money centers,"" she added, referring to the global money center banks.Analysts' hopes have been raised by a recent Treasury Department report that called for broad financial deregulation  — much of which could be pushed through without congressional approval, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said. Growth could also come as the administration installs people in top regulatory positions who are more sympathetic to the financial industry.Estimates: Wall Street expects earnings per share to increase 1% to $1.57, with revenue rising 2% to $24.483 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, during the bank's first-quarter earnings call, played down the softer trends in loans, saying that companies had options beyond loans to expand, such as deals or bonds.Factors to watch, beyond broader industry trends, include Dimon's take on Brexit, the health of the consumer, and the company's luxury Sapphire Reserve card, said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg in a research note.JPMorgan stock rose 0.6% to 93.10 in Thursday stock market trading, still in range from an 89.23 double-bottom buy point. JPMorgan hit a record intraday high of 94.51 on July 6.EPS is expected to fall 3% to $1.21, with revenue down 1% to $17.320 billion.Goldberg said that Citigroup's investment banking segment has been strong, even in Europe, where recent elections and Brexit have been sources of anxiety. And he said he expected the bank to emphasize the progress of its credit card investments, including a co-branded deal with Costco (COST). Still, questions remain about the write-down Citigroup might take on its deferred tax assets if tax cuts make it through Congress.Citi's results will also come days before the company's first investor day since before the financial crisis.""Its earnings call could serve as a preview to its Investor Day on July 25 (first in over 9 years), where we expect management to lay out a more detailed blueprint to higher investor returns,"" Goldberg said.Shares climbed 10 cents to 67.02. Citi rose to 68.91 on July 3, the highest since January 2009.EPS is seen up 1% to $1.02; revenue is expected to edge up 0.6% to $22.287 billion.Barclays analysts said that the brunt of the fallout from Wells' sham-account scandal — in which reams of fake accounts were created in an attempt to hit sales goals in a high-pressure environment — may be in the past. However, the firm said that bad press could still ""persist for some time.""Others suggest that if the bank turns out strong loan growth, those troubles could shrink further into the past.""For WFC, we expect a rebound in loan growth will help buoy investor concerns about lost business momentum at the company, and this should drive shares higher if there is no collapse in the net interest margin,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.Wells Fargo rose 0.8% to 55.60. Shares climbed 0.2% to 55.17 on Wednesday. Wells is in a cup-with-handle base with a 56.70 buy point.Wall Street expects EPS of $2.01, a 10% increase, on revenue of $4.001 billion, up around 0.6%.Shares climbed 0.1% to 127.32 Thursday.

Analysts expect Facebook to post earnings growth of 42%, and see Alibaba generating a 26% gain. Wall Street sees flat growth for Tesla in Q2 and Goldman Sachs (GS) said the electric car pioneer's stock is extremely overpriced.But new names on the list include a leader in self-driving-car technology, Nvidia; a South Korean maker of LCD panels, LG Display (LPL); and 2017 IPO Floor & Decor.LG Display tops the list with analysts expecting explosive earnings growth of 944%. The stock had already been rising in recent weeks when it jumped even higher on news that Apple (AAPL) is in talks with LG Display to invest in the display-maker's new OLED screen factory. The stock pulled back on Friday to close down nearly 2% for the week.After a solid run from its April 27 initial public offering, Floor & Decor has been pulling back recently, but managed to close the week in positive territory. Given its fundamentals, including 96% average earnings growth over the last three quarters and 35% three-year annual sales growth, it's one to keep an eye on. For Q2, analysts expect a 260% rise in earnings-per-share.Alibaba has invested in fellow Chinese e-commerce stock Baozun, which analysts expect to deliver 400% earnings growth in its next report. The stock is already extended from an earlier breakout and was up over 13% this week. See if it goes on to offer another buying opportunity.Nvidia, which is also extended beyond a proper buy zone, is expected to deliver 68% EPS growth. While self-driving car technology leader pulled back recently, it's managed to stay above its 10-week line and closed over 1% higher for the week.Heavy construction firm MasTec (MTZ) is also noteworthy. On Thursday, it briefly poked its head above a 46.15 buy point, but then pulled back as the indexes also encountered selling pressure. On Friday, the stock rose over 1% to close at 45.90. The Florida-based company is expected to report in early August, with analysts looking for earnings growth of 81%.The trick to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watchlist and action plan.

124,MS,"Earnings for the second quarter kick off in earnest next week with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on the docket. Early indications point to another strong season.XS&P 500 companies are expected to report 8% earnings growth on a 4.6% gain in revenues, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S as of July 6. That's a big reversal from a 2.1% profit decline in Q2 2016 as the energy-led earnings slump extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. And it solidifies the comeback that has seen S&P 500 profit growth of 4.3%, 8% and 15.3% in the last three quarters.Apple (AAPL), which has returned to growth in the prior two quarters, should continue to show EPS and revenue gains when it reports on Aug. 1. That's despite many consumers awaiting the Apple iPhone 8 later this year. Due to its massive size, Apple has an outsized impact on overall S&P 500 earnings and especially the S&P 500 technology sector. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) should see fat profit gains.That 8% overall earnings target for the second quarter is down 2 percentage points from the start of April, but that's half the usual four-point cut typically seen.That is fueling optimism on Wall Street that Q1's momentum — which saw earnings growth hit its highest level since 2011 — will continue into future quarters.""There is a lot more confidence in what is expected for Q3 than at this time last year,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.One downside to the modest revisions: The markets may already be pricing in strong results. Investors have been taking profits in leading tech stocks over the past month.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the opportunity for big gains or big losses. You may want to adopt this earnings options strategy to capture any upside while limiting your losses.Beyond Q2, S&P 500 companies should grow earnings 8.6% and 13.1% in Q3 and Q4, according to Thomson Reuters. They are estimated to grow earnings 11.3% in 2017 as a whole and 11.7% in 2018 vs. 1.4% in 2016.Profits and revenues have been robust from the roughly 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results so far, including Nike (NKE), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). Of those 23 companies, 78% have beaten EPS estimates and 87% have topped revenue forecasts.In a typical quarter, 64% of companies overall beat earnings estimates and 59% beat revenue views.The energy, technology and financials sectors are expected to drive earnings growth in Q2 — a period over which the S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and set a new all-time closing of 2,453 on June 19.Oil and gas companies earnings should reverse higher after an outright loss a year earlier. But oil prices are down significantly from the start of 2017, which has hurt shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks.Financials and technology, the two largest S&P 500 sectors, are expected to moderate earnings growth from the near-20% Q1 pace. But growth should still be solid, with financials up 7.6% and technology 11.2%, according to Thomson Reuters.Banks continue to see a deceleration in loan growth and unfavorable moves in bond yields, Mian said.Several Wall Street giants have warned of weak trading revenue in Q2, continuing the lackluster trend in 2017. That's a key reason why JPMorgan and Citigroup are expected to show little-to-no profit growth, while regional banks such Comerica (CMA) should see big EPS gains.Still, bank stocks large and small have been leading in recent weeks, helped by higher bond yields and massive buyback and dividend plans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have moved past buy points to long-time highs, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and others are in buy zones.Technology is the only sector outside of energy that is expected to best the overall 8% S&P 500 gain. The sector also has gotten a boost from Adobe, Oracle and Micron Technology (MU), which smashed quarterly expectations in late June, Mian said. Expect strong growth for Alphabet and Facebook, he added.Health care, which has seen shares of health insurers and many biotechs soar in 2017, is estimated to grow earnings a tepid 2.3%. Other laggards are likely to include materials (4.3%), consumer staples (3.6%), industrials (2.4%), real estate (1.9%), telecom (1.1%) and consumer discretionary (0.9%).The utilities sector should post a 2.8% earnings decline. Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, only industrials has seen an upward estimate revision for Q2 since the start of April.Zacks, which tracks sectors differently, expects aerospace, construction and industrial products to shine, with earnings growth of 49%, 15.6% and 11.9% respectively.Multinationals such as Apple, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Facebook, are expected to see less drag from a strong dollar on their earnings.""The dollar was only 4% higher year over year in the second quarter on average, so we don't expect a major impact to earnings because of that,"" said Lindsey Bell, a CFRA investment strategist. The greenback's continued weakness since then should provide a tailwind to multinationals' Q3 earnings.Mian also expects multinationals to benefit from a notably improved overseas growth outlook.""A dividing line in the last earnings season was that more internationally oriented companies had a more positive view of business than those that are domestically oriented,"" he said. ""I expect that trend to continue.""Q2 earnings growth should top current analyst estimates, in keeping with historical trends. But matching Q1's blowout performance will be a tough order, Mian said.The first quarter saw double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle — and that is unlikely to be surpassed for the next few quarters, in Mian's view.RELATED:Q2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that North Korea launched an ICBM, calling it a ""new escalation"" that will brought before the United Nations Security Council.

China's Shanghai composite climbed 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.5%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE was flat, Germany's Dax was little changed and France's CAC-40 climbed 0.1%.The overnight action exacerbates the Jekyll-and-Hyde market split underway for the last few weeks.On Monday,  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and many other leading big-cap titans pushed the Nasdaq composite lower again after another failed attempt at retaking the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average powered to a record high and S&P 500 index edged higher, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) leading the Dow while Bank of America (BAC) cleared a buy point.As the classic tale of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" shows, a split personality is unstable. While there are leaders and laggards, the major averages generally follow the same path. So will Bank of America and JPMorgan carry the day, or does the market succumb to Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google and a tech-led correction?Apple was the first and most notable tech titan to undercut its 50-day moving average on June 10, following the sudden tech stock reversal on June 9. In recent days, Apple has been relatively stable, holding in a consolidation beneath its 50-day, but not heading below that area. But it certainly isn't showing leadership either.Facebook fell 1.9% on Monday, finally closing below its 50-day line after several tests. Amazon, which finished last week just pennies below the 50-day, initially rallied Monday but then reversed for a 1.5% loss, clearly separating from its support line. Netflix, the smallest of the FANG internet giants, continued to descend, sliding 2.2% to its lowest level since late April. Google parent Alphabet lost 1.1%, back to late April prices.Among other big techs, Microsoft (MSFT) retreated 1.1%, continuing to find 50-day resistance.A slew of chip and chip-equipment stocks have tumbled through their key support lines in recent days and weeks. Even the holdouts are running into trouble.Nvidia (NVDA) is still above its 50-day line, but is rapidly approaching that level after climax-like action from May 9-June 9. Micron Technology (MU), which reversed lower Friday despite seemingly strong earnings and guidance, fell sharply on Monday, undercutting its 50-day line.Workday (WDAY), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Paycom (PAYC) are top software firms that dropped below the 50-day on Monday.BofA, JPMorgan and other bank stocks have surged after they announced huge stock buybacks and dividend hikes last week following the completion of the second round of annual stress tests. A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields, partly due to a stronger eurozone economy that's lifting German bund yields and the euro, should be good for banks.JPMorgan rose 1.5% on Monday to 92.75, closing in on a 94.08 cup base. BofA advanced 1.7% to 24.68, closing above a 24.35 aggressive buy point.

128,MS,"XNow that the top U.S. banks have passed the first round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, investors will look to the second round next week, when banks' plans for returning capital to shareholders will be approved.Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck, in a research note this month, estimated that Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) alone have a combined $79 billion in extra capital. And she said the gross payout of dividends and buybacks from most of the banks being tested could rise to 95% of yearly earnings, up from 84% last year.The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, comes out Wednesday and evaluates banks' capital cushions as well as risk-management procedures and plans for dividends and buybacks.Before then, banks could hear back on the prospects of their capital-distribution plans. If those they don't pass muster, the banks can rework the plans to boost their odds of passing.For the banks that pass, investors can generally expect a flood of announcements from banks boosting their dividends and buybacks.But the Wall Street Journal pointed out that Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS) scored relatively low on the supplementary leverage ratio, potentially hurting their payouts. The ratio, which was reported for the first time in the first-round results released Thursday, measures total leverage, including off-balance sheet exposures.Shares of JPMorgan closed down 0.2% at 86.86 Friday, still near an 89.23 entry from a double-bottom base. Bank of America fell 0.5% to 22.82, near a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point. Morgan Stanley dropped 2.1% to 43.69, further below a 46.08 entry. Goldman Sachs finished 1.2% lower at 217.19, after dipping below its 50-day average Thursday. Citigroup eased 0.3%, still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Investors this year are hoping for higher payouts — in the form of dividends and stock buybacks — as banks bulk up on more capital and get used to the tests.Meanwhile, the first round of tests showed the nation's biggest banks have enough capital to continue lending in an economic meltdown. The results contain quantitative data on how the 34 banks being tested this year would hold up under different economic downturn conditions. None failed the test.This year, the most dire of the economic scenarios includes 10% unemployment, falling Treasury rates, a 25% drop in house prices and a 35% drop in commercial real estate prices through the first quarter of 2019. It also includes ""severe recessions"" in the eurozone, the U.K. and Japan, and a ""marked growth slowdown in developing Asia.""Under the worst-case scenario, the Fed estimates the 34 banks tested would suffer aggregate losses of $493 billion over nine quarters and requires banks to have a minimum 4.5% common equity tier 1 capital ratio — a gauge of a bank's high-quality capital in relation to risk-weighted assets. The stress test results released late Thursday showed the nation's top banks met that standard and then some.Ally Financial (ALLY) came the closest to the 4.5% minimum, with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%. KeyCorp (KEY) had 6.8% and SunTrust Banks (STI) 7.1%.U.S. banks began taking the stress tests in 2009 in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis a year earlier in which the financial industry cratered and swallowed a big part of the economy with it.RELATED:How Much Will JPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Goldman Pay Shareholders This Year?Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading Revenue

129,MS,"A canny move by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to invest in troubled banks after the 2008 financial crisis has paid off again. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) chairman will pocket $12 billion from an investment in Bank of America (BAC) six years ago, with this week's bank stress-test results set to deliver a giant windfall to his stock portfolio.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced Friday that it will exercise warrants in the bank allowing it to acquire 700 million common shares at $7.14 each. That transaction works out to about $5 billion, but is actually worth roughly $17.02 billion based on Bank of America's Friday intraday price of 24.37 — making for a profit of approximately $12 billion.The move came after Bank of America's decision Wednesday to raise its annual dividend by 60% to 12 cents a quarter. Earlier that same day, the Federal Reserve said that Bank of America and the other firms subject to the central bank's annual stress tests cleared the final round of those tests, paving the way for the dividend increase.Berkshire's move, which would make the company BofA's biggest shareholder, also delivers on expectations that Buffett raised in his annual letter to shareholders.""If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock — now 30 cents annually — should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common,"" Buffett said in the letter. 2021 is the deadline to execute the warrants.Buffett in March 2013 made roughly $3.1 billion off an investment in Goldman Sachs (GS) at the height of the financial crisis. His deal with the investment bank included both preferred shares and warrants, which are similar to options in that they give an investor the legal right to buy a stock at a specific price.Preferred shares, like common shares, represent an ownership stake in a company. However, preferred shares are seen as ""safer"" because shareholders get priority when it comes to dividends and bankruptcy, as their name would suggest. That usually comes at the cost of not having the same voting rights as common shareholders.Buffett's decision to exercise the warrants Friday was seen as a vote of confidence in Bank of America. Shares of Bank of America were roughly flat at 24.33 in late-morning trade on the stock market today. Bank of America's gains so far this week put shares closer to a 25.90 buy point from a first-stage flat base.Other money-center banks were mixed Friday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a Dow industrials component, added 0.3%, Wells Fargo (WFC) gave up 0.7% as it moves through a cup base, and Citigroup (C) was down 0.15%.Goldman Sachs, another Dow financial, shed 1.1%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 0.4%.The blue-chip Dow itself traded up 0.3% as Nike (NKE) outperformed on news of its Amazon (AMZN) deal.RELATED:Nike Spikes Into Buy Zone After Scoring With Earnings, AmazonJPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Wells Fargo Hike Payouts, OK Massive Buybacks

130,MS,"For decades, a subset of investors embraced socially responsible investing. That group grows larger by the day.As advisors field more inquiries about SRI (also called impact investing), they are offering more specialized guidance and knowledge. Some financial planners carve out a niche as experts in this area.When clients want to invest in companies that are aligned with their values, advisors often respond with enthusiasm. Even for those planners who lack a deep grounding in what's also known as environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, they can suggest an ever-expanding range of products.""About 10% to 20% of our clients raise SRI with us,"" said Patrick Stark, a certified financial planner in Newport Beach, Calif. ""We respond by saying, 'We have options for you.' There's no shortage of these types of funds.""As interest swells in SRI, dollars follow. Total U.S.-based assets under management that fall under the ESG umbrella hit $8.72 trillion in 2016, up 33% since 2014, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.When educating clients about SRI, Stark warns that the results might ""slightly underperform"" a portfolio that includes so-called sin stocks. These companies sell alcohol, tobacco, gambling and other products or services that some deem unethical or otherwise objectionable.Despite Stark's warning, about half his clients remain adamant about sticking to stocks that pass SRI screens. And he accommodates them, often by proposing SRI-oriented mutual funds from Vanguard or Dimensional Fund Advisors.""There have been lots of studies of SRI funds and most conclude SRI returns are slightly lower,"" Stark said. ""But the results are all over the map"" and some research indicates investors need not sacrifice performance when seeking a portfolio that reflects their values.While today's clients may express more interest in SRI, the concept is hardly new. One of the first SRI indexes debuted in 1990; now called the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index, it contains stocks of 400 companies with high environmental, social and governance ratings.Since 1990, the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index average annual return of 8.4% has exceeded the S&P 500 index return of 7.6%.The push for SRI has even started to carry over into bonds. In recent weeks, some portfolio managers who hold Venezuelan bonds are rethinking their investments as the country's government limits imports of food and medicine for its citizens while making debt payments.Investors' heightened awareness of these issues has led advisors to beef up their understanding of what constitutes SRI. Values-based investing means different things to different people.""There's no one definition of socially responsible investing,"" said John Burke, a certified financial planner in Iselin, N.J. He cites social investing pioneer Amy Domini's seven-point framework for identifying socially responsible investments: environment, human rights, consumer health and safety, local and national communities, diversity, harmful and addictive products and fossil fuel owners and producers.""When I ask clients to define what they mean by SRI, they usually reply with some of the seven areas that Amy Domini identified like tobacco and weapons manufacturers,"" Burke said. ""Then we exclude individual stocks in those areas.""Like Stark, Burke does not want to proselytize. Instead, he seeks to fulfill the client's wishes and build a solid relationship based on trust and responsiveness.""I don't impose my values on my clients,"" Burke said. ""It's not like I'm always bringing up (SRI).""Some clients express a particularly keen interest in aligning their investments with their values. They may prefer to construct their own screens with Burke's help.""For those who are more serious about it, we've created a portfolio of stocks and had the client review our portfolio,"" Burke said. ""They'll in turn screen what we've listed"" and perhaps tweak the selections.Customizing a portfolio under these circumstances can get tricky. Some screening criteria are straightforward, such as avoiding tobacco companies.""But other categories can get more difficult to define, such as a company's hiring practices and whether those practices meet certain standards,"" Burke said.The most engaged clients may harbor passionate views about what's acceptable and unacceptable. This can test an advisor's knowledge of the investment landscape, as funds focus on everything from companies with LGBT-friendly policies to those that appeal to Catholics, Muslims and Presbyterians.SRI's emergence as a mainstream strategy has even influenced the offerings of robo-advisors. Large financial services firms such as TIAA have rolled out robo-platforms that target millennials who prefer socially responsible investments, and other companies such as Morgan Stanley (MS) plan to launch similar vehicles in the coming months.RELATED: Master The Art Of Asking Clients Revealing QuestionsFinancial Advisors At Home: How They Teach Their Kids About Money Matters

131,MS,"X Stock futures were slightly higher Monday morning after a week in which a handful of big-cap techs, notably Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), continued to power ahead.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1% vs. fair value, off overnight highs. Nasdaq 100 futures were just above break-even.U.S. crude oil futures jumped 3% to $49.25 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia said in a joint press event in Beijing that they favor extending the OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts by nine months to the end of Q1 2018. OPEC and its allies meet May 25.Another big issue for Monday is whether the worldwide cyberattacks demanding ransoms will reignite. Cybersecurity stocks rallied again early Monday.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 index dipped last week, while the Nasdaq composite rose for a fourth straight week. Apple, the biggest component of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, rose 4.8% last week to record highs, and is up nearly 9% so far in May.Amazon rose 2.9% last week, hitting a new high Friday. Netflix advanced 2.7%, hitting record levels during the week. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), the other two members of the FANG internet giants rose fractionally near all-time bests.All five of these tech titans are up at least 20% so far this year, with Apple surging 35%.If the FANG+ stocks falter — or merely move sideways — will another broad sector step up to keep the overall market rally going?Bank stocks have largely been basing for the past few months, as the postelection rally stalls amid lower Treasury yields and concerns about whether President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts and other pro-growth agenda items.Citigroup (C) is in a flat base next to a failed breakout from a cup pattern. Citi rose 0.6% to 61.07 in Friday stock market trading. The current consolidation has a standard buy point of 62.63, 10 cents above the March 8 intraday peak. However, investors could view 60.89 as an aggressive entry. Citi nudged past that price several times in the past two weeks, but didn't close above it until Friday. Volume was 9% below average on Friday, which suggests lackluster buying by big institutions.IBD'S TAKE: From JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the small, community banks, the financial industry believes post-crisis regulation and capital requirements go too far. President Trump signaled he's open to breaking up banking giants, but here's an in-depth look at why Trump will bust up bank regulation, not the banks.Citi's relative strength line has moved sideways for the past few months, below early January peaks. It's better to see a stock's RS line rising to new high before a stock breaks out.Citi is faring better than many other banking giants. Bank of America (BAC) is just above its 50-day moving average. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Morgan Stanley (MS) are both just below their 50-day lines. Goldman Sachs (GS), another Dow component, and Wells Fargo (WFC) are near recent lows. Wells Fargo shares sold off late last week amid revelations that the number of fake accounts created by the bank's staff apparently was much higher than expected.In European trading, stocks were little changed in intraday action. British stocks edged higher while German and French indexes fell 0.2%.Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1% in Monday trading, while China's Shanghai composite rose 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.9%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed little changed.China released economic data showing slower-than-expected industrial production, retail sales and investment gains in April vs. a year earlier.RELATED:Check Out These 5 Software Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesSecurity Software Stocks Rally Amid 'WannaCry' Cyberattack Alibaba, Salesforce, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Applied Materials Lead Investing Action PlanNasdaq Rises For 4th Week; 3D Stocks Make Nice MovesHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

132,MS,"In many ways ObamaCare was a massive, trillion-dollar tax increase masquerading as a health reform plan.Certainly the extreme negative economic effects of these tax hikes have been underreported by the media. Republicans are right to fight for their total repeal, but the left has retaliated by saying that the GOP plan is a tax cut for the wealthy. That's the line from Warren Buffett, who says rich people will benefit.But ObamaCare's taxes hurt nearly everyone — with new tolls on business investment, drug and vaccine production, payrolls, medical devices, hiring, and union health insurance plans.Wait. We want more of all of these things don't we? Every one of the taxes was counterproductive.Take the tax on health insurers. The whole objective of ObamaCare was to increase the number of and affordability of health plans. So why tax them and make them more expensive — less ""affordable?""Medical devices and drugs obviously save lives and save the health care system money to boot by replacing more expensive medical procedures in the hospital. If we want to win the race for the cure for cancer, heart disease, MS, epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other terrible diseases, why ‎put more shackles on the companies that are developing these lifesavers? We want more pharmaceutical spending and more innovation, yet the liberals taxed it all.To improve health, throw out all of these taxes.Then there is the health of the economy. One major reason that Obama gave us the weakest recovery from a recession is that business investment fell dramatically.Larry Kudlow of CNBC discovered ‎that, during this recovery, business capital spending for plants, equipment and computers was one-third the rate it was from 1950-2000.There are many reasons for businesses turning so gun-shy — including the Obama regulatory assault — but one of them was Obama's 60% hike in capital gains and dividend taxes. The tax rate skyrocketed to 23.8% from 15%. These are taxes on the return to business investment, so no wonder we fell well below the trend line.Business startups also fell in this recovery. Why invest in a risky new business if the government is going to snatch up to 50% of the profits — through taxes on income and capital gains?The people who were hurt most by this weren't the investors themselves. It was the millions of working-class Americans who didn't get jobs and the millions more who didn't get a pay raise because businesses weren't started or expanded. ‎They are the victims of the invisible fist of ObamaCare.What about the myth that cutting the 3.8% investment surcharge on those who earn more than $250,000 will create a windfall for the very rich? No, if history is any guide, it's likely that the rich will pay more tax, not less, with the lowering of the rate.For example, ‎after the capital gains tax hike in 1986 from 20% to 28%, capital gains revenues fell from $44 billion a year to $27 billion a year by 1991. After Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax down to 20% again, capital gains revenues surged from $54 billion in 1996 to $99 billion in 1999. Lower rates, more revenues.Dan Clifton, an analyst at the investment advisory firm Strategis, finds that the 2003 Bush capital gains tax cut from 20% to 15% ""increased tax revenues by billions of dollars in the first three years."" He notes, ""the tax cut indisputably paid for itself,"" because investors bought and sold stock when the tax rate was lowered, thus creating more taxable income.Buffett says he doesn't ""need the tax cut,"" but he's welcome not to take it. He's right that millionaires and billionaires are doing ""just fine,"" but the repeal of the ObamaCare tax hikes is for the ‎rest of us.RELATED:Blame The Free Market, ComradeThe Next Big Lie About ObamaCareObamaCare Repeal Is A Jobs Program

133,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Standard Chartered this week became the latest big banks to announce a retreat from London in the wake of the U.K.'s plans to leave the European Union.Hundreds of JPMorgan workers in London, one of the world's biggest financial hubs, will move to Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg, Daniel Pinto, the bank's investment banking chief, said in an interview on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.""We are going to use the three banks we already have in Europe as the anchors for our operations,"" he said.""We will have to move hundreds of people in the short term to be ready for day one, when negotiations finish, and then we will look at the longer-term numbers,"" he added.The financial world has been concerned about how the U.K.'s departure from the EU, which could occur over the next two-or-so years after a vote to do so last summer, will affect how banks with operations in London do business with the rest of the bloc.Pinto said that JPMorgan had to assume the worst — that is, a U.K. that loses its so-called financial ""passporting"" agreements currently in place with other EU nations. Those agreements make it easier for banks in the U.K. to offer services in other EU countries.JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% to 87 in the stock market today, picking up slightly after a no-surprise Federal Reserve policy announcement. Shares are currently in a flat base with a 94.08 buy point, though they are trading below their 50-day line. Goldman Sachs (GS), another Dow component that is currently consolidating, gained 0.5%. Citigroup (C), also in a flat base, advanced 0.9%.Bank of America (BAC) gained 1%. That stock is in a flat base as well. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 0.3%.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said that up to 4,000 U.K. jobs could be affected in the wake of Brexit, but that the actual amount would depend on negotiations, Bloomberg noted.Negotiations could also be shaped by the outcome of France's runoff election on Sunday. Emmanuel Macron, the pro-EU candidate and favorite in that election, could take a harder stance against Britain.In JPMorgan's annual letter to shareholders, Dimon said the bank was preparing for a hard exit by the U.K.""While this does not entail moving many people in the next two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries,"" he said at the time.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks could be rangebound until the financial world gets more clarity on the Trump administration's plans to cut taxes and regulations. Using London as a springboard into Europe has made sense for U.S. banks. The technology and talent are there, and the language barrier is nonexistent. But analysts have been concerned the city's status as a financial center could erode as companies relocate bankers.The London-based Standard Chartered on Wednesday also said it wants to establish a division in Frankfurt to circumvent any new financial barriers that arise from the U.K.'s departure.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) could follow suit, while Deutsche Bank (DB) said 4,000 employees could be shifted from London to other parts of the EU, Bloomberg noted. The British bank Barclays (BCS) could also shift more of its weight to Dublin.RELATED:Goldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

134,MS,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) said Thursday it increased the price of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone to partially offset a 4% dip in global first-quarter sales — but shares fell as total revenue missed Wall Street's views.On the stock market today, Teva stock rose 2% to 32 after earlier falling as much as 3.7%. Shares are down for the year amid an antitrust probe into generics including Teva, Mylan (MYL) and Perrigo (PRGO).For the first quarter ended March 31, Teva reported adjusted income of $1.06 a share on $5.63 billion in sales. Profits topped by 3 cents, but declined 14% year over year. Sales missed the $5.68 billion view, but grew 17% vs. last year.Generic medicine sales of $3.1 billion grew 24% and comprised 54% of total sales, up from the 51% chunk it represented in the year-earlier period. Teva noted its acquisition of Actavis helped boost the segment in the quarter. Revenue from Teva's specialty drug unit declined 6% to $2 billion.Teva blamed lower sales of its central nervous system and respiratory drugs for the decrease in specialty medicines. To help offset that, Teva received a $75 million payment from a Takeda subsidiary which bought the royalties and rights to multiple myeloma drug Ninlaro.Copaxone, though, saw 4% fewer sales in the quarter. In the U.S., revenue for the multiple sclerosis drug fell 5% to $782 million ""partially offset by a price increase of 7.9% for both Copaxone products in January 2017,"" Teva said. Teva sells 20-milligram and 40-milligram doses of Copaxone.IBD'S TAKE: Generic drug stocks toppled last week after federal officials searched Perrigo's offices as part of a widespread price-fixing investigation. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper look at the companies facing Department of Justice scrutiny.Outside the U.S., Copaxone revenue grew 2% to $188 million, but Teva faces looming Copaxone competition. In February, a Delaware court ruled invalid four key patents protecting the drug, siding with Mylan. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) are working on Copaxone copies.Respiratory products also toppled 17% in the first quarter, bringing in $304 million in revenue. Sales from asthma inhalers ProAir and Qvar declined 30% and 27%, respectively. Teva noted that wholesaler and retailer inventory reductions, as well as net pricing effects, played into the dips.Teva also said Michael McClellan will serve as interim chief financial officer, effective July 1, following the planned departure of Eyal Desheh. Before joining Teva, McClellan had a 20-year-plus career at Sanofi (SNY).RELATED:Mylan Q1 Revenue Falls Short Of Views As EpiPen Sales DeclineTeva Downgraded On Lost MS Drug Patents, DOJ Probe

135,MS,"Dear Ms. Fonda:Before you travel to Detroit this weekend to campaign for a $12 minimum wage, I suggest you read this letter.I'm sure you mean well. But are you familiar with the voluminous number of peer-reviewed studies that conclude minimum-wage laws damaged the very people that many of the Hollywood left say they care about — blacks?Respected economist David Neumark examined all of the major academic minimum-wage studies from the previous 20 years, more than 100 studies in all. Eighty-five percent of the studies found that minimum-wage laws destroy jobs, causing workers to lose jobs and/or hours or causing businesses to shut down. ""Minimum-wage laws,"" said Neumark, have ""a negative employment effect on low-skilled workers.""Believe it or not, before minimum-wage laws took effect, a black teenager was actually more likely to have a job than a white teen. I repeat — before the impact of federal minimum-wage laws, the first of which was in 1938, a black teen was more likely to be employed than a white teen. What happened?Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman calls the minimum-wage law ""one of the most, if not the most, anti-black laws on the statute books."" Friedman said: ""The do-gooders believe that by passing a law saying that nobody shall get less than $2 an hour or $2.50 an hour, or whatever the minimum wage is, you are helping poor people who need the money. You are doing nothing of the kind. What you are doing is to assure that people whose skills are not sufficient to justify that kind of a wage will be unemployed. ...""The minimum wage law is most properly described as a law saying employers must discriminate against people who have low skills. That's what the law says. The law says here's a man who ... has a skill which would justify a wage rate of $1.50, $2.00 an hour. You can't, you may not employ him. It's illegal. Because if you employ him you have to pay him $2.50. Well, what's the result? To employ him at $2.50 is to engage in charity. Now there's nothing wrong with charity. But most employers are not in a position where they can engage in that kind of charity. Thus the consequences of minimum-wage rates have been almost wholly bad, to increase unemployment and to increase poverty. Moreover, the effects have been concentrated on the groups that the do-gooders would most like to help. The people who have been hurt most by minimum-wage laws are the blacks.""Contrary to popular belief, most people on minimum wages are not men with families, but teenagers and part-time workers, and a disproportionately high percentage of them are young black and brown workers.The Black Entertainment Television website, in 2011, published an article titled ""Black Teens are Fired When the Minimum Wage Rises"": ""Economists William Even from Miami University and David Macpherson from Trinity University report that when a state, or the federal government, increases the minimum wage, black teens are more likely to be laid off. ... The report focused on 16- to 24-year-old males without a high school diploma and found that for each 10% increase in the federal or state minimum wage employment for young black males decreased 6.5%. By contrast, after the same wage boost, employment for white and Hispanic males fell respectively just 2.5% and 1.2%.""The real hit for black teens occurred, however, in the 21 states that had the federal minimum wage increase in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The findings reveal that while 13,200 black young adults lost their jobs as a direct result of the recession nearly 40% more, a total of 18,500, were fired because of the rise in the federal minimum wage.""A new study on the minimum wage just came in. ""Survival of the Fittest: The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Firm Exit"" is by two researchers, one with Mathematica Policy Research and the other with Harvard Business School. It focused on whether a minimum-wage increase also increased the likelihood of a restaurant shutting down as a result of the increased cost of labor. The researchers concluded that ""a $1 increase in the minimum wage leads to approximately a 4% to 10% increase in the likelihood of exit."" Not good.Finally, even California Gov. Jerry Brown, who signed a $15 minimum-wage bill last year, conceded, ""Economically, minimum wages may not make sense. But morally, and socially and politically, they make every sense because it binds the community together."" Astonishing. Tell that to somebody who lost a job or failed to get one because of the minimum wage.Have fun in Detroit, Ms. Fonda. Maybe instead of a speech, take in a Tigers game. You'll do a lot less damage.Sincerely,Larry Elder

137,MS,"U.S. stock indexes followed France's CAC-40 to bold gains Monday morning.The Nasdaq jumped 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1% each. Small caps trailed as the Russell 2000 slipped 0.3%. Volume was unclear in the early going.The Nasdaq has been encountering resistance at 5911-5936 since early March. A break through that area would probably signal a removal of pressure. The U.S. stock market has worn the under-pressure label for 23 sessions. If it stays under pressure today, that would mark the most days under pressure in more than nine years.If France lifts the U.S. market out of its doldrums, that would be a bit of a surprise. France seldom plays a financial role beyond its borders. But the CAC-40 gained more than 4% on first-round elections results that suggested that moderation would win out. The U.S. stock market apparently decided that France was now one less worry on the international plate.Thirteen industry groups led the way in the U.S. market. The big movers included banks, airlines, specialty steel and shippers. On the downside, gold miners dropped the most. Of IBD's 197 industry groups, only a half dozen or so were in the red.

138,MS,"Generic drug stocks crashed Wednesday on news the Department of Justice has conducted a search at Perrigo's (PRGO) offices related to a widespread price-fixing investigation that is also looking at Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).In early trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell a collective 4.5% to a two-week low. Lannett Company (LCI) and Perrigo stocks lost the most, down 18.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Lannett missed third-quarter earnings estimates late Tuesday.Perrigo declined to comment beyond a press release, which confirmed authorities executed the search warrants at Perrigo's corporate offices.""As has been previously disclosed by a number of companies, the (Justice Department's) antitrust division has been looking at industrywide pricing practices,"" Perrigo's release said. ""The company is taking this investigation seriously and is cooperating with the appropriate authorities.""The investigation centers on potential price collusion among a dozen companies. It's illegal for companies to agree on a set price or corporate discounts. In Perrigo's case, the Justice Department is looking at the price of its skin drugs, Bloomberg reported.Other drugmakers under investigation are Allergan (AGN), Impax Laboratories (IMPX), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP), a subsidiary of Par Pharmaceutical.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with pharma news by visiting IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Mylan told Investor's Business Daily last year it received a subpoena regarding doxycycline, an antibiotic, but hadn't been asked for information on the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure drug.

139,MS,"U.S. and European bank stocks spiked Monday as the French presidential election eased fears, triggering broad stock market gains, higher bond yields and increased odds for a Federal Reserve rate hike.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) closed 3.5% higher on the stock market today. Citigroup (C), which has a large base of operations internationally, advanced 3%. Bank of America (BAC) popped 4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) rallied 2.9%. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all remained below their 50-day moving average.Among European banks, the gains were far more pronounced. Deutsche Bank (DB), which has been hurt by litigation and still-open wounds in Europe's own economy, surged 11%. Barclays (BCS) jumped 5.9%.France's CAC index jumped 4.1% to finish at the highest level in nine years, while the Dow industrials rose 1% and the Nasdaq composite hit an all-time high.The lift came after the first round of French elections put Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate, narrowly ahead of Marine Le Pen, who has campaigned on a hard-right, anti-EU platform with nationalistic, anti-immigrant strains similar to those that helped carry President Trump to victory in the U.S.Macron and Le Pen now advance to a May 7 runoff. Macron, who has never been elected but is pushing a pro-reform agenda, is heavily favored. However, so was Hillary Clinton in the U.S., and many did not expect the United Kingdom to vote in favor of leaving the EU last year. But Macron appears to have a lead of more than 20 points vs. Le Pen.The outcome, Wall Street seems to think, could have been worse.A runoff between Le Pen and Jean-Luc Melenchon — a far-left candidate who also wanted to shake up France's relationship with the EU and tax the wealthy at 100% — would have triggered concerns about France's future in the euro and European Union even as the U.K. begins what could be an ugly divorce from the bloc.Meanwhile, the odds for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve by the June meeting jumped to 66% on Monday, up from 53% on Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield, a longer-term measure of inflation expectations, rose 5 basis points to 2.29% Monday morning.The European Central Bank may feel more comfortable about winding down its quantitative easing program earlier if Macron wins the French presidency.Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 4.2%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.2%.

140,MS,"Generics will chip away at Sanofi's (SNY) multiple sclerosis drug by 2021, but until then the treatment will help offset erosion for the company in the diabetes market, an analyst said Tuesday as he upgraded Sanofi stock.JPMorgan analyst Richard Vosser upgraded Sanofi stock to neutral from a buy rating. In early trading on the stock market today, Sanofi stock was up 1.3% to close at 45.17. Shares have traded well above their 50-day moving average since mid-February.""Diabetes erosion is largely reflected in (the) consensus and is offset by growth in the multiple sclerosis franchise,"" he wrote in a report. But Sanofi's multiple sclerosis drug, Aubagio, is likely to have competition in 2021.Vosser sees a silver lining in Sanofi and Regeneron's (REGN) eczema drug, Dupixent. He sees roughly $3.2 billion in peak sales, starting with $98.5 million in 2017 and growing to $1.1 billion in 2020. But even those projections are 30% and 44%, respectively, below the consensus.IBD'S TAKE: Sanofi could be considering a bid on another French drugmaker. For details on who and how much, head to IBD's Technology page.Regeneron and Sanofi are also working against No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) to sell Praluent, a drug designed to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The trio are wrapped in a patent battle as Sanofi and Regeneron appeal a judge's decision to pull Praluent from the shelves.For 2018 and 2020, Vosser models $505 million and $1.27 billion for Praluent.

Sales for $125,000 drug Spinraza, the only medication approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy, reached $47 million in its first quarter.Payers are pushing back at the $750,000 first-year treatment cost. Though Spinraza is approved for three types of spinal muscular atrophy, most payers are only reimbursing costs for patients with the most severe form.Stock Action: Biogen stock rose 3.6% to close at 286.89 on the stock market today.Tysabri drug sales rose 15% worldwide, but most of Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise showed declines. Its MS drugs will soon see competition from Roche (RHHBY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved in late March for both primary-progressive and relapsing-remitting forms of MS.Drugs from Biogen, AbbVie (ABBV), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY) are only approved for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Ocrevus is entering the nascent primary-progressive MS market where it is the only drug approved.Ocrevus is likely to gouge share from rivals in the second quarter, analysts have said.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen was considered a takeover last year with a strong multiple sclerosis franchise, the potential for Spinraza still in the air and a six-month span without a chief executive. Today, Biogen looks much different. Head to IBD's Technology page for a look at whether Biogen is still a strong acquisition candidate.RELATED:Street Watches To See If $125,000 Drug Boosts Biogen's Results

146,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS) posted Wall Street's biggest percentage increase in bond-trading revenue as a turnaround in that business accelerated.Fixed-income revenue almost doubled to $1.71 billion, the New York-based company said Wednesday in a statement, topping the $1.56 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equities-trading revenue declined 1.9% to $2.02 billion, compared with the $1.92 billion estimate. Morgan Stanley is Wall Street's leading stock-trading shop by revenue.""We reported one of our strongest quarters in recent years,"" Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in the statement. ""All our businesses performed well in improved market conditions. We are confident in our business model and the opportunities ahead, while recognizing that the environment remains uncertain.""The results marked the fourth straight quarter Morgan Stanley posted bond-trading revenue above $1 billion after Gorman said the business could produce at least $4 billion annually. The fixed-income division -- crucial to the CEO's plan to improve companywide returns -- was overhauled in late 2015 after revenue plunged to $550 million in that year's final quarter. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25% of the division's staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business.The results followed a surprise miss by Goldman Sachs (GS) on Tuesday, when that firm said revenue from fixed-income trading suffered from weaker demand in commodities, currencies and credit. Goldman's $1.69 billion in revenue missed analysts' $2.03 billion estimate. Bank of America (BAC), by contrast, posted stronger trading revenue that helped fuel a 40% surge in first-quarter profit. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) last week also reported higher fixed-income trading revenue.Morgan Stanley's net income surged 70% to $1.93 billion, or $1 a share, from $1.13 billion, or 55 cents, a year earlier, the company said in the statement. Profit surpassed the 90-cent average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Return on equity, a gauge of profitability, rose to 10.7% from 8.7% in the previous quarter and 6.2% a year earlier. Analysts had expected 9.75%, and Gorman has targeted 9%-11% for 2017.Morgan Stanley's companywide revenue rose 25% to $9.75 billion, compared with the $9.29 billion average estimate of analysts. Non-interest expenses climbed 15% to $6.94 billion, above the $6.69 billion estimate as revenue climbed faster than analysts predicted. The firm said at the start of 2016 it would trim $1 billion in annual expenses by this year.Compensation, the firm's biggest expense, increased 21% to $4.47 billion, compared with the $4.2 billion estimate.

148,MS,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) will put four programs to treat Parkinson's, migraines and multiple sclerosis on the back burner to deal with the potential loss of funding wrought by the planned expiration of exclusive sales rights for its multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra in July 2018, CEO Ron Cohen said.Though Acorda is appealing the invalidation of four patents protecting Ampyra, the midcap biotech is planning to trim $50 million per year from its expenses. Cohen says the company invests 40% of its revenue into research and development.In the meantime, Acorda will focus on two Parkinson's drugs — the furthest along in its pipeline of six. Inbrija, also known as CVT-301, is an inhaled version of L-DOPA, a key treatment for Parkinson's. Tozadenant can be added to treatment regimens to extend the amount of time users have muscle control.Still, Cohen told Investor's Business Daily, those two drugs will do ""very little"" to curb the loss of Ampyra exclusivity. In 2016, Ampyra brought in $493 million in sales. Acorda is planning to file an application with the FDA for Inbrija by the end of June and expects a 10-month review.""Ampyra is an over $500 million net revenue stream now and even Inbrija is approved in 2018 and we launch it, it's not going to be anywhere close to $500 million in the first year,"" he said. ""It takes time in a launch to ramp up as more and more patients are aware of it and doctors prescribe it.""Data on Inbrija have been strong, Cohen said. Inhaling L-DOPA, as opposed to taking a pill, is a much faster method of delivery, he said. In clinical trials, Inbrija began working as early as 10 minutes relative to the placebo. It hasn't been shown to cause any damage to the lungs.Swallowing pills tends to be a slower method of delivery because it requires digestion. Inhaled drugs have fewer barriers to pass to begin working, he said. In another study, patients on L-DOPA were found to still have unabsorbed pills in their stomachs two hours after taking them.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda isn't the only company suffering troubles with multiple sclerosis drugs. Biogen's (BIIB) MS franchise is facing competition from Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Biogen's takeover prospects are now close to nil.But it's a balancing act because too many drugs can cause uncontrolled movements called dyskinesia.""They either have too little or they have too much,"" he said. ""And because trying to take more pills can screw up their whole regimen, that's also not a good solution.""Acorda is also working on tozadenant, which Cohen called the first new mechanism for Parkinson's in more than 20 years. Patients on multiple Parkinson's regimens can add tozadenant to increase the amount of time they have muscle control. In trials, the drug extended ""on periods"" by an hour.But, to focus on Inbreja and tozadenant, drugs in Parkinson's, migraine and multiple sclerosis will have to take a back seat, be partnered on or licensed out, Cohen said. A fourth drug, a recently acquired anti-inflammatory, was always planned to be licensed as it's not in Acorda's neurological sweet spot.Eventually, Cohen says, he'd like to restart those programs. The migraine and heart failure drugs, though, were already slated for the back burner because of, respectively, side effects in the liver and lungs.""In essence, this is a partial, tactical retreat so we can come back with success and ramp up our investments in the earlier-stage products,"" he said. ""It may be along the way we find it necessary to partner those programs with some other companies.""RELATED:Acorda Trims 20% Of Workforce But Looming Cuts Could Be DeeperAcorda, Forward, Biogen Fall On Multiple Sclerosis Drug FightAcorda, Forward Stocks Plunge On Multiple Sclerosis Court Rulings

151,MS,"XU.S. stock indexes were mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average down the most and small caps up the most.The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6%, as IBM's (IBM) 5% loss pulled down the Dow. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.3%.Volume was up, according to preliminary data. Turnover was about 10% faster on the Nasdaq and about 1% faster on the NYSE. Trade has been mostly below average in recent weeks.Blue chips were mostly down, even apart from IBM, which is now 11% off its high. The Dow industrial average component with the best gain was Intel (INTC), up moderately in soft trade. Intel is consolidating mostly under its 10-week moving average line, which is a negative. Intel is 6% off its high.The pressure the uptrend is encountering has hit some stocks hard. The selling has been especially tough for three of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) stocks. The S&P 500 has slipped 2% off its high. But some of the concentrated Berkshire holdings have lost much more: Wells Fargo (WFC) is 13% off its high. IBM is 11%  off its high. American Express (AXP) is 7% off its high.Those three stocks alone account for about 34% of Berkshire Hathaway's assets.The so-called Trump trade also has struggled. Cement stocks and money centers have pulled about 11% and 9% respectively off their highs.Yet, one money-center stock was doing well initially Wednesday. Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 4.2% in strong volume but then reversed to trim the gain to 2%. The company beat the Street's estimate on earnings. Analysts expected earnings to rise 60% to 88 cents a share vs. the year-ago quarter. But results showed an 82% earnings pop to $1 a share.Money centers that have reported have generally had good quarters. Of the 11 stocks trading above 15 and that have reported Q1 results, 10 topped the Street's consensus estimate and only one missed. But the reaction to the beats has been subdued.The market doesn't appear to be in a generous mood.The S&P 500 lost its March 14 distribution day because of time.

The narrow trade suggested that funds were unwilling to panic and sell indiscriminately.The Nasdaq trimmed 0.1%, while the S&P 500 retreated 0.3%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average sank 0.5%, hurt by a 5% drop in Goldman Sachs (GS). Volume in the stock market was higher on both major exchanges.Megacap Goldman reported adjusted quarterly earnings that grew 92% vs. the year-ago quarter but still came in 3% below views, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. Revenue also missed.The Goldman Sachs miss set the direction for the day but not the tone. For example, banks in other segments weren't suffering nearly as much. Superregional bank KeyCorp (KEY) fell 0.7% in soft volume. Regional play Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) slipped 1% in average trade. Money-center Morgan Stanley (MS) was unchanged. Morgan Stanley will report results before Wednesday's open.On a day like Tuesday, it's good to ask what was working. Here are four stocks that looked good Tuesday:Stratasys (SSYS), a 3D printer play, jumped nearly 12% as it cleared a shallow cup base within a larger consolidation. Piper Jaffray upgraded the stock from neutral to overweight. The company has endured a five-quarter decline in revenue on a year-ago basis. But Q4 results showed a 1% gain in revenue, breaking the losing streak.Churchill Downs (CHDN), the race track company that hosts the Kentucky Derby, gapped up almost 5% in heavy volume as it retook a 156.70 buy point. The stock is on the thinly traded side, moving about $9 million in daily dollar volume.The homebuilder group rose for the fifth time in the past six sessions, shrugging off slack housing start data, but only Colorado-based MDC Holdings (MDC) rose in strong volume.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) gapped up almost 5% as the stock climbed the right side of a consolidation. Earnings declined 5% in 2016 and aren't expected to turn positive for the year until 2018.RELATED:What To Expect When IBM ReportsThe Latest Nuts-And-Bolts Warning For Industrials

153,MS,"XGoldman Sachs (GS) fell short of Q1 forecasts Tuesday, blaming weak trading revenue on political uncertainty and low volatility, while Bank of America (BAC) reported better-than-expected earnings, led by strong trading and net interest income.Estimates: Earnings per share of $5.31, nearly double that of a year ago, when results from some banks were driven lower by the commodities crash and a slowing economy in China. Revenue is seen jumping 33% to $8.445 billion.Results: EPS of $5.15 on revenue of $8.03 billion. Revenues from bond, currency and commodities trading was little changed at $1.69 billion. Equities trading fell 6% to $1.67 billion. Investment bank revenue grew 16% to $1.7 billion. Investment management revenue rose 12% to $1.5 billion.""The operating environment was mixed, with client activity challenged in certain market-making businesses and a more attractive backdrop for underwriting in our investment banking franchise,"" said CEO Lloyd Blankfein in a statement. ""As the economy improves, we are well-positioned to not only meet our clients' diverse needs, but also to generate operating leverage for our shareholders.""Dividend: Quarterly payout was raised 15% to 75 cents a share.Stock: Goldman fell 4.7% to 215.59 on the stock market today, tumbling to its worst level since Nov. 30. Goldman Sachs was a major drag on the Dow Jones industrial average, and sent financial stocks lower.Fellow investment banker Morgan Stanley (MS), which reports Wednesday, dropped 0.7%.Estimates: A 67% jump in EPS to 35 cents, as revenue rises 10% to $21.611 billion.Results: EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $22.2 billion. Fixed-income trading swelled to $2.9 billion, above views. Net interest income grew 5% to $11.1 billion, in line with some views.Stock: Shares rose and fell, closing off 0.4% at 22.71.Bank of America, analysts have said, is more sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates than its peers, given its large amount of business it does here. The bank's fourth-quarter earnings were helped along by cost discipline and fewer losses on bad loans, a recent Edward Jones research note said.The earnings from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America follow those last week from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Investors have become more anxious that bank stocks' postelection run might not reflect the reality on the ground. Interest rates are rising, but doubts have grown over how fast the Trump administration might be able to carry out its more bank-friendly economic agenda.Shares of big banks have fallen since March as those expectations cool. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said last week that banks could stay within the range they're in now until details on tax policy become more concrete.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon urged patience.""You all should expect, as a given, that when you have a new president, and they get going, that the nine months after the 100 days is gonna be a sausage-making period,"" Dimon told analysts on the bank's first-quarter earnings call. ""There will be ups and downs, wins and losses, stuff like that.""JPMorgan and Citigroup beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, while Wells Fargo's EPS was above views. Trading results were strong for JPMorgan and Citigroup, helped in part by the outlook on interest rates.But JPMorgan's consumer and industrial loan growth was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter. Management said some of the slowdown might be due to past big acquisitions and because companies have other options, such as bonds, for financing.Citigroup also tempered its expectations for loan growth. And Wells Fargo saw auto-loan originations drop due to stricter underwriting standards, while home-loan originations also fell.RELATED:JPMorgan CEO Signals Patience As Trump's Growth Agenda Stalls

The small cap Russell 2000 trailed with a 0.5% pop. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply lower on both major exchanges. Two of the biggest gainers among secondary indexes were the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, up 1.1%, and the Philadelphia semiconductor index, up 0.9%.Among the big, money-center stocks, Wells Fargo (WFC) surged more than 2% as it bounced off its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) added 1.3%, on track to end a five-session losing streak. Morgan Stanley will report first quarter results Wednesday.Morgan Stanley gets a respectable 90 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup. Homebuilder stocks, which have been rising in the industry group ranks, did well Monday. D.R.

"
157,MS,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

159,MS,"Biotech investors will likely be keyed in on the launches of Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza and Regeneron's (REGN) Dupixent as first-quarter results roll around, an analyst said Wednesday in a sector preview.IBD's 424-company biotech industry group is ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 42 just 13 weeks ago. But the first quarter will be ""choppy"" amid inventory and seasonality challenges, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Wednesday.""Our analysis suggests that Q1 is not going to be a breakout or particularly impressive quarter for the large-cap names in our coverage universe, but neither is it going to be the disaster that the slowing results in Q4 might suggest,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Given the flux in shipping days and inventory levels, investors are likely to pay most attention to key launches already underway or anticipated for 2017.Biogen's spinal muscular atrophy drug with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is likely to be scrutinized amid recent payer pushback. Meanwhile, investors will be looking for commentary on how Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus, might hurt Biogen's MS franchise. Celgene (CELG) is also working on an MS drug, ozanimod.Expectations are still high for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent, an eczema injection that launched at the end of the first quarter.""Initial feedback from the company and physicians after a month of commercialization will be critical to assess the launch sales trend, especially any anecdotes about the accessibility for patients after the price announcement,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences is suffering from a slowing hepatitis C drug franchise. Could it buy itself out of the decline? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a better look at what Gilead may have its sights on acquiring.Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron are also likely to get questions on reimbursement changes for their medicines that lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Amgen showed in a recent study that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk for heart attacks and strokes, and the Street is hoping that will push payers to reimburse for the drugs.In upcoming filings, investors will look for Amgen commentary on migraine drug erenumab and romosozumab, a drug to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is working on immunosuppressant Soliris in a neuromuscular disease. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is testing its tezacaftor in cystic fibrosis.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is likely to comment on its HIV drug, bictegravir.

160,MS,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR), Forward Pharma (FWP) and Biogen (BIIB) stocks continued to feel the fallout Monday of several FDA and district court decisions regarding multiple sclerosis drugs Tecfidera and Ampyra.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acorda stock plunged 12.4% to 18.40. The stock dive followed a judge's decision Friday to toss out four of five patents covering MS drug Ampyra.Alkermes (ALKS), which manufactures Ampyra for Acorda and gets an 18% royalty on global sales, saw shares topple 1.9% to close at 57.42 in response. Analysts are a bit more bullish on Alkermes stock, though, noting that the drug Vivitrol, a treatment for opioid dependence, is ""underappreciated.""Biogen stock was down a fraction to 272.69, though it won Friday in an interference case vs. Forward. Biogen is likely to feel competitive pressure from Roche (RHHBY), which won FDA approval for its drug Ocrevus in two types of MS.Forward stock skidded by 8.3% to 19.73 Monday. Shares touched an 11-week low and remained well below their 50-day moving average for the seventh consecutive day.The likelihood of Acorda winning an appeal is slim, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said. Timing for the appeal is about 12 to 18 months, meaning a decision could come around the time the remaining patent on Ampyra is set to expire.Two generic versions of Ampyra have already received approval, with six others grabbing tentative approval, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients. Now, Acorda is prepping to cut spending.Analysts expect Acorda to turn to Parkinson's as its next big sector. Acorda has a pair of drugs, known as CVT-301 and tozadenant, that are now its first and second priorities, Matteis said. Acorda plans to file for approval of CVT-301 by the end of the second quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen spinoff, Bioverativ, says it's not a typical biotech startup. Why? Head to The New America for the breakdown.""The good thing for investors: Approval of CVT-301, after clean long-term safety data, now looks fairly de-risked in our view,"" Matteis said. He expects approval in 2018 and sees tozadenant coming out with strong topline Phase 3 data in the first quarter of 2018.CVT-301 and tozadenant are expected to have an overlapping prescriber base.Trbovich downgraded Acorda stock to neutral from a buy rating. He has a price target of 19 on the stock. Matteis kept his market-perform rating on Acorda stock and an outperform rating on Alkermes stock.Biogen may have won its case against Forward, but it looks likely to struggle against Roche and Celgene (CELG), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. Biogen gets a royalty on sales of Roche's Ocrevus, but Ocrevus will probably swipe some share from Biogen's Tecfidera.Tecfidera accounted for 76% of Biogen's sales in 2016, including half of all MS drug sales, and is expected to bring in 78% of total sales in 2017. But Tecfidera is only approved to treat relapsing-remitting MS. Ocrevus is approved in relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms.""While Biogen stands to gain from their royalties on Ocrevus, particularly from incremental revenue in (primary progressive MS), it also stands to lose revenue and profits in (relapsing-remitting MS) from the cannibalization of its existing products,"" Porges wrote in a report.The primary progressive MS market is small, about 10,000 treated patients vs. 300,000 in the relapsing-remitting MS market. Biogen has a leading 40% share of the relapsing-remitting market.""Our scenario suggests that the (primary progressive MS) market is too small and Biogen's royalty too low, to offset the profit erosion that Ocrevus will cause to Biogen's existing brands in the (relapsing-remitting MS) market,"" Porges said.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on its own MS drug, ozanimod. The drug is currently in Phase 3 testing.Investment bank Jefferies kept its hold rating on Biogen stock, but downgraded Forward stock to a hold rating from buy. Forward had been slated to receive royalties on Tecfidera sales in the U.S., but that ""hinged on a positive outcome in the interference (case).""RELATED:Acorda, Forward Stocks Plunge On Multiple Sclerosis Court RulingsRoche Multiple Sclerosis Drug OK Bittersweet For Beleaguered Biogen

But maybe not as decent as once expected as the postelection ""animal spirits"" that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average higher become tamer.The Fed's actual or planned rate hikes could help banks' net interest margins — the difference between the interest banks make on loans and what they pay to depositors — as those extra costs get passed onto consumers who need credit. Fixed-income trading will also likely be solid.But the GOP's botched attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act has thrown the timing for the administration's other policy goals, like tax cuts and the slashing-away of regulations, up in the air. President Trump on Tuesday said that he may work to end Dodd-Frank rules, but the announcement did nothing for bank stocks.JPMorgan shares dipped 0.2% on the stock market today after seeping through the bottom of a flat base intraday. Citigroup lost 0.4%, and Wells Fargo fell 0.7%. Bank of America (BAC), Dow stock Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which report next week, were down less than 1%.The banks' earnings will also come as expectations grow a little more conservative for trading revenue overall and loan growth. Red flags are flying in the auto loan sector as auto sales peter out, and March jobs figures also came in far below estimates.""Commercial borrowers still need clarity from Washington on employee healthcare costs, regulation and tax reform,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note on Monday. ""So we think many commercial borrowers are on hold until they can get more certainty on these topics.""Wall Street expects JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings per share to climb 13% to $1.52, with revenue rising 3% to $24.876 billion.As KBW noted Monday, JPMorgan at its investor day said it expected only a modest bump in trading results. The investment firm said there could be ""some noise in the quarter"" surrounding credit conditions due to delays in tax refunds. But it said the credit environment overall was likely ""benign"" and that residential mortgage trends were likely to remain solid.Investors will also be seeking any color from CEO Jamie Dimon on the economic and political climate in the U.S. and abroad. While U.S. banks have capitalized on a retreat from their European counterparts, the U.K.'s move to formally trigger an exit from the European Union could also create upheaval for the financial world.In JPMorgan's annual report, released last week, the bank said it was preparing for a hard exit from the U.K. The company also said it suspected there would ""constant pressure"" from the European Union ""not to 'outsource' services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabilities into EU subsidiaries.""The bank in that report also noted the rising sentiment against globalism. But it said that the U.S. trade agreement with Mexico helped guard the nation against populist anger. And it said ""there is no inevitable or compelling reason that China and America have to clash,"" despite the trade issues between the two nations.The bank also remained optimistic about the U.S., but said ""it is clear that something is wrong — and it's holding us back.""Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's EPS to dip 2% to 97 cents, with revenue up 0.5% to $22.309 billion.Wells' results arrive on the heels of a six-month investigation by an oversight committee into the high-pressure sales practices that led to last year's fake-account debacle, in which the bank was accused of creating unauthorized accounts in consumers' names.The bank has settled claims over the matter and ended sales goals in its retail banking division — that is, the division that offers loans and credit cards to people. But it has struggled to regain consumer trust. Openings of consumer checking accounts fell 43% in February.The committee's findings, released Monday, found flaws in the bank's decentralized structure, which it said gave too much independence to leadership that was unwilling to address the problem and foisted blame elsewhere.""It was common to blame employees who violated Wells Fargo's rules without analyzing what caused or motivated them to do so,"" the report said. ""Effect was confused with cause.""The bank also announced that it would claw back an additional $75 million total from John Stumpf, the bank's former CEO who stepped down last year, and Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells' community banks.But KBW said the report unearthed nothing new, a positive for the bank, so the scandal could be less of a focus during the earnings call than in months past. The firm also said that Wells' margins could be better than its peers' average.Analysts expect Citigroup, which is more internationally exposed than its rivals, to get a 12% boost in EPS to $1.23. Revenue is expected to creep up 1% to $17.763 billion. Some in the analyst community have expressed concerns about Citi's potential vulnerability to growing protectionism.""We believe Citi's emerging market exposure is manageable at this point because we fall in the camp that global reflation will occur and emerging markets risks will not emerge near term,"" KBW said in its report last week.""In fact,"" KBW said, ""should we see a meaningful pickup in global growth, then emerging market growth could accelerate and that would be a positive for Citi's revenues that are not fully reflected in our estimates.""RELATED:Fed Hikes Interest Rates But Doesn't Signal Faster Tightening PaceBanks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

162,MS,"Roche's (RHHBY) Ocrevus will be a ""game changer"" in multiple sclerosis and looks likely to chip away at 3%-4% of Biogen's (BIIB) nearly $9 billion franchise, an analyst said Friday.Physicians treating north of 16,000 multiple sclerosis patients say Ocrevus' launch will dramatically change the MS landscape, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Though Biogen gets a royalty on sales of Ocrevus, sales of Biogen's Tecfidera and Tysabri — along with Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya — are likely to take hits, he said. He expects 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Gilenya sales.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""Ocrevus grabbed two FDA approvals: for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrevus is the only drug approved for the latter form of MS.Initially, the drug will likely be most concentrated in major multiple sclerosis treatment centers, but over time Porges expects increased uptake among MS physicians who will likely switch their preferred injectable treatment to Ocrevus from Tysabri.In the primary progressive MS market, Ocrevus will grab 60% share within three to four years, Porges estimated. Specialists expect 20% of patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS to switch to Ocrevus within the next year.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it outperforms eight in 10 of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags leader Celgene with a best-possible CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of biotech leaders.Porges cut his price target on Biogen stock to 290 from 300, though he kept his market perform rating on the stock. Biogen sells six multiple sclerosis drugs which brought in $8.7 billion in sales in 2016, about 80% of total revenue that year.Based on Ocrevus' looming launch, Porges cut his expectations of Biogen sales by 2%-5% vs. his earlier forecast. He expects Biogen's MS franchise to pull in $7.8 billion by 2020, at a decline of 3%-4% per year. Earnings estimates were cut by 3% each year.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen stock was off 0.8% to 268.73. Roche stock slipped less than 0.4% to 31.92.RELATED:Acorda, Forward, Biogen Fall On Multiple Sclerosis Drug FightAcorda, Forward Stocks Plunge On Multiple Sclerosis Court RulingsRoche Multiple Sclerosis Drug OK Bittersweet For Beleaguered Biogen

163,MS,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) is aiming to save $21 million annually by cutting loose 20% of its workforce, the drugmaker said after a judge invalidated four patents protecting multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra.But the cuts could have been — and still might be — much deeper, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich wrote in a note to clients Thursday. He cut his price target on Acorda stock to 18 from 19, but kept his neutral rating on shares.""Acorda has previously spoken of a cost-saving contingency plan that would be enacted if Ampyra's long-term patent protection was lost,"" he said, adding he had ""assumed the first round of cuts would be deeper and a second round could come around the time of the generic launch next year.""Wall Street has long suspected companies like Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) are waiting in the wings to make a copy of Ampyra. Ampyra is approved to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis. It brought in $493 million in net 2016 sales.Trbovich estimates 120 of Acorda's 597 employees, as of Feb. 20, will be laid off within the month. Acorda said the majority of the head count reduction would take place in April with an expected $8 million in severance and related costs.Layoffs are not expected in the 100-person sales force, Trbovich said. The cuts are disproportionately expected to effect the research and development department. Restructuring is expected to save $5.25 million every three months beginning in the second quarter.Restructuring will allow Acorda to refocus on Parkinson's disease drugs CVT-301 and tozadenant. Acorda will also work to push Ampyra 10-milligram extended-release pills through July 2018, when they lose patent protection.""Over the last several years, we have strategically diversified our portfolio and we believe that CVT-301 and tozadenant can be a platform for significant future growth,"" Chief Executive Ron Cohen said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda Therapeutics has an IBD Composite Rating of 14, meaning it underperforms more than eight in 10 of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. A better-rated leader would be Celgene with a top-of-the-class CR of 99. Find the best picks on Stock Checkup.Acorda plans to update its 2017 financial guidance during the first-quarter earnings conference call on April 27.At the close on the stock market today, Acorda stock was flat, at 17.05, after five days in the red.In similar news, Biogen (BIIB) recently won an interference case vs. Forward Pharma (FWP) over MS drug Tecfidera.

164,MS,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

The tech-heavy composite index remained down about 0.1%, well off its early lows. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average both lagged with losses of less than 0.2%.Volume soared on the NYSE, but fell slightly on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday.Among the Dow industrials in the stock market today, Goldman Sachs (GS) heavily weighed on the Dow 30 with a 1.8% loss. Other laggards include General Electric (GE), which fell 1.2%.On the upside, DuPont (DD) and Pfizer (PFE) tacked on 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively.Financials were among the biggest laggards in early trading. Global investment bank, Morgan Stanley (MS), dropped over 3%, while online broker, Charles Schwab (SCHW), declined 2%. Recent IPO, Snap (SNAP) continued its rise from its post-IPO lows, rising almost 5% after the social media company received multiple bullish ratings from analysts.Jefferies gave Snap a price target of 30 saying, ""We believe Snap has all the ingredients to build a robust advertising business."" Goldman Sachs set a 27 price target, while Morgan Stanley set theirs to 28.Snap went public at 17 a share on March 2.Apple (AAPL) saw its own price target hiked on Monday as JPMorgan (JPM) added the iPhonemaker to its ""Focus List."" The price target was raised to 165 from 142. Shares moved down 0.1%.Among market leaders, Tesla (TSLA) recovered from early losses to jump over 1.4% as it continues to consolidate above its 50-day line.

166,MS,"Oprah Winfrey collected the biggest compensation among the directors of Weight Watchers International last year, despite skipping several board gatherings and not attending the company's annual meeting.Winfrey, who agreed in 2015 to buy a stake in the weight-loss company and join its board, received $264,753 for her services last year, according to a regulatory filing Monday. That's more than twice the amount given to the second-highest-paid director, Denis Kelly. Winfrey's pay included a benefits-plan contribution tied to her promotional work for the company that no other director received.Weight Watchers also disclosed that Winfrey was the sole director to attend fewer than 75% of the board's 10 meetings in 2016. The 63-year-old also was a no-show at the Weight Watchers annual meeting, and Winfrey won't attend this year's shareholder meeting on May 9.""Ms. Winfrey attended a majority of the 2016 board meetings,"" New York-based Weight Watchers said in an emailed statement. ""When unable to attend a meeting, Ms. Winfrey was able to be represented by a personal designee.""In the filing, the board said it expects ""directors to attend and participate in all meetings of the board of directors."" It didn't provide an explanation for Winfrey's absences other than ""scheduling conflicts"" during the company's annual meetings.Winfrey's attendance falls below the standards set by proxy advisory firms, such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co., which give guidance to shareholders on director elections. Both firms generally recommend withholding votes for directors who attend fewer than 75% of board and committee meetings, unless acceptable reasons for the absences are disclosed.Still, there's little risk of Winfrey losing her seat. The media magnate owns 14.7% of Weight Watchers, including a block of unexercised stock options. And she has a voting agreement with the company's largest shareholder, Luxembourg-based Artal Group, which owns 46% of the shares. The arrangement qualifies the company as a controlled entity. Winfrey, whose term expires in 2018, is therefore all but certain to get support of a majority of the voting shares.Winfrey, who has a net worth of $3.2 billion, sent Weight Watchers' shares soaring when it was announced that she'd agreed to act as a spokeswoman for the brand. Since then, she's buoyed the company's volatile stock by discussing her weight loss on the program in tweets and TV ads.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq briefly touched an all-time high in early trading before reversing lower. Volume was tracking significantly higher across both main exchanges vs. the same time on Friday.Among the Dow industrial stocks in the stock market today, Intel's (INTC) recent rally continued in earnest as the stock jumped near 1%. Shares reclaimed the 50-day line as the stock builds the right side of flat base. On the downside, financial component Goldman Sachs (GS) and Caterpillar (CAT) dragged the blue-chip index lower with losses amounting to 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively.The financial sector was heavily targeted by sellers in midday trading. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Online broker Charles Schwab (SCHW) dropped 1.8% as it found resistance around its 50-day line.Tesla (TSLA) jumped 5% after the company announced it had delivered over 25,000 vehicles in Q1, above its target and the Street's estimates. Shares broke out of a cup-shaped base with a 287.49 buy point. SodaStream (SODA) was approaching its own buy point. The Israeli-based company is forming a flat base with a 51.35 entry. Shares were up 3.8%. FANG stocks were mixed heading into midday trading.

Alphabet traded up 0.4% as it recovers from a trip under the 50-day.Facebook (FB) dropped 0.5%, while Netflix (NFLX) declined over 1%.Among other market leaders, Nvidia (NVDA) moved down 0.6% as it battles for support around its 50-day. The chip-leader has been building a base since early February.Action within leading growth stocks was mixed as strength among China-based companies was offset by weakness among financials. Three of the top five performers were China-based with Tarena International (TEDU) pacing the advancers with a 2.7%. Shares are extended from a 17.85 cup buy point.

168,MS,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) and Forward Pharma (FWP) stocks took a sharp dive Friday on court decisions related to multiple sclerosis drugs Ampyra and Tecfidera.A district court judge ruled four patents invalid protecting MS drug Ampyra set to expire between 2025-27, Acorda said in a news release. The judge determined that Ampyra's method of treatment was not distinctive enough to be considered patent-worthy, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis said.The trial did uphold a patent pertaining to 10-milligram, extended release tablets. That patent is set to expire in July 2018, meaning Acorda could be open to generic competition next year, Matteis said in a note to clients.""We are disappointed by the court's decision and are preparing our appeal,"" Acorda Chief Executive Ron Cohen said in a prepared statement. ""Medical innovation depends on the recognition of valid intellectual property claims. We believe that we demonstrated novel and unexpected findings in our Ampyra development program that led to the issuance of valid patents.""In afternoon trading ,Acorda stock hit a two-month low, falling 21.5% to close at 21.00 on the stock market today.Acorda has ""contingency plans to address its business needs and objectives in the event of a loss of Ampyra exclusivity,"" the company said. Ampyra comprised 95% of Acorda's total sales in 2016, but the company is also working on clinical testing for Parkinson's and acute migraine drugs.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 53, meaning it outperforms about half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

Forward Pharma shares tumbled 20% to finish at 21.55., after a judge ruled in Biogen's favor in an interference case over multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera.Biogen stock rose 1.6% to 273.42. The duo had already settled a rivaling case for $1.25 billion.If Biogen had lost the interference case, it would have had to pay Forward a 10% royalty on Tecfidera sales starting in 2021, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients. He also noted Biogen's patent is locked through 2028 vs. a 2025 expiration for Forward's patent.RELATED:Biogen Pays Forward Pharma $1.25 Billion To Settle Tecfidera SuitAcorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect Ampyra: RBC

169,MS,"The stock market reversed early gains as the sell-off continued to worsen in midday trading.Particularly concerning was the Nasdaq's bearish outside reversal day. After exceeding Monday's high, the composite is now trading below yesterday's low. Today's action could signify that the market needs to take a breather.The Nasdaq retreated 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each dropped 0.8%. Volume was tracking higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. Monday's trading, further fueling today's negative action.Among the Dow industrials in the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) traded down 0.2% as shares reversed lower. The company debuted a red iPhone 7, an upgraded, lower-cost iPad, and an app for making short videos called Clips. Coca-Cola (KO) led the industrials with a 0.7% gain as investors sought safer havens amid the sell-off.On the downside, Caterpillar (CAT) was one of the biggest laggards, falling 2.6% after meeting resistance at the 50-day moving average. Other laggards include Goldman Sachs (GS) and Boeing (BA). Goldman Sachs is trading under the 50-day for the first time since early February. Shares fell 2.6%. Boeing shares dropped 1.6% as they continue to pull back from recent highs.In early trading, much of the market's damage was concentrated on the financial sector, while large-cap technology stocks like the FANG stocks were mostly unscathed. However, by midday the weakness had spread throughout the market and even FANG stocks are being severely impacted.Global investment banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America, (BAC) fell 3.7% and 5.2%, respectively.Market leader Facebook (FB) jumped to record highs after the company was upgraded to buy at BTIG Research. However, after being up as much as 2%, shares are now trading 0.4% lower.Amazon (AMZN) moved down 1% as it hovers above a 843.94 cup-with-handle entry.Netflix (NFLX) declined 1.3% after reaching a new high in early trading.Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 1.5% and is trading below a 867.10 flat-base buy point.Among leading growth stocks, no stocks were trading in the green, but there were several that were barely negative.France-based Criteo (CRTO) and China-based TAL Education (TAL) reversed lower in heavy volume.Regional banks fell in line with the balance of the financial sector. The worst-performing bank was Western Alliance, (WAL) which dropped over 6% as it pierced its 50-day on heavy volume.

170,MS," The market sell-off showed little signs of applying the brakes in the dying minutes of Tuesday's session. Banking, biotech and select metals firms including steel production and metal ores led the decline.With minutes left in the session, the Nasdaq composite accelerated its drop in the final hour of trading, falling 1.8% as large and megacap techs retreated. It's clearly going to be the Nasdaq's biggest single-session drop since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The S&P 500 was down nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average provided no relief as it too fell more than 0.9%. Volume expanded sharply vs. Monday, meaning that it is likely to be a true distribution day, or session of intense professional selling.A spate of four or five such distribution days is enough to end a bull market, or at the minimum trigger a mild correction in the range of 5% to 10%.Small caps took bigger hits as the Russell 2000 fell more than 2.6% and dipped back into slightly negative ground for the year. In 2016, the popular small-cap equity index rallied 19.5%. Major Wall Street banks sold off on growing concern about what impact Britain's future exit from the eurozone will have on London's status as a major banking center.Goldman Sachs (GS), which announced that it will move hundreds of employees out of the United Kingdom capital in preparation for the changes, dropped 8.32 points, or more than 3%, and slumped sharply below its 50-day moving average. Volume was running about 26% above average levels.The Wall Street bank, which has thrived by recent movement in U.S. Treasury bonds, is triggering its first major sell signal since breaking out of a long first-stage base with a 172.52 buy point in late October. The gain reached as high as 48%, big enough to have justified taking profits on the way up.One could decide to sell at least half a position bought at the proper entry, then see if the Dow Jones industrials component can rebound back to its 50-day line. For now, shares are trading less than 9% below the 255.15 high.Fellow money-center banks — Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY), as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) — are also down between 0.5% and 4% and showing weak action near their respective 50-day lines. Superregional lender SVB Financial (SIVB) took out its 50-day moving average for the first time since its early October breakout from a large bottoming-style base. Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif., firm slumped more than 6% to 175.84 in more than double average trade. At its 198.83 peak, SVB rose as much as 76% from the 112.93 handle entry.Also in IBD's superregional bank industry group, Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) and SunTrust Banks (STI) of Atlanta dropped more than 5% in heavy turnover and triggered the 50-day line sell rule.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a top-rated company in IBD's West/Southwest bank group, got slammed with a 7% drop to 47.05, also sinking below its 50-day line in volume running nearly four times usual levels.The stock also triggered the golden rule of selling by falling more than 7% below a recent new flat base entry at 50.82.IBD 50 stocks were not immune to the blanket-like sell-off.China's top internet video game firm NetEase (NTES) slid nearly 4% to 282.59. Yet for now, the stock is holding above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and keeping the air pocket created by an earnings-inspired Feb. 16 big gap up in price. The stock is also still extended more than 5% past a 257.78 cup-with-handle entry point.Cognex (CGNX) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) both fell more than 2% in heavy trading. The former has already gained more than 50% since clearing a 53.55 flat-base entry, while the latter pulled back near a 48.05 flat-base buy point. Yet Veeva has also risen significantly since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 28.05 in May 2016.Keeping gains by selling at least half the position after the rally has exceeded 20% to 25% is a smart portfolio management technique for your growth stocks.On the upside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is staging an eighth straight up-day, rising 1% to 112.93. That pushed the gaming resort operator's advance to 8% past a 104.49 buy point, in a choppy cup-with-handle base — so shares are extended. Wynn has large operations in Macau, the island territory of China where casino gambling is legalized. Wall Street sees full-year profit rising 27% to $4.29 a share in 2017, then up another 16% to $4.99 in 2018.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow-30 Stocks?When To Sell A Stock: Take Profits When 2 Or More Key Rules Get TriggeredWhen To Sell A Stock II: Use The 50-Day Moving Average As A Guide

The S&P 500 held a fractional gain. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 fell 0.5%. Volume was lower across the board in the stock market today vs. the same time Friday.Gold, chip design and jewelry stocks led the upside, while solar energy, department store and oil issues underperformed. West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 1.4% to $48.11 a barrel.Banks fell early but reversed higher, with JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) up slightly on the Dow. Both stocks are only about 4% off their highs, but Goldman momentarily slipped below its 50-day moving average.Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1% to slightly breach its 50-day line. It's 5% off its 52-week high.Most stocks got a lift after the Fed Wednesday announced an expected quarter-point rate hike, but banks fell along with Treasury yields. The 10-year bond was slightly lower early Monday, down 0.2% to just below 2.5%.Disney, up 1%, led the upside among blue chips. It remains in buy range from a 112.09 flat-base entry first cleared last week. Shares are on track to close at a 52-week high. The entertainment giant's live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"" movie scored big in the box office.Among other Dow stocks, Wal-Mart and Apple each gained nearly 1%.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) leapt 4% in robust trade but reversed lower.

172,MS,"Lower Treasury yields Friday pressured most financials, including Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS) and American Express (AXP).But Visa (V), the second-best performer on the Dow industrials this year, rose to a fresh all-time high Friday. Its archrival Mastercard (MA) also reached record levels and its stock is still within buy range.The 10-year yield fell below 2.5% intraday, resuming their retreat following the Fed's rate hike on Wednesday, as policymakers did not signal faster tightening ahead.Rates on mortgages and the value of other types of credit are tied in with those yields. The yields also serve as a window into investors' expectations for higher prices in the future — potentially prompting the Fed to raise the benchmark interest rate, which, in turn, can help banks' finances as banks hike their own interest rates and other costs to compensate.Visa rose 0.2% to 90.21 in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high of 90.63  intraday. The stock has been tailing upward since the beginning of the year, logging a 16% gain since Dec. 30.Mastercard climbed 0.1% to 112.83, wthin range of a 109.03 buy point of a flat base initially cleared in mid-January. Mastercard sold off at the end of the month, closing below its 50-day line on Feb. 1. But the stock rebounded, retaking its still-value 109.03 buy point and marching on to new highs.Visa has been gaining on a variety of factors. Among them: stronger consumer optimism, the acquisition of Visa Europe, and the potential in cross-border and electronic payments.Visa and Mastercard, while known for their credit cards, are not technically card issuers. They make money on transaction fees, and aren't directly affected by interest rate shifts. Issuing banks, such as JPMorgan Chase,  Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), actually carry the balances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks and financials have been among the biggest Trump plays this year, on hopes for a combination of fewer regulations and higher interest rates. Steel stocks, potential beneficiaries of Trump's plans for a massive infrastructure investment, are among the others. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.05%, Bank of America 1.4%, Citigroup 1.3% and Wells Fargo 1.1%.Goldman Sachs and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, both closing just above their 50-day lines.The Dow's American Express, which does issue cards directly and carry the balances, trickled 0.65% lower. Capital One (COF), which also issues cards, fell 2.2%, undercutting its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This YearDow Stock American Express Ups Ante In High-Fee, High-End Card Race

173,MS,"XThe Nasdaq composite rose to an all-time high Friday afternoon as the major market averages gradually moved higher and as conservative plays were showing strength.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.2%, with the S&P 500 and Dow less than 1% of their all-time bests. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2% too. Volume in the quadruple witching session in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Strength was showing up in conservative instruments. The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.7%, and top groups for the day included diversified companies, food and tobacco — all defensive plays.In IBD's Big Cap 20, the day's biggest gainer was chipmaker Microchip Technology (MCHP), up 1% in meek volume. The biggest loser was California-based Amgen (AMGN). The stock gapped down more than 6% to rub against its 50-day line on news of a drug study. The study found that Amgen's cholesterol drug Repatha cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20%. But there was no reduction in deaths. How insurers respond to the study will be key. Amgen has had some troubles getting insurers to cover the expensive drug.Despite the big price drop, Amgen was finding support at the 50-day line. Earnings for Amgen are pedestrian — up 11% in each of the past three quarters. Revenue growth was 6%, 2% and 8% in the same quarters.The biotech stock group fell 1%, with Amgen and five other stocks in the group falling 5% or more.Chips, which constitute the No. 1 sector among 33 sectors, rose modestly. Banks, which were the No. 3 sector going into Friday's session, were mostly down.Morgan Stanley (MS) dropped nearly  2% in average volume, but the stock held above its 50-day line. Citigroup (C) fell less thawn 1% in average volume, but the stock is close to a 61.73 buy point.Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) pared earlier losses to trade down a fraction, holding above its 50-day line.While the action was bad, the big money centers were holding above their 50-day moving averages, the only exceptions being some of the Canadian banks. Several megacap money centers were falling in strong volume, but the volume was fading in the afternoon.Volume on a quadruple witching day — which involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures — often boosts volume, making interpretation difficult.Economic news was mixed Friday.The Federal Reserve's industrial production report for February came in flat vs. the consensus estimate for a 0.2% gain. Manufacturing was slightly better than expected, and capacity utilization was in line with views.The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for March rolled in at 97.6 vs. the consensus estimate of 97.2. Leading indicators for February also topped views, 0.6% vs. 0.4%.The Baker-Hughes rig count showed that the North American tally fell almost 2% from the previous week, but rose almost 3% in the U.S.RELATED:Three Restaurant Stocks Are Closing In On Buy PointsAmgen, Rivals Drop On Study Results

174,MS,"Bank stocks like Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) opened higher Wednesday on the strength of ADP's monthly jobs report, which blew past expectations.The economy added 298,000 private-sector jobs in February, the best gain in nearly three years far past estimates for 183,000. The torrid acceleration shown in the ADP report comes ahead of the official government job figures for February, which are set for release Friday.The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps determine rates on mortgages and is a measure of inflation expectations, had risen to 2.56%, continuing a recent revival back to near postelection highs. Higher yields and a wider yield spread should be good for banks profits.Bond yields have been rallying on growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike at the end of the March 14-15 meeting. Fed officials have signaled that a move is likely, with markets pricing in a 91% chance that it'll happen. Investors now see about a 50-50 chance of a second hike by June's Meeting.JPMorgan Chase rose as high as 92.85 soon after the opening bell, but closed down 0.2% to 91.21 in the stock market today. Goldman Sachs reversed to close down 0.3%.Bank of America (BAC) settled up 0.2% while Citigroup (C) advanced 1%, with both also well off the day's best levels.Wells Fargo (WFC) reversed to finish down 0.15%. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: Many businesses don't exactly benefit when interest rates rise. Bank stocks are different in that they actually do. JPMorgan and Goldman leaped to record highs last week after two more dovish Fed officials, John Williams and William Dudley, indicated that a rate hike could be on the horizon and that economy was gaining steam.Then, last Friday, Fed chair Janet Yellen said a rate hike this month ""would likely be appropriate,"" assuming the economy didn't suddenly falter. She also indicated the Fed would likely institute three rate hikes this year.RELATED:JPMorgan Cautious On Benefits From Tax Cuts, Fewer RegulationsJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

The S&P 500 dropped 0.1%. Turnover showed solid increases on both the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday.Among the Dow industrials, action was mostly quiet. On the upside, IBM (IBM) paced the advancers with a 1% gain. Big Blue found support at the 50-day moving average on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley (MS) raised its price target to 212 from 187.Among the laggards, DuPont (DD) and Chevron (CVX) both fell about 1%.Electric auto maker Tesla (TSLA) jumped 3% after the company announced plans to raise more than $1 billion.

Snap traded down nearly 3% to 20.16, near post-IPO lows.Among stocks breaking out today, Nucor (NUE) popped 2.9% to 65.26, pulling back after rising as high as 66, above a 65.50 cup-with-handle entry. The steel producer issued bullish Q1 guidance.Quantenna Communications (QTNA), the high speed wireless company, broke out of cup-with-handle base with a 23.23 buy point as shares rocketed 9.5%. Consensus estimates show the company's annual earnings growing 700% in 2017 and 238% in 2018. The company debuted in October 2016.Nvidia (NVDA), ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50, moved up 0.8% after the company announced that it was working with Paccar (PCAR), the truck manufacturer, to develop a technology for autonomous vehicles. On Wednesday, it was reported that Nvidia had partnered with Bosch, the German technology company, to develop a self-driving computer.Among other leading growth stocks, Chinese companies Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) led the charge, with Veeva Systems (VEEV) right behind them.Weibo traded 3% higher as it attempts to build the right side of a new base. Momo moved up 2.8% to notch a fresh record high. Veeva added 2.4% to 49.02 and is now extended from a 45.95 aggressive entry. The stock also is within range after clearing a conventional 48.05 buy point.On the downside, Masimo (MASI) sold off almost 4% on heavy volume. After an incredible run from 60 to 96 in the last three months, today's action is the first chink in the medical stock's armor.

177,MS,"Media: The mainstream press turned on Rachel Maddow after her disastrous attempt to drum up ratings by hyping a humdrum Donald Trump tax return. Why are they upset? She just did what they've been doing since Trump got elected.After teasing a ""huge scoop"" on Twitter — that she had Trump's tax returns — Maddow got scooped by the White House, which announced a half-hour before her show started that Trump paid $38 million in taxes in 2005, which was all Maddow had.That's a huge amount of taxes by any standard, and represented 24% of Trump's income that year. It didn't take long for others to point out this effective rate was higher President Obama's (19%) or Socialist Bernie Sanders (13%), or even the average paid by MSNBC's parent company, Comcast, between 2008 and 2012 (24%).Trump's tax rate also happens to be far higher than the richest 1% — or even the richest 0.001% — of taxpayers paid that year, according to IRS data. In fact, filers making $50 million or more in 2005 paid an average tax rate of 19%.So if Trump is guilty of anything, it's not arranging his affairs well enough to shield his income from taxes.But Maddow soldiered on, spending 20 minutes teeing up her non-story.It was a disaster of such monumental proportions that even her colleagues in the liberal press couldn't bear it.The Washington Post-owned liberal opinion site Slate decried how Maddow managed to turn her ""big scoop about Donald Trump's long-missing tax returns into a cautionary tale about overhype.""Writing for CNBC, Jay Yarow said that ""Trump just got a nice victory, thanks, of all people, to Rachel Maddow.""Jon Levine told his readers on Mediaite that Maddow had ""just trolled us all for ratings.""The New York Times reported that ""on Twitter, journalists complained that Ms. Maddow had overhyped her findings with the initial teasing tweet, noting that the information in the returns did not amount to a scandal.""CNN fretted that Maddow ""teed up a major scoop ... only to end up disappointing many in the political-media establishment with a report that was widely characterized as overhyped.""Maddow's real sin, however, wasn't in overhyping her story. It was that she was woefully clumsy in the way she handled her anti-Trump zealotry.After all, the rest of the media have been overhyping anti-Trump stories as soon as he secured the GOP nomination, a campaign that has gone into overdrive since the November elections.The result has been a tsunami of earth-shattering scoops about Trump in the mainstream press that have turned out to be either entirely untrue, grossly misleading or wildly exaggerated.One month into the Trump administration, the Washington Examiner's Paul Bedard added up 30 anti-Trump stories that turned out to be false.Remember the Iraqi mom who died because of Trumps travel ban? Didn't happen. Or how Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had foreclosed on a 90-year-old woman because of a 27-cent payment error? Nope. Or how Trump had removed an MLK bust from the Oval Office? He hadn't.We've covered many others in this space. Those ""spontaneous"" airport demonstrations? They were staged. The clam that Rick Perry didn't know that the Department of Energy handled the nation's nuclear arsenal? He did. Or that HHS Secretary Tom Price was guilty of insider trading? Not true. Remember the claim that Russian propaganda officials had successfully spread pro-Trump fake news before the election? Nope.There's no question that all this fake news is driving down Trump's approval ratings, even as most people support his policies and grow more optimistic about the future because of them.But the public is, at least, catching on. The latest IBD/TIPP poll finds that 54% believe that the media have ""assumed the role of the opposition party, constantly opposing the president and his policies at every turn."" It also found that most aren't confident that the press will cover Trump fairly.So from the media's perspective, Maddow's only real sin was in making it painfully obvious just how untrustworthy the press has become.RELATED:After Ignoring Obama Scandals For 8 Years, Reporters Are Now Making Them Up About TrumpIBD/TIPP Poll: Public Turned Off By Media's Relentlessly Negative Coverage Of TrumpSorry, Bush Is Wrong — The Media Aren't Doing Their Job

178,MS,"An aerospace industry group sent a letter to congress Friday backing Republican plans to overall the tax system as member and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) will break ground on a new finishing plant in China by the end of the month.""We urge you to enact legislation that modernizes our tax system, allows America's businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages job creation and innovation in the United States,"" the Aerospace Industries Association of America said in its letter to congress said according to Reuters.In a letter made public by the AIA, the group said the proposed House corporate tax reform blueprint would ""benefit American businesses and American workers across the board.""The blueprint would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% from 25% and would add a border adjustment tax.Last month Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Dow industrials peer General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, and other industrial exporters along with drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY) and others wrote their own letter to congress urging support for the bill.Boeing has a lot to gain from the proposed tax overhaul. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts released a note Monday saying that Boeing's stock could jump 40% from the border adjustment tax alone.Boeing shares were down 0.2% to 178.73 on the stock market today. GE stock fell 1.1% to 29.54.Not all businesses support the House's blueprint. Wal-Mart (WMT), another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers whose goods would become more expensive.Wal-Mart shares were up 1.1% to 70.72, retaking their 200-day moving average.While the tax blueprint is supposed to support jobs at home, Boeing will break ground on its finishing plant in Zhoushan by the end of March, according to a report from China's business media outlet Caixin out Tuesday.Boeing announced plans for the facility to finish 737s and started preliminary work in 2015 as it looks to build market share in the rapidly growing aerospace market. The workers at the plant will paint planes and install in-flight entertainment and other systems.While some work is being outsourced to China, Boeing has argued the plant will create more, not less, American jobs.""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in January.

179,MS,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) was downgraded Monday but analysts are bullish that a proposed border tax could boost shares.Morgan Stanley (MS) downgraded Boeing to equal weight from overweight on ""light"" order flow, but raised its price target to 190 from 185. But the aerospace giant's shares could hit 250 if Congress passes a border adjustment tax. Back in December, Morgan Stanley analysts said Boeing could pay little or no corporate income tax via a BAT, and could even get Treasury to cut checks to the aerospace giant.President Trump has backed the idea of a border adjustment tax, but hasn't endorsed any specific version, including the House GOP plan.Separately, Boeing announced an order from CBD Aviation Lease Finance for 30 737 Max 8 airplanes. The order was previously unidentified on Boeing's website and is listed at $3.3 billion at current prices.Boeing shares reversed higher to close up 0.2% at 179.05 on the stock market today. European rival Airbus' (EADSY) U.S.-listed shares finished 0.3% lower.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Dow industrials peer General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, and other industrial exporters along with drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY) and others wrote a letter last month urging congressional support for the House corporate tax reform blueprint, which includes the border adjustment tax.But the border tax faces an uphill battle in Washington. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called the border tax ""Orwellian"" last month and said it would hit Arkansas-based Wal-Mart (WMT) and raise consumer prices. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., has also spoken out against the tax.Wal-Mart, another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's budget plan, which could be released Thursday, will give more details about his $54 million increase in defense spending, putting some defense stocks near buy range. Fellow Dow industrials stock Exxon Mobil (XOM) has pushed back against the tax and said it would ""continue to advocate for free-market principles"" with a ""globally competitive"" and ""stable"" tax framework.Integrated global oil majors like Exxon, Dow industrials peer Chevron (CVX) as well as BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) import oil for their refinery operations.Exxon shares retreated 0.2%. Chevron shares fell 1.1%.The Morgan Stanley analysts were also bullish on ""US-led economic stimulus"" and the possibility of ""growing global military spending per rising budgets and allies matching spending of peers as well as new program bids"" for Boeing.RELATED:Boeing Shops New Midrange Aircraft Design To Potential CustomersWhy Trump's 10% Tariff Idea Isn't BAT CrazyTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax ReformThese Six Dow Components Back Border Tax, But Shallow Support Shows Why It's In Trouble

182,MS,"Momenta (MNTA) and Pfizer (PFE) are unexpectedly giving Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) some breathing room on a generic version of MS drug Copaxone after a manufacturing delay announced late Friday for a Teva rival drug — prompting Teva stock to rebound Tuesday.In the stock market today, Teva stock lifted as much as 7.8% to a six-week high of 37.94, closing Tuesday's regular session at 36.64, up 4.1%. Momenta stock, on the other hand, tumbled 15% to 16.05, crashing below its 50-day moving average. Momenta is partnering with Novartis (NVS) subsidiary Sandoz on the generic drug. Novartis stock slipped 0.21% Tuesday to 77.04.The Food and Drug Administration issued Pfizer a warning letter following an inspection of one of its fill/finish factories. That factory is a key piece of Momenta/Sandoz's supply chain for 40-milligram Glatopa, the generic rival to Copaxone.Momenta says it's unlikely the FDA will approve the 40-mg drug in Q1.""Under FDA policy, an approval of the application is dependent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations at the Pfizer facility used to make the final product,"" Momenta said late Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock is ranked ninth in IBD's 17-company generic drugs industry group with a Composite Rating of 28 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup for a list of the top five generic drugmakers.Analysts broadly pushed back their timelines for Glatopa's 40-mg launch to Q2 and Q3. The letter doesn't restrict the production or shipment of 20-mg Glatopa already marketed by Sandoz in the U.S.The delay could also put Mylan (MYL) and partner Natco in the lead on generic filing, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in a research report. She has an underperform rating and 27 price target on Teva stock.""Mylan previously indicated to us that the Copaxone first-filer status is shared, which may unexpectedly put Mylan's molecule in the lead if it can gain FDA approval ahead of Momenta,"" she wrote. ""We currently model both generic launches in the second half of 2017.""Mylan stock edged up 0.59% Tuesday to 42.30.Koffler expects Momenta's 40-mg Glatopa to launch in Q3 and Mylan's product in Q4.RBC analyst Randall Stanicky called the delay on Glatopa 40-mg opportune for Teva.RELATED:Acorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect AmpyraTeva Maintains 2017 Guidance Despite Copaxone Patent Losses; Q4 TopsTeva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock Dives

183,MS,"Bank stocks, including Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), rallied Wednesday as the odds for a Fed rate hike this month continued to surge following bullish commentary from the central bank's policymakers.The upswing in financials helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average above 21,000, as the major averages had their best day of 2017.Shares of JPMorgan jumped 3.3% to 93.60, hitting a fresh record high in the stock market today. Bank of America (BAC), whose large U.S. operations make it more sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations, leapt 3.3% to its best since 2008.Citigroup (C) added 2.9% to 61.54, hitting an eight-year high intraday but closing below a 61.73 buy point. Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 2.5%, setting its top levels since 2008, while Wells Fargo (WFC) climbed 3.2% to a record high.Goldman, whose large trading desk could benefit from market volatility — including the kind that might come from President Trump's tweets — rallied 1.9%, also setting an all-time best.The gains come a day after San Francisco Fed President John Williams, a policy dove, said a rate hike ""is on the table for serious consideration"" at the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting beginning on March 14.New York Fed President William Dudley, seen as being more dovish on rates, also expressed optimism Tuesday about the economy, saying ""animal spirits have been unleashed a bit"" since the election.And last week, minutes from the most recent Fed policymakers' meeting said that many in the meeting felt a rate hike should come ""fairly soon."" The odds for a March increase in the federal funds rate — the benchmark interest rate charged on overnight loans — rose to 66% Wednesday, after surging past 60% on Tuesday. On Monday, the odds were 31%.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are among the only S&P 500 stocks that actually benefit from higher rates. After years of low interest rates following the financial crisis and recession, Wall Street has been throwing its money at bank shares since the election.Analysts are expecting the Trump administration to pave the way for lower regulations, tax cuts and a massive infrastructure investment. Those measures, they say, would add jobs, push up wages and inflation expectations, prompting the Fed to raise rates to temper borrowing and overheating.When the benchmark rate rises, those extra costs ripple through the financial system, allowing banks to charge customers more for loans and other products and services.RELATED:

184,MS,"No. 2 biotech Celgene (CELG) could bolster sales by $800 million on Receptos' ozanimod in multiple sclerosis, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Friday after Celgene unveiled strong phase three trial results for the drug.Ozanimod was acquired in Celgene's $7 billion purchase of Receptos in 2015. In a late-stage trial, the drug showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits in reducing annualized relapse rates at 1-milligram and 0.5-mg doses compared with Biogen's (BIIB) rival drug Anovex.The drug also hit on secondary endpoints, including a reduction in gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions and the number of new or enlarging T2 MRI lesions at month 12, according to Celgene's news release. Indications about its safety were similar to results shown in phase two, Celgene said.Specific data will be released at an ""upcoming international scientific meeting,"" Celgene said — potentially the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in May, RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene CEO Mark Alles defended pharmaceuticals and biotechs in the drug-pricing debate, saying innovation requires incentive. And be sure to head to IBD's Biotech & Pharma Stock page for the latest headlines from the sector.The safety profile for ozanimod will be particularly important in differentiating it from rivals. Biogen's Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya also hit on T2 legions, but Gilenya's label includes safety information on bradycardia and liver toxicity, Yee said.It's possible Celgene could have similar safety data on its label regarding bradycardia, he said.""How much this impacts the sales of the drug is unclear given Gilenya is going generic (in 2019) and first-dose monitoring is a bit of a hassle,"" he wrote. Ultimately, Celgene's bigger opportunity for ozanimod is in ulcerative colitis where it is slated to be the only pill so far.Credit Suisse's Young says she's most focused on Celgene's MS data in the first half of this year, UC data in 2018 and GED-301 in Crohn's disease in 2019. These readouts will give Wall Street confidence in Celgene's ability to replace Revlimid's patent losses, she said.In the stock market today, Celgene stock rose 2.1% to 121.11. Shares popped above their 50-day moving average on Wednesday after trading at or below that mark for the past month. Shares of Biogen fell 0.41% Friday, to 288.94.RELATED:Roche CEO Shrugs Off Trump's Drug Stance; 2016 Sales Narrowly MissLilly Hijacks J&J Diabetes Share In Q4; Trump-Rattled Sector DipsCelgene, Lilly, Merck Sit With Trump On His Calls To Manufacture In U.S.

186,MS,"  Imagine if John F. Kennedy's advisors had told him in 1961, we will never put a man on the moon.  Or what if Ronald Reagan's advisors had assured the Gipper: the Cold War is unwinnable; we should sue for peace.  Actually many naysayers told JFK and Reagan exactly these things, but fortunately these president were visionaries. They asked: ""Why not?""Donald Trump seems to confront these nattering nabobs of negativism in the media and academia every time he announces a policy goal. You can't build a wall.  You can't keep out illegal immigrants.  You can't root out the waste in government.  You can't get Europe to pay more for its own defense. You can never balance the budget.  And on and on.The one thing Washington is very good at is giving every excuse under the sun for why achievable things can't done.Which brings me to the revolt of the chattering class against Donald Trump's goal of 4% growth and millions of new jobs when his economic plan is implemented.The left and even some academics on the right laugh that this is a pipe dream.  CNN Money recently asked leading economists about Trump's promise and they found a strong consensus that ""4% growth is impossible, or at least highly unlikely."" Why?   They say there aren't enough workers with the retirement of the baby boomers and that automation means fewer jobs available. Productivity is apparantly tapped out.Even the latest 3% growth goal that Trump's budget team has projected was ridiculed. ""Experts"" point to a widely cited 2016 San Francisco Fed study which argues that the ""new normal"" is 1.5% to 1.75% GDP growth — or less than half the post-World War II average pace of progress.  Economists are sounding as myopic as the legendary patent office official who once proclaimed that everything that will be invented has been invented.So is achieving rapid growth in GDP now unachievable? In the 1960s, after the Kennedy tax cuts were implemented, the economy grew by 4% annually for about five years (1965-69 while  unemployment sank to record lows, and a gold-linked dollar held down inflation.In the 1980s, following the Reagan tax cut, the economy from 1983-89 the economy expanded at annual clip by closer to 3.75%.  Back then economist Paul Samuelson, a Nobel prize winner, declared that if the Reagan agenda were to produce high growth in outcome and jobs with declining inflation it would be ""a miracle.""  The miracle happened.So why not now?It's worth noting that when Barack Obama unveiled his Keynesian stimulus plans, the White House projected 3% plus rates of growth nearly every year.  He never hit 3% growth in a single year.   I don't recall hearing the hoots of protest against his plans achieving ""impossible"" rates of growth.One bogus argument for the new normal of slow growth is that the labor force growth necessary for high growth will not happen.  It is true that baby boomers are retiring at a pace of 10,000 a day.  But the notion that there isn't an available pool of workers to fill millions of new jobs from the tax cuts and deregulation is nonsense.  There are a record 95 million Americans out of the workforce today and a record low labor force participation rate.Yes, many of these workers are over the age of 65 and retired  But the biggest reduction in workforce participation has been younger people.  Meanwhile many workers over the age of 50 have seen their jobs disappear and have resigned themselves to early retirement.  We know that including the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work or can't find a full-time job means an unemployment rate twice as high as officially reported.We also know there are millions of Americans on disability or other welfare programs that aren't working. This isn't because there are more disabled people or that more people need government benefits like food stamps.  It is because the benefits are so much easier to get and thus welfare and disability have become costly substitutes for work. Put time limits and work requirements on these programs for employable adults and the labor force will accelerate quickly.There are potentially tens of millions of workers who could and should be working, but aren't.  Also, we can and should fix our immigration system so many more engineers, scientists, and skilled workers can get visas to come to the U.S. and fill open jobs.Then there is the issue of productivity.  Federal Reserve vice chair Stanley Fischer declared last year that slow growth in ""capital investment and productivity"" is the force that's ""holding down growth.""  No they aren't.  Investment has been low for the past decade because of liberal policies that punished capital investment.  Higher capital gains and dividend taxes, more onerous regulations, ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank, the massive increase in the national debt all have deterred investment.The war against business under Obama hopefully will become a peace treaty with business under Trump.  We know that there are hundreds of energy projects ready to go — these are investments — that Trump should greenlight in the months ahead.I'm of the belief that America is just entering a new stage of massive productivity gains as we enter the Digital Age Part Two.Artificial intelligence and robotics could double or triple the productivity of American manufacturing.  New drugs, vaccines, medical devices, artificial limbs, and medical procedures from our biotech industry will cure or alleviate cancer, heart disease, MS, Alzheimers, and many other debilitating illnesses that sap productivity.Then there are the automated autos and planes. These will reduce transportation shipping costs by 75% and 80% over the next two decades, leading to massive productivity gains for businesses.In other words, we are entering a golden age of productivity with undreamed of advances. We will produce more and more output with fewer and fewer workers needed.We get there mostly by getting the government out of the way.  Trump wants to do that. And if he does, 4% growth can and should be the new normal in America.

"
188,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are reportedly set to take lead roles in Saudi Aramco's IPO, which would dwarf Alibaba's (BABA) in proceeds and establish the oil behemoth's market cap as triple the size of Apple's (AAPL).Saudi Arabia hasn't officially said who the underwriters would be, although whomever is chosen in the highly anticipated offering would likely receive a windfall in fees.JPMorgan, which has a long history working with Saudi Arabia and the state-run Aramco, ""was close to being selected"" for an underwriting role, Reuters reported Tuesday. The bank has been helping the oil producer prepare for the offering, the Financial Times reported on Friday.JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley would likely be the global coordinators and bookrunners for the IPO, sources told FT.HSBC (HSBC) would also be among the top banks considered for underwriting duties, given its access to Asia and the Middle East, according to the Financial Times.Reuters also reported that an HSBC joint venture with Saudi British Bank, HSBC Saudi Arabia, was among six banks this month that sent Aramco proposals to advise the oil company on the planned IPO, which could come in 2018.Citigroup (C) and Deutsche Bank (DB) were also reported to be in the running for an underwriting role. Those banks still could play a large part in the offering, which could demand up to four global coordinators and 20 banks playing smaller roles, the Financial Times said on Friday.Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.9% to close at 91.01 on the stock market today. Morgan Stanley edged up 0.9% to 46.56. Citigroup added 0.6% to 60.55, Deutsche Bank rose 0.9% to 19.58, while HSBC sank 5.3% to 41.58 on disappointing earnings.IBD'S TAKE: As oil prices rebound, here's a look at the stocks that seem set to rebound with them. Saudi Aramco has been valued at more than $2 trillion, far more than Apple, whose market cap of more than $700 billion is seen as the world's biggest among publicly traded companies.The offering, for potentially 5% of the company, could generate $100 billion in proceeds, eclipsing Alibaba's record $25 billion IPO in 2014. The fees alone that banks involved in the IPO could earn have been estimated as high as $1 billion.The Aramco offering would help Saudi Arabia raise capital and help make its economy less oil-dependent following a long slump in oil prices. But listing on a public exchange would require more transparency for an often secretive government.The New York Stock Exchange appeared to be among Aramco's top picks for a listing. Exchanges in London and Toronto — also seen as prime capital-raising grounds for the energy industry — were also being considered by Aramco, according to the Wall Street Journal.The company seemed to be leaning toward listing on an Asian exchange, based on reports last year.Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, was expected to be among the exchanges where shares would be listed, the Journal report on Monday said. The listing on the Saudi exchange would likely be smaller than any listing on another exchange, Reuters said Tuesday.But the IPO could be pushed back to 2019, as the company separates its finances from the Saudi government, the Journal reported last week.RELATED:OPEC Wants Near-100% Compliance; Analysts Warn Of $30 OilOil Stockpiles Jump But Cushing Sees Dip; Shale Firm Sees Muted Costs

189,MS,"No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is likely to recapture market share from Impax Laboratories (IPXL) with its generic EpiPen during ""back to school"" shopping in July through September, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said Tuesday.Mylan expanded its patient assistance programs in the aftermath of September's EpiPen price controversy, brought on by the company bumping the cost of a two-pack of EpiPens to $600. Since then, Mylan has also launched a generic version at half the cost.The generic EpiPen has captured 12.3% of the market as of the week ended Feb. 17, Koffler wrote in a research report. Meanwhile, Impax's generic Adrenaclick has seen its share stabilize at around 26% for the past five weeks.""We expect the market dynamics to continue improving for Mylan into Q3 2017 when seasonal buying is at its highest, and note that comparisons should be much easier in 2017 after market disruption last year,"" she wrote.Mylan expects EpiPens to represent 6% of its sales in 2017 before declining to 5% in 2018. Koffler models $743.6 million in 2017 EpiPen sales, then a decline to $646 million in 2018. Those expectations follow the relaunch of Kaleo's highly priced Auvi-Q on Feb. 14.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 62 out of a best-possible 99, in measuring growth metrics like increases in revenue and profits. It's ranked third in the generic drugmakers group, but none of those stocks are very highly rated. For better stock ideas, head to IBD's Stock Checkup.Heading into Q4, Koffler is bullish on Mylan. The company is slated to report its fourth-quarter metrics midday Wednesday as part of its investor day in New York. Analysts broadly expect Mylan to report $3.17 billion in sales and $1.42 earnings per share excluding certain items.""We view Mylan as one of the best-positioned large generic players, but investors are still quite concerned about sector headwinds and (are) searching for a bottom signal,"" Koffler said. ""The March 1 Mylan call and investor day could prove reassuring if management provides a stable longer term outlook and realistic revenue and earnings targets for 2017.""Analysts currently model $5.33 adjusted earnings per share on $12.64 billion in sales for 2017. Koffler views $12.3 billion in sales and $5.63 earnings per share. She has a buy rating and 47 price target on Mylan stock.RELATED:Teva Downgraded On Lost MS Drug Patents, DOJ ProbeWill Mylan, Glaukos, Supernus Live Up To Q4 Growth Views Next Week?

190,MS,"Kite Pharma (KITE) outperformed med stocks Tuesday, gapping up on lymphoma trial results even as Perrigo (PRGO) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) made double-digit plunges, leading similar declines for Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Akorn (AKRX).By the closing bell on the stock market today, Kite stock had rocketed 24.3% to 70.66. Shares traded in a buy zone after hitting an entry point at 64.40 out of a consolidation period that began in August. Biotech stocks, though, were broadly down almost 1% Tuesday.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), too, jumped more than 2.7% to 24.04 on Kite's news. Both are working on drugs to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. At six months, Kite's drug, known as KTE-C19, showed a 31% complete response rate in 77 B-cell lymphoma patients, continuing the 33% response rate reported at three months.KTE-C19 achieved a best overall response rate of 82% and response rate of 49% in the patient group. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt noted the results are ""durable,"" and also set the bar for Juno's drug, known as JCAR017. Juno plans to begin a trial using JCAR017 in the same type of lymphoma patients during 2017.Biotech Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) saw shares charge higher by 6.1% to 49.77, well above their 50-day moving average on consensus-crushing, fourth-quarter metrics. Ionis posted 24 cents earnings per share excluding certain items, though analysts expected a 12-cent loss. Sales of $160.35 million topped by nearly $63 million.IBD'S TAKE: Want more on the biotech and pharma industry? Be sure to stop by IBD's Biotech & Pharma Stock page for best ideas in the sector.The upward stock motion Tuesday was largely limited to Kite and Ionis, though. Exelixis (EXEL) stock recovered from an earlier beating following Stifel Nicolaus analyst Stephen Willey's downgrade to a hold rating from buy. Willey cited Exelixis' inflated valuation and lack of inputs to support it for his downgrade.""Everything (is) going right"" at Exelixis, he wrote in a note. On Monday, Exelixis posted strong fourth-quarter results and announced immuno-oncology partnerships with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY). But shares fell 6.8% Tuesday, closing at 21.52.Tenet stock toppled 14.9% to 19.30 after reporting 6 cents earnings per share minus certain items on $4.85 billion in sales, missing the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 22 cents and $4.96 billion, respectively.Perrigo, though, continued on its downward stock path on Tuesday. Shares ended the day down 11.7% to 74.77 after a late Monday announcement that it would sell its royalty stream on multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri to RPI Finance Trust for $2.85 billion. Guidance for 2017 was also light.Valeant reported a strong fourth quarter with consensus-topping metrics, but shares dove 13.9% to close at 14.38 on earnings guidance for 2017 that lagged views. Valeant guided to $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion earnings before interest taxes and amortization, missing estimates for $3.88 billion.Akorn stock was walloped, falling 5.8% to 20.81 at the close.RELATED:Valeant Plunges On 2017 Earnings Outlook, 'Unrealistic' Brand SalesExelixis Rockets On Bristol, Roche I-O Ties Following Merck-Incyte TeamPerrigo Shares Plunge On Plans To Sell MS Drug Royalty Stream

193,MS,"Now that President Trump has ordered a delay of the Labor Department's controversial new fiduciary rule, which industry groups potentially stand to gain the most?The rule, which is slated to take effect April 10, requires financial advisors and brokers to recommend investments in the best interests of clients instead of those merely suitable. That would force advisors and brokers to put clients' interest ahead of their own profit.Financial firms have been deeply concerned about the potential effects of the new rule since it was approved last year. They fear it will hike advisory costs, making it less affordable for lower-income clients. That's why the delay has sharply boosted major banks and investment brokers.As of Thursday, 10 financial-related industry groups made the top 20 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. Life insurance, investment bankers and brokers, and money center banks have seen big recent gains.The life insurance group includes highly rated stocks such as Primerica (PRI), which bears a 98 Composite Rating but is extended from a 73.15 flat-base buy point. The Duluth, Ga.-based insurer is a Leaderboard member. Lincoln National (LNC), with a 91 Composite, is near the top of its buy range from a 69.69 flat-base entry. New issue Athene Holdings (ATH) (95) is extended from a 48.82 buy point of a flat base. Shares have rallied nearly 30% from a 40 offering price at the Dec. 9 debut.The investment bank group includes asset managers such as Raymond James Financial (RJF), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Piper Jaffray (PJC). Raymond James is trading near all-time highs as shares ride the 50-day moving average higher. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company shares the top Composite Rating, 99, in the 30-stock group.The money center banks group, which includes Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS),  jumped 3% Feb. 3 on the news of the delay. The group remains near highs, following a 24% rally from its close on Nov. 8, election day, to its Jan. 13 peak.All the above stocks (except Athene) have posted 28% or better gains since Trump was elected Nov. 8, amid views that he would loosen regulation in the financial market.IBD'S TAKE: Primerica and Lincoln National are among financial and insurance stocks enjoying a ""Trump Bump."" Find out who some others are in this recent Sector Leaders article.Morgan Stanley owns the top Composite, 98, in the group. Shares are far extended from a 32.47 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared in October. The stock triggered the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule in November and has been making new highs. Bank of America's 95 Composite is second best in the group. Shares of the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking giant have bounced off the 50-day line after consolidating sideways the past two months. They tripped the profit-taking rule in late November.Goldman Sachs (also 95), which entered the profit-taking zone in mid-November, also has found support at its 50-day moving average. It's now extended from a bounce off the line near 232.Proponents of Trump's delay action include the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade organization. ""ICI supports a delay in implementation of the current DOL fiduciary rule,"" ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens said in a statement. ""The Administration should use this time to address flaws in the rule and pursue a harmonized standard across the retail and retirement marketplace, coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure investors' best interests are paramount.""The Financial Planning Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, issued a statement saying it ""strongly opposes"" Trump's delay: ""By issuing this memorandum, the President is directing the Department of Labor to produce an outcome that will likely lead to either a complete gutting of this thoroughly vetted consumer protection or lead to its outright demise. Either one is a bad outcome for American retirement savers.""RELATED:Trump Orders Delay Of Labor Department Fiduciary RuleJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

194,MS,"No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is expected late Wednesday to report a third consecutive quarter of sales growth, as well as earnings that will re-accelerate after the company dipped into the red in Q3.Mylan's Q4 report will come amid a week chock full of health-sector earnings, including biotech Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) on Tuesday and eye-care firm Glaukos (GKOS) on Wednesday. Horizon Pharma (HZNP) and Perrigo (PRGO) are slated to report their Q4 earnings on Monday.For Q4, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Mylan to see $1.42 in earnings per share minus items on $3.18 billion in sales, up 16% and 28%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS fell 3% in Q3 after 11 quarters of growth.As part of its investor day in New York, Mylan will also issue guidance for 2017. Analysts currently view sales as growing 15% to $12.7 billion and EPS minus items up 12% to $5.33.Mylan stock is up 10% for the year, well above its 50-day moving average, after a rough 2016 that saw the stock tumble 29% as CEO Heather Bresch was forced to defend a bump in the price of its EpiPen two-pack to $600. Shares fell 0.4% Friday to 42.16.IBD'S TAKE: Glaukos filed its initial public offering in August 2015, and is among several stocks outperforming the S&P 500. Head to IBD's IPO Analysis for a deep dive on Glaukos and its fellow outperforming stocks.Before year's end, though, Mylan introduced its generic EpiPen at half the cost of the branded two-pack.Also late Wednesday, glaucoma and cataract surgery firm Glaukos is slated to report $29.8 billion in sales and break-even EPS ex items. Sales are expected to grow 47% year over year. The company lost 7 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.Glaukos stock hit a record high of 46.82 on Tuesday. Shares rose 2.9% Friday to 46.19.Late Tuesday, analysts expect Supernus to report 25 cents EPS ex items, up 79%, with revenue rising 36% to $59.5 million.Supernus stock fell 0.2% Friday to 25.30, after touching an all-time high of 27.95 at the start of the month.RELATED:Momenta, Pfizer Give Teva Breathing Room On Generic MS DrugAcorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect Ampyra: RBCTeva Dives To 10-Year Low After 4 Copaxone Patents Invalidated

195,MS,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. Sales shot up 55% last quarter.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

196,MS,"Bank stocks like Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) got a lift Tuesday after Fed Chair Janet Yellen appeared to leave open the possibility to a rate hike in March, suggested the economy is now at full employment, and warned waiting too long for a rate hike would be ""unwise.""But she said it's too early to know how the new administration's policies would play out and how they would affect the economy, according to prepared remarks for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.Yellen did, however, say that the unemployment rate was ""now in line"" with the median of Fed policymakers' ""estimates of its longer-run normal level."" Last month, Yellen said unemployment was near that level. That may signal the Fed will take a more hawkish stance to prevent the job market from overheating and stoking inflation.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.6% to 89.56 on the stock market today, hitting a record intraday high. Goldman Sachs rose 1.3% to 249.46, the highest since its all-time highset in 2007 and still within buy range from a 245.67 buy point. Bank of America (BAC), whose more U.S.-centric operations mean it stands to gain more from higher rates, climbed 2.8% to its best levels since late 2008.Citigroup (C) added 1.5%, after reclaiming support at its 50-day line a day earlier. Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 1.7%. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied 1.6% to 57.98, clearing a 57.43 buy point.Two-year and 10-year Treasury yields, which influence the value of different types of loans and offer a window into investors' inflation expectations, also rose.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks like JPMorgan, Goldman, Bank of America and Citigroup have risen on hopes President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress will cut regulations and taxes while also making a bigger push to improve U.S. infrastructure. Banks are among the few stocks that benefit when the Fed raises rates to keep borrowing and growth in check.  ""At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate,"" Yellen said in her written testimony.""As I noted on previous occasions,"" she later added, ""waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.""The remarks come after Fed policymakers opted earlier this month to leave target range for the federal funds rate unchanged. The central bank in December raised the rate — which determines interest charged on overnight loans banks make to one another meet the Fed's daily reserve requirements — and forecast three rate hikes this year, up from two.RELATED:JPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

197,MS,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) must keep its patents and stave off generic competition from Mylan (MYL), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Roxane to extend protection of its MS drug Ampyra out to 2026, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Tuesday.The biotech sued 10 companies over their plans to file generic versions of Ampyra, and is still awaiting a decision over whether it can keep any of its five patent protecting the drug. A decision is expected in the first case any day now. IPR could go until March 11.""If they lose either court case or IPR (inter partes review) case, then Ampyra could see generics enter in 2018, since (the) court case defines if generics are infringing and the IPR defines if they can even keep the patent,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Acorda stock jumped 6.5% to close at 25.40 on the stock market today, after toppling 2.3% on Tuesday.Acorda early Tuesday reported $140.6 million in sales for Q4, topping consensus views for $138.7 million and rising 7.4% vs. the year-earlier period. Acorda wrapped up the quarter with 5 cents earnings per share ex items, down 82% and missing views for 10 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is outperforming IBD's biotech group, up 23% year to date vs. a 10% rise in the 425-company industry group. Get some insight into Incyte's potential blockbusters via The New America.Much of the discussion during Acorda's earnings conference call with analysts centered on ongoing Ampyra litigation and whether to include Ampyra in 2017 models. For 2017, Acorda sees $535 million to $545 million in Ampyra sales.Acorda says the generic litigation with three remaining filers is ""too close to call,"" according to Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum. He sees 50/50 odds that Acorda will win its case against Teva, Mylan and Roxane. Acorda will adjust its 2017 view if its loses either court case.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich sees Acorda having a better than 50% chance of a positive outcome, but remained neutral on Acorda stock on Wednesday. The downside risk if he's wrong ""is simply too great,"" he wrote in a report.Still, there's some strength in Acorda's pipeline. Analysts broadly expect CVT-301, a Parkinson's drug, to be approved in 2018. Last week, Acorda unveiled good results from a phase 3 trial. Acorda plans to present more data on secondary endpoints in June.But Acorda's access to the migraine market could be limited with CVT-427 which, in a study of pharmacokinetics and pulmonary safety, showed reversible bronchoconstriction in smokers and asthmatics. CVT-427 could advance to phase 2 by year-end.Its label might shrink, though, Janney's Trbovich said. Excluding smokers and asthmatics could shrink Acorda's potential market by 20%.RELATED:Acorda Pops To 19-Week High On Strong Parkinson's Drug TrialAcorda Could Rival Lilly's 'Novel' Migraine Drug With Faster OnsetAcorda Scrapping Stroke Drug Just 'Small Disappointment': RBC

198,MS,"Dow components JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks fell Wednesday, testing key support as the 10-year Treasury yield continued its slide.However, the dip in bank stocks comes as analysts expect fatter payouts from banks in the era of President Trump.JPMorgan shares fell 0.9% to 85.96, while Bank of America (BAC) lost 1% to 22.67 and Wells Fargo (WFC) dropped 1.3% to close at 55.63 on the stock market today. Goldman dipped 0.6%. All of those stocks are off session lows as they found support near at their key 50-day lines.Morgan Stanley (MS) retreated 2.2% to 43.91, still maintaining a bit more distance from that line. Citigroup (C) slid 1.5% to 56.32, treading below its 50-day line since January.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell five basis points to 2.35%, near their lowest levels of the year and extending a slide on Monday and Tuesday.The 10-year Treasury yield influences the rate on mortgages and other types of debt, and has eased off highs reached in December. Wider yield spreads between short- and long-term rates boost banks' net interest margins.Yields rise when expectations of inflation and economic growth increase.Bond yields surged after President Trump's election, with investors betting that tax cuts, infrastructure investments, and a shearing away of regulations would cause the economy to heat up, push up wages and prices, and force the Fed to hike rates more frequently to keep growth in check.Banks and other financial stocks got yet another lift last week after Trump took executive action ordering a review of the Dodd-Frank post-crisis financial-reform measures — although any changes would have to come from Congress. He also ordered halt to a rule, set to take hold in April, that would require retirement advisors put their clients' needs above others on the job.Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck, in a research note on Monday, said an easing of regulatory pressure could also help open the taps for banks' capital return plans.Morgan Stanley said that due to a less stressful round of stress tests — the annual evaluation of U.S. banks' ability to keep lending and operating amid potential convulsions to the economy — dividends from the banks it covers could rise 8% and gross buybacks 40% from the third quarter of this year to Q2 of next year.Graseck added that ""we expect buybacks will increase over next several CCAR cycles, along with more capital allocated to lending and banking activities.""IBD'S TAKE: Even though banks have leveled off from their postelection surge, they're still among the only stocks to benefit from higher interest rates. CCAR refers to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, which assesses banks' capital levels and the soundness of banks' capital planning, including shareholder returns. The other test is known as the Dodd-Frank stress test, which evaluates whether banks have enough of a financial cushion to withstand a shock to the system.The guidelines for the latest stress tests, released Friday, exempt 21 banks from the portion of the tests that evaluates their capital plans. This year's ""severely adverse scenario"" for the tests also excludes negative short-term Treasury rates.She estimates that the banks she covers have some $120 billion in ""excess capital,"" led by $29.1 billion held by Citigroup. Bank of America had $21.2 billion in excess capital, while JPMorgan had $19.7 billion.While any changes to Dodd-Frank might not occur until next year, Morgan Stanley said it believed ""significant change on the enforcement of existing regulations can come from the new agency heads who are likely to be appointed over the next 18 months.""A new vice chair of supervision at the Fed ""could drive a more quantitatively oriented approval process to the stress test,"" the firm noted.Results from the stress tests will likely be released closer to the summer.RELATED:U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

201,MS,"Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) stock jumped Monday after the drugmaker torched Wall Street's Q4 expectations and maintained 2017 guidance despite the loss of four patents protecting MS drug Copaxone in January.In the stock market today, Teva stock ended the day up 5.6% to 34. But shares toppled 3.1% on Jan. 31, after a U.S. District Court invalidated four of five patents protecting Copaxone, opening Teva up to potential generic competition in multiple sclerosis.The stock has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages for nearly six months amid allegations of price fixing among generic drugmakers and amid expectations the government will take actions to combat sometimes-soaring drug prices.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 14, out of a best-possible 99, meaning it trails eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics like sales performance. Head to IBD'S Stock Checkup for better-rated rivals.For Q4, Teva reported $6.5 billion in sales and $1.38 earnings per share ex items, up 33% and 7.8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both figures topped the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $6.2 billion and $1.35.MS drug Copaxone brought in $829 million in Q4 sales in the U.S., beating consensus views for $815 million and growing 9.1% vs. the year-ago period. International sales, though, fell 7% year over year to $186 million.Generics medicines comprised 71% of Teva's Q4 sales, growing 44% year over year. A 62% increase in ROW revenues to $1.3 billion helped the generic unit. Analysts had expected $3.32 billion in generics sales in Q4. But that estimate didn't include $412 million from the over the counter unit.""So there was not really a beat in this segment,"" Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in a note to clients. She has an underperform rating but just a 27 price target on Teva stock.Teva maintained its 2017 guidance for $23.8 billion to $$24.5 billion in sales and $4.90-$5.30 EPS ex items, which would be up 10% and flat, respectively. Analysts are modeling $23.6 billion and $4.80.RELATED:Teva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock DivesTeva Dives To 10-Year Low After 4 Copaxone Patents InvalidatedLilly Regains Key Migraine Drug With $960 Million CoLucid Acquisition

202,MS,"U.S. stocks advanced Monday morning with several breakouts adding some spice to the mix.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.4%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq.Bank stocks woke from their recent slumber as the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index advanced more than 1%, clearing a recent consolidation. Several banks showed excellent price-and-volume action.Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) broke out of a flat base in strong volume. The stock gapped up 2%, thrusting above a 50.82 buy point. Western Alliance is in IBD's Sector Leaders screen, which is the toughest screen IBD has. Western's 5% buy zone extends to 53.36.Seacoast Banking (SBCF) gapped up 8% as it broke out of a flat base. The ideal buy point was 23.10, but that was not actionable because of the gap up. The open price of 23.60 serves as the realistic entry.Morgan Stanley (MS) tacked on 1.5% in heavy volume, padding a recent breakout.Blue chips were mostly up. In the Dow Jones industrial average, Caterpillar (CAT) broke out, retaking a 97.50 buy point in heavy volume. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), another Dow component, poked to a new high in volume about 20% above average.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, steel stocks, automakers and superregional banks posted strong daily gains.

205,MS,"Shares of financial institutions — ranging from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Charles Schwab (SCHW) — jumped as President Trump signed executive orders ordering a review of Dodd-Frank regulations as well as a halt to a rule that would require some retirement advisors to put their clients' needs over the bottom line.The bank rally pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average back over 20,000 Friday. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs (GS) are part of the Dow industrials.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other business leaders including the heads of BlackRock (BLK), Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) also met Trump at the White House to discuss tax policy, trade, infrastructure and women in the workplace.Trump signed an order directing government agencies to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank overhaul put in place after the financial crisis. He also requested a pause to the fiduciary rule, set to take effect in April.Shares of JPMorgan rose 3.1% on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.5%, Citigroup (C) added 3.2%.Investment banks were big winners, with a possible ban on proprietary trading among the possible Dodd-Frank provisions that could be rethought: Morgan Stanley (MS) jumped 5.5% and Goldman Sachs rallied 4.6%, both gapping above their 50-day lines.Charles Schwab added 2.55%, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) gained 1.5% and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) rose 1.1%. All three online brokerages fell sharply Thursday after Schwab slashed stock trading commission fees.Even as the Trump administration stacks its ranks with Goldman Sachs (GS) alumni, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a Wall Street Journal article early Friday that the moves had less to do with helping banks and more to do ""with being a player in a global market where we should, could and will have a dominant position as long as we don't regulate ourselves out of that.""Cohn said Dodd-Frank constrains lending and the scope of financial products that banks could offer, while the fiduciary rule restricts consumer options. He also argued that regulations put in place after the housing bust were ineffective.IBD'S TAKE: With financial-management rules likely to change, read this story for more information about the best online brokers this year. Despite the Dodd-Frank criticisms, Trump's regulatory rollback comes after U.S. banks have scooped up market share in Europe as lenders there still try to regain composure after the financial crisis. And Citigroup last year said Mexico had ""tremendous untapped potential,"" setting its sights on Asia as well. But some analysts have expressed concern that trade restrictions could hurt banks' operations in Mexico.After the election, bank stocks soared on deregulation hopes and expectations that faster economic growth would spur wider yield spreads due to higher inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes. Bank stocks have traded flat to slightly down in 2017, though.Cohn said the White House could try to install a new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and added that the Treasury Department would try to make sweeping changes at mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).RELATED:Banks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

207,MS,"Time magazine has singled out White House strategist Steve Bannon for its Darth Vader cover treatment. Shown is a picture of Bannon looking like a Marvel Comics villain and the title ""The Great Manipulator."" Bannon dared to identify the liberal media as ""the opposition party."" Time took offense and demonstrably proved him right.Demonizing the president's aides is something Time and its liberal ilk have not done to Democrats since the days of President Jimmy Carter, when Time was liberal but not nearly as leftist as it is today. At this point eight years ago, the same magazine was profiling President Obama's aide Larry Summers as the ""brash and brilliant economic advisor,"" the ""economic wunderkind ... moving at flank speed"" who speaks with ""an almost poetic clarity.""Obama was always center stage. No evil wizard manipulated him from behind the curtains. That only happens under apparently ""manipulated"" dolts like President Reagan, President George W. Bush and now, President Trump.The new article is headlined ""The second most powerful man in the world? Steve Bannon has the President's ear. But he wants more."" For Trump, Bannon is ""a director who deploys ravenous sharks, shrieking tornadoes and mushroom clouds as reliably as John Ford shot Monument Valley.""Decades ago, Time shredded the notion that it is a news magazine, steadily becoming evermore politicized. It's a badly disguised journal of rampaging liberal opinion. But it is a stubborn pretender. It insists that its brand of liberal advocacy passes as acceptably objective inside today's news business, and it's right, of course.Time managing editor Nancy Gibbs unfurled a nasty gram at Bannon in her ""From the Editor"" letter up front. She cited Bannon's ""opposition party"" comment and then spat, ""To demonize the press, to characterize it as not just mistaken but malign, is to lay the groundwork for repression.""These people dish out criticism, but wow, are they incapable of taking it. Criticize Trump, and you are Honorable Dissent. Criticize the media, and you are Nazi Dictatorship.Gibbs thinks her magazine is serenely centrist and objective, which makes her a fool. Lest anyone take offense, consider the alternative: If not a fool, she'd be a raging liar. She boasts: ""At a time when the media is ever more fractured and siloed, and much of it partisan on both sides, TIME is one of the few remaining institutions that speaks to a broad and global audience. ... Our purpose is not to tell people what to think; it is to help them decide what to think about.""Someone should please make an appointment to meet with Ms. Gibbs for two minutes and simply show her the Time cover of Trump's face melting, and the cover of Trump's face melting into a puddle. Is one not to conclude a wee bit of hostility toward Trump? How traumatically gullible does Time think America is?This kind of bloviation is especially nonsensical coming from Gibbs. Take her valentine to Obama after his first victory. She placed him on par with Christ, saying: ""Some princes are born in palaces. Some are born in mangers. But a few are born in the imagination, out of scraps of history and hope."" What a bottle of ipecac.Then there's Gibbs on President Bill Clinton during the Monicagate scandal. She said: ""In the gaudy mansion of Clinton's mind there are many rooms with heavy doors, workrooms and playrooms, rooms stuffed with trophies, rooms to stash scandals and regrets. He walks lightly amid the ironies of his talents and behavior, just by consigning them to different cubbies of his brain. It's an almost scary mind, that of a multitasking wizard.""Put a cork in it. The jig has been up for 30 years. No one's buying the outraged protests of nonpartisanship. What Time is claiming to be news is the very definition of fake news.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.RELATED:The Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream MediaMedia Misreport Gallup Poll Results About Trump's AbilitiesGot Fake News?

209,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said on Wednesday that it will provide custody and fund services for more than $1 trillion in client assets from asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), a deal the bank described as one of the largest of its kind.BlackRock will be moving those services to JPMorgan from State Street (STT) in attempt to cut clients' costs, according to Bloomberg.JPMorgan said it would likely onboard those assets over the next two years. The bank's custody services include settling and holding onto clients' securities for safety purposes. It also provides accounting services and administration for funds.The deal with BlackRock comes after more recent investments in its custody banking business. JPMorgan said business done with its custody clients had grown by 10% over the past 12 months.JPMorgan shares gained 1.55% to 86.03 in the stock market today, continuing a rebound off its 50-day line as the broader market and bond yields rally.State Street, which also reported weaker-than-expected earnings Wednesday, fell 3.4% to 77.80, below its 50-day line. State Street sank as low as 74.45 intraday.BlackRock rose 1.8%, accelerating off support found in recent days at its own 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: BlackRock's deal with JPMorgan comes as many financial institutions seek to cut costs, often turning to technology to do so. Blockchain, one such technology, could save banks billions in the years to come. Bank stocks have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the so-called Trump rally, on hopes the new president and a GOP-controlled Congress would scale back regulations and grow the economy faster, leading to higher interest rates.Bank shares overall, however, have eased from their postelection run amid uncertainty of how any new policies might play out as they make their way through Congress. But, like JPMorgan, other banking giants shined Wednesday.Bank of America (BAC) shares rose 2% intraday, Citigroup (C) added 1.9%, and Wells Fargo (WFC) climbed 3.9%. Investment banking giants Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) edged up 1.4% and 2.6% respectively.RELATED:JPMorgan Cautious On Benefits From Tax Cuts, Fewer RegulationsWells Fargo To More Than Double Branch Closures In 2017; More In 2018

The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges compared with the same time Tuesday.Strength in the day's indexes initially had a chip-and-banks tilt. The Philadelphia semiconductor index popped 1.2%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index initially gained 0.9% but then reversed to a 0.3% loss.In the SOX index, the big gainers were Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), up 15%; Cirrus Logic (CRUS), up 4%; and Marvell Technology (MRVL), up 2%.Advanced Micro Devices topped the Street's estimates on revenue and earnings. Revenue increased 15%, and the adjusted loss of a penny a share was better than expected. Former hedge fund manager and CNBC financial commentator Jim Cramer called Advanced Micro a buy and said the company has ""the hot gaming chips.""Advanced Micro is a low-priced stock but has some quality fund support.

Morgan Stanley (MS) and KeyCorp (KEY) rose 0.4% and 0.3% respectively.

212,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS), which helped send the Dow Jones industrial average above 20,000 last week, fell below its 50-day line and secondary buy point Tuesday, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are testing their 50-day averages amid a market sell-off and concerns on global trade under the Trump administration.Bank stocks surged immediately after the election on hopes for higher interest rates, lighter regulations and faster economic growth. They leveled off in early December but picked up some momentum last week as positive earnings reports lifted investor sentiment. But Goldman shares tumbled 2% to 229.32 on the stock market today, as bond yields also fell, weighing on rates that banks charge on certain balances. The stock tested its 50-day line last week, then bounced higher, representing a follow-on entry point.JPMorgan lost 1.6% and Morgan Stanley 1.5% as they neared their 50-day lines. Bank of America (BAC) shares slid 1.35%, still comfortably above their 50-day.Citigroup (C) shares were off 1.4% to 55.83, falling further below its 50-day. The bank is especially exposed to international markets, which were shaken after President Donald Trump announced his travel ban on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Citi also announced Tuesday that it would merge its media and telecom investment banking units.More U.S.-focused lenders like Wells Fargo (WFC) were less affected, though hopes are fading for a massive infrastructure-spending bill, and the growth hopes that would've come with it, as Democrats in Congress take a harder line against cooperating with Trump amid the travel ban backlash.Shares of Wells Fargo ticked up 0.45% on Tuesday.RELATED: Fed Preview: Policymakers Can't Figure Out Trump, So They Won't TryBreakout Watch: This Bank Stock Outranks BofA, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan

213,MS,"In early December, many individual investors were kicking themselves for missing the big gains in the bank sector. Such investors were wishing the bank stocks in the Big Cap 20 would pause just enough to offer a secondary entry. Well, wishes come true but seldom in the neat package investors desire. Right now, many bank stocks have returned to the…

214,MS,"The postelection rally in corporate credit could stage a sharp reversal, warn analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS).Corporate credit's been on a tear since Trump's victory, as his proposed policies have fueled an upward shift in U.S. growth projections and interest rates. Now the investment bank is arguing that tighter financial conditions in the form of rising interest rates and a stronger dollar, along with high leverage, will conspire to gate-crash the party.They've looked at the positive market signals — inflows to bond funds, projections for lower default rates, and an uptick in estimates for corporate earnings — and found them to be overhyped.While investors are betting that the rally in junk bonds still has juice, even as the asset class delivered double-digit returns in 2016, fixed-income analysts led by Adam Richmond argue that investors should reduce the credit risk of their portfolios and move back into high-quality government bonds.Investors are restating bearish projections issued at the end of November, when they forecast that high-yield bonds would post a total return of minus-2.7% for 2017.Since then markets have thrown caution to the wind with credit spreads rallying even as rising rates on higher-quality fixed income assets have, in theory, diminished the need to dive lower into the credit spectrum for yield. It's a rush to risk that's akin to the stock market rally, where earnings optimism has trumped a higher discount rate.""Higher Treasury yields in an environment of high leverage have to matter at some point,"" the analysts wrote in a Jan. 6 note. Here are their five reasons for caution:Strong growth doesn't equal higher returns: Monetary conditions are more important for credit markets than ""modestly better"" growth, they say. With fiscal stimulus projected to kick in relatively late in the economic cycle and the labor market near full employment, tighter financial conditions — strong dollar, high rates — will offset the growth boost from looser budgetary policies, the analysts note.Meanwhile, structural headwinds, such as heavy debt burdens and an aging population, loom large. ""We think that the Fed withdrawing liquidity matters more than an extra couple of tenths of a percent on GDP growth, and creates an environment where negative catalysts will be magnified,'' they write.The cycle is foreboding: The credit rally is in its late stages while valuations are rich, setting the stage for a fall in bond prices as the Federal Reserve tightens.""Remember, the Fed is not beginning to withdraw liquidity early in a cycle, when the economy is booming, earnings growth is strong, and corporate balance sheet quality is pristine. These hikes are coming in the eighth year of an expansion, with growth sub-2%, leverage at record levels, and when markets have been arguably more dependent than ever on that central bank support,"" the analysts say.""As we have seen over the course of this cycle, withdrawing liquidity in this environment means mistakes are more likely, negative catalysts are magnified, and, with valuations at current levels, there is a much smaller margin of error,"" they add.Lower default risks don't translate to spread tightening: Credit markets are forward-looking and spreads in a given year reflect, in part, the change in projections for defaults in the following year, the bank argues.If defaults stage an uptick in 2018, markets may price in that prospect in the second half of the year, placing pressure on spreads. With U.S. corporate leverage at a record high on some metrics, default risks are set to spread beyond the energy sector.Higher earnings can't mask declining fundamentals: It's unlikely that earnings growth can materially improve corporate balance sheets given high absolute debt burdens and rising rates. Meanwhile, the incentives for firms to continue gorging on debt are high amid expanding U.S. output — a negative cocktail for spreads.""Expecting companies to de-lever balance sheets in an environment where growth and animal spirits are both improving is wishful thinking, in our view,"" the analysts say. ""At least that's not how it usually works.""Strong flows don't necessarily presage spread tightening: Counter-intuitively, even if credit markets see decent inflows — defying projections of a great rotation out of fixed-income funds in favor of equities — there's no guarantee that spreads will tighten, since the former often represents a lagging indicator for where the market is headed, the analysts caution.In short, strong flows usually tell you that spreads have tightened, not that spreads will tighten.

215,MS,"Without an iota of doubt, the folks at Fidelity know equity and bond markets.The Boston-based money manager has decades of experience on ""the buy side."" That is, Fidelity's mutual fund managers and fleet of mutual funds have accumulated an enviable depth of knowledge in researching, buying and selling financial securities. It has done a staggering amount of business with major securities dealers on Wall Street that represent ""the sell side.""So is it any surprise to investors that Fidelity has capitalized on its unique history to also become one of the most respected players in the online brokerage field — so much so that in 2017, its clients participating in a major IBD survey gave it the highest Overall Customer Experience index rating for a third year in a row?Likely no. But talk to Ram Subramaniam, the head of Fidelity Investments' retail brokerage business, and you get the sense that it is hungry to stay atop the heap for years to come.""We strongly believe in customer value, and 2016 was another banner year for Fidelity to bring a better customer experience,"" Subramaniam, who joined Fidelity after stints in wealth management at Morgan Stanley (MS) and brokerage operations at Fidelity rival TD Ameritrade (AMTD), told IBD.The 2017 IBD Best Online Brokers standings are based on an annual survey of thousands of investors by Investor's Business Daily and polling partner TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence. The investors were asked to rate their experience with their primary online broker on 13 important service areas. (See a full explanation in our article on the best brokers survey methodology.)Besides nabbing the top score in Overall Customer Experience, Fidelity held on to the top rung in four of the 13 categories — research tools, portfolio analysis and reports, investment research and educational resources. Plus, it garnered the highest rating in a new category, investment and retirement planning tools.And Fidelity received the second-highest score in all eight of the other categories, spanning from ETF choices to trade reliability to mobile trading platforms.One of the best examples of how Fidelity's vast knowledge of the capital markets translates into better value for its retail customers is perhaps its price improvement feature on all equity trades. Based on an independent study commissioned by Fidelity, over a 12-month period through November 2016, the average discount on equity trades involving a minimum 1,000 shares was $10.97 for Fidelity customers vs. average savings of just $1.90 per trade industrywide in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2016.That savings represents a better buy price than the national market system's best offer and a better sell price than the national best bid price at the time of the order. The average price improvement is also larger than the $7.95 that Fidelity charges for each equity order. How does Fidelity pull this off?According to Subramaniam, Fidelity has a capital markets group that specializes in order execution, and it actively seeks the best venues for executing customer trades. ""We try to create competition among market makers,"" he said. ""We take a lot of pride in that price improvement work.""A Fidelity investor, upon logging in, can easily track these trade execution savings on a month-to-date and year-to-date basis.Here are other milestones that Fidelity hit in 2016 in its drive to be the No. 1 destination for retail investors:More incentives to save for retirement: For customers who open a new IRA, Fidelity matches contributions of up to $1,950 each year for three years, and the reason is simple. ""We'd like people to save more for retirement,"" Subramaniam said.Fidelity also now offers a Visa credit card with no annual fee and a 2% cash-back reward for all purchases. Subramaniam says that a family that spends between $30,000 to $40,000 per year can generate $800 in cash back each year, enough money over time to pay a good deal of a child's college tuition costs for a year.More commission-free investment vehicles: 91 ETFs are now commission-free, triple the number from four to five years ago. They include all 18 core iShares ETFs. Fidelity also offers 3,600 mutual funds with zero transaction fees.More mobile services: Subramaniam says that the number of check deposits made by simply taking a smartphone snapshot of the check has jumped 250% over the past three years.A completely overhauled research section: Its web pages are now fully responsive to the type of internet-enabled device being used, and contain more relevant data on specific stocks in a customer's account. Subramaniam calls it ""personalized data."" He adds, ""It's really about driving well-informed decisions by the customer.""Lower bond commissions: According to Subramaniam, a study found that Fidelity can help customers save as much as $14 for every bond with a $1,000 face value traded. So a buyer of $100,000 worth of corporate debt can save as much as $1,400 in transaction fees.More robust ETF screening: Last year, Fidelity debuted a thematic ETF screener, allowing customers to search exchange traded funds by category, such as international and fixed income.A more useful platform for active traders: Fidelity enhanced its active trading platform's dashboard so that a user can quickly spot key macroeconomic news and a heat map to spot unusual buying and selling across various industries and sectors in the equity markets.Fidelity engaged with a group of active traders to co-create, test and improve the platform. It also launched a ""strategy desk"" in which customers can call in to receive one-on-one or one-to-many coaching on advanced trading such as options.One more way that a retail customer benefits by having a Fidelity account is the immediate access to perspectives from Fidelity's seasoned team of money managers — or the buy side.In the Jan. 4 article ""Bonds 2017: A New Dynamic,"" found in the Investing Ideas section of ""Fidelity Viewpoints,"" Ford O'Neil, who manages the Fidelity Total Bond Fund (FTBFX), singles out the financial and energy sectors as investing opportunities in the corporate bond space. Why?He, like many Wall Street observers, sees the new Donald Trump administration as likely to take away some of the burdensome and costly regulations placed on companies in both fields during the eight-year term of former President Obama.""Many companies have told me that regulatory burdens are among the largest challenges they've had to deal with in the last eight years,"" O'Neil was quoted as saying. O'Neil is not related to William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman.O'Neil stresses caution in agency mortgage-backed securities because they ""are trading at valuations that are closer to Treasuries than what is typically seen. In other words, the yield spread between these two categories of bonds has tightened,"" according to the article.A potential rise in inflation is a key theme for 2017. O'Neil suggests not just TIPS (Treasury inflation-protected securities) but also floating-rate loans, while holding credit risk, offer relatively high yields and could counter the effects of higher prices.""If the Fed raises rates more aggressively than expected, floating-rate loans probably won't be hurt as much as traditional bonds because floating rate payments are indexed to interest rate levels,"" Fidelity wrote.RELATED:Great Stockbrokers Of The 20th Century I: Meet Former E.F.

216,MS,"Early Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) sidestepped Q4 and 2016 sales misses on ""better than feared"" 2017 guidance in the wake of its hemophilia spinoff — prodding shares to rebound from a three-day slump.Biogen stock closed up 2.1% at 278.89 on the stock market today, after its Q4 earnings release. Shares have continued to trade below their 50-day moving average but have bumped up to their 200-day line.On its face, Biogen's 2017 guidance appeared to have missed. Biogen sees $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion in sales and $20.45-$21.25 earnings per share ex items. The consensus modeled $12.1 billion and $21.02. But some analyst estimates likely included hemophilia sales.Biogen's hemophilia unit will be spun off into Bioverativ on Feb. 1. The unit includes the Eloctate and Alprolix drugs, which brought in $847 million in sales in 2016, up 53%.""If you delete the estimated $813 million in hemophilia revenues (for the final 11 months of 2017), Biogen's 2017 top-line guidance seems to be in line,"" Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research report. ""We get roughly $1 EPS contribution from the hemophilia business. So ... the 2017 EPS guide looks good to us.""IBD'S TAKE: Among the top five biotech leaders, RBC expected Biogen and Amgen to lead the sector, as Gilead struggles with slowing hepatitis C sales. Get the deeper dive on Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals on IBD's Industry Themes.For Q4, Biogen reported $2.87 billion in sales and $5.04 EPS minus items, up 1.2% and 12%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Though EPS topped analysts' view for $4.96, sales narrowly missed the $2.94 billion expectation.Schoenebaum blamed the miss on soft Tysabri and interferon sales, and Tecfidera sales that were just in line. Multiple sclerosis drug Zinbryta brought in $6 million, growing from $2 million in the year-earlier quarter. But that disappointed, he noted.The bear case for Biogen figures on uncertainty following the launch of Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug in conjunction with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), pricing issues in the MS market including payor pushback, and coming MS competition from Roche, RBC analyst Michael Yee says.For 2016, Biogen reported 6% sales growth to $11.4 billion, missing analyst views for $11.52 billion. Biogen's $20.22 EPS ex items grew 19% and topped views for $20.17.RELATED:Gilead, Merck, Alexion 2017 Views Hazy; Biogen May Surge: AnalystMerck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Drug Approvals Despite FDA SlumpBiogen Pays Forward Pharma $1.25 Billion To Settle Tecfidera Suit

217,MS,"Stocks reacted relatively calmly to a U.S. fourth-quarter GDP report that missed the Street's consensus view on Friday and appeared set to finish the week with decent gains.The first reading of 1.9% growth fell short of the 2.2% growth view, and some economists polled by Econoday expected an even much bigger increase, as high as 3.3%. However, prices rose an expected 2.1%, which is good news for banks and the Federal Reserve, whose monetary policy hinges on a 2% minimum inflation target. GDP grew 1.6% in all of 2016, down from a 2.2% jump in 2015.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) looks set to post a solid weekly gain and a fourth week up in a row. The mega-cap tech remains in buy range from a recent breakout price of 118.12. Notice on its weekly chart how the relative strength line, displayed in blue in IBD charts, has been steadily rising in the past two months, a sign of market outperformance.The RS line compares a stock's day-to-day performance against the S&P 500. So, even if a stock falls in price, if the S&P 500 falls more, then the stock's RS line rises. The 5% permissible buy range in Apple, which now has a $649 billion market value, goes up to 124.03.The Nasdaq composite snuffed out virtually negligible early losses and was fractionally higher with one hour to go in the trading session. The Nasdaq 100, reflecting strength in the semiconductor sector, edged up nearly 0.2%.The S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower, and the Russell 2000 fell nearly 0.4%. The latter was down nearly 0.7% during a morning sell-off.The Dow Jones industrial average were essentially flat, but a few of its top guns were cooling off. Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped 1.2% to 236.75, halting a five-day rally, but shares are holding nicely above the key 50-day moving average.In 2016, earlier stories in Stock Market Today and IBD's The Big Picture had featured numerous Wall Street banks, including Goldman, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of Montreal (BMO), as they were clearing buy points in long bottoming-base patterns. BMO traded quietly Friday and is up sharply since clearing a 67.79 flat-base entry on Dec. 6.Among IBD's 197 industry groups tracked each day, big declines by solar, department store, oil drilling, homebuilding and airline stocks offset gains in the metal products distribution, diversified operations, chip gear, gaming and medical products stocks.Going back to Apple, one should simply not expect the company to make the sort of high-octane run that it accomplished throughout many periods within the 2004 to 2007 bull market era. Growth was running at high double-digit to triple-digit clips back then. Not anymore. Apple's net income is still huge, but earnings per share fell 18%, 23% and 15% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. The Street sees fiscal Q1 profit down 2% to $3.22 a share.Q1 results are due Tuesday after the close.The company, which reportedly no longer has the top-selling smartphone in China, is wrestling with the challenge of creating game-changing new products and the law of large numbers.Sales in the fiscal year that ended in September 2004 totaled $8.3 billion, up 33% vs. FY 2003. Twelve years later in FY 2016, Apple's total sales slipped 8% to $215.6 billion. That was Apple's first year-over-year annual decline since FY 2001.However, revenue is expected to rebound in the next two quarters (up 2% to $77.4 billion in Q1, which ended in December last year, and up 6.9% to $54.0 billion in Q2).Apple could also emerge as a top growth and income play. Its annualized dividend yield of 1.9% is virtually in lock step with the S&P 500, but more importantly, William O'Neil + Co. calculates the long-term growth in Apple's dividend at a robust 29%.RELATED:The Bottoming Base, Part 1: Why It Helps Traders Make Money In StocksThe Bottoming Base, Part 2: How Apple Formed One In 2009Stock Market Today: Maxim Integrated Surges, Featured In The Income Investor Throughout 2016Stock Market Today: Why Tesla Motors Now Deserves A Spot On Your Watch List

218,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS), Wall Street's biggest stock-trading firm by revenue, is cutting its global bonus pool for the equities division by as much as 4% and dismissing some employees after the industry's results flagged last year, according to people with knowledge of the plans.The firm, which is set to pay annual bonuses next month, has been fine-tuning calculations for pay packages since November, according to the people, who asked not to be identified describing the deliberations. Traders and salespeople across the investment bank were terminated this week as part of an annual performance review, the people said.Wall Street firms that have been cost-cutting to improve profits in the wake of the financial crisis are set to focus on equities personnel after new issuances decreased in 2016. Stock traders and salespeople around the world may see compensation for the year fall 9%, the first drop since 2012, according to a November report from recruiting firm Options Group. Meanwhile, fixed-income personnel should see the first increase since 2012 after political events set off a frenzy of transactions, according to the report.Morgan Stanley's equities revenue dropped 3.5% to $6.08 billion in the first nine months of 2016. Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) all suffered declines of 12% to 14% in that business, while the biggest European investment banks all reported decreases of more than 20% on a dollar basis. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) posted the smallest drop, about 1%.Bank of America set aside about 5% less for equities traders' bonuses, as fees have dwindled along with a decline in stock issuances, people with knowledge of the matter said. The decline also reflects the impact of fewer employees in the business, the people said.""Morgan Stanley and other U.S. banks can afford to cut bonuses, since they face reduced competition thanks to European banks being lame ducks due to European regulations on bonuses,"" said Jason Kennedy, chief executive officer of recruitment firm Kennedy Group in London.Morgan Stanley cut compensation costs at its investment banking and trading unit by 11% in the first nine months of 2016, as revenue dropped 12%. The firm is set to announce its full-year pay expenses later this month.Ted Pick, who led Morgan Stanley's equities business to the top spot in the years after the financial crisis, was put in charge of all the company's trading in October 2015. Last year, Pick tapped stock-trading executive Sam Kellie-Smith to help turn around the firm's fixed-income unit, while Peter Santoro was elevated to head of equity trading.

The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average held up better, each shaving off 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher on both major exchanges.Small caps and bank stocks have been two hot areas in the postelection rally. However, they came in for some apparent profit-taking today. Meanwhile, some blue chips were holding up well.Home Depot (HD), a Dow Jones industrial average component, popped 1.27 to 136.31. The stock has shaped a saucer with handle with a potential buy point at 137.42. The pattern is first stage, which is more likely to work than later bases.Home Depot's fiscal year ends in January. The Street expects 2017 earnings to rise 18%, which represents an upward revision. Q4 results will be released Feb. 21.Procter & Gamble (PG), another Dow component, advanced 1.21 to 85.22 in brisk volume. The megacap retook its 50-day and 200-day lines. Procter & Gamble is working on a flat base but has some work to do on the right side of its pattern. The base is first stage.In the S&P 500, superregional bank Comerica (CMA) took the hardest hit, gapping down 3.83 to 66.09. Volume was heavy. The company reported quarterly results, topping the earnings target by about 14%. Revenue was lower than expected.IBD'S TAKE: Don't ignore tobacco stocks. Two have outperformed the major indexes for three years in a row.Morgan Stanley (MS) also reported. The money center beat the Street's consensus estimate by about 25%.

220,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS) said it's too soon to say what trading activity will be like this year after reporting much-better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on strong bond trades.CFO Harvey Schwartz told analysts that confidence is the best stimulus for client activity and that the latter half of last year saw a surge in client confidence.""With the shifting policies around the globe, it's an extraordinary catalyst for client dialogue, for decision making and for content,"" he said.As the Federal Reserve looks to increase rates three times this year, Goldman stands to gain further, with Schwartz predicting ""meaningful upside"" in fixed income, commodities and currency trading if rate continue rising.In Q4, earnings per share quadrupled to $5.08, easily beating views for $4.82, after a mortgage-securities settlement a year earlier gouged earnings. Revenue jumped 12% to $8.17 billion. Fixed income, currency, and commodities trading revenue soared 78% to $2 billion.Shares fell 0.6% to 234.29 on the stock market today. Citigroup (C), which also reported earnings and strong bond-trading revenue, fell 1.7%. Rival investment banking giant Morgan Stanley (MS), whose fourth-quarter results on Tuesday topped views, rose 1.7%.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged up 0.5%, and Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.6%. Those companies reported earnings last week, as trading revenue surged. Wells Fargo (WFC), which will accelerate its branch closures this year and next, added 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are likely to close more branches as they try to cut costs and as more people manage their finances over their phones. Other forms of technology, like blockchain, could help the industry save billions.After a steep climb following the election of Donald Trump and the prospect of looser regulations, job growth, inflation and higher interest rates, bank stocks appear to have taken a breather in recent weeks.Bank stocks seem likely to cool down further amid signs that Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress don't agree on a key piece of hoped-for tax cuts, adding doubts to a major postelection driver of bank stocks.

221,MS,"Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) — the latter of which topped Q4 forecasts Tuesday morning — and other banks fell after President-elect Donald Trump signaled opposition to a key piece of the GOP's tax strategy, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, threatening hopes for anticipated tax cuts.The slide comes as investors wait for more clarity on what Trump's plans might actually look like after they get batted around in Congress. Such policy details, Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby noted, might not begin to surface until the second half of the year.""You're getting more disconnect between what different Republicans want,"" he said.Lower bond yields also weighed Tuesday, and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's speech indicating a so-called ""hard Brexit"" to separate the country from the EU added to uncertainty over London's future as a banking hub.Even as Morgan Stanley solidly beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, the outlook for the industry has continued to overshadow its actual results.""These earnings are trivial in relation to the perception that's driving the stocks right now,"" Mosby said.Shares of Morgan Stanley closed down 3.8% to 42.15 on the stock market today. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup (C), which report Wednesday, were down 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America, which reported earnings last week, fell 3.6% and 4.2%. Wells Fargo (WFC), which also reported last week and plans to more than double its branch closures this year, fell 2.8%.Bank stocks initially took off after the election on hopes the incoming administration and GOP-controlled Congress will cut regulations, grow the economy and create a higher-interest-rate environment. But the sector began to level off last month as the rise in bond yields have slowed.JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo shares are approaching their fast-rising 50-day lines for the first time in months, as the 10-year Treasury yield threatens to close below that key level. Superregional bank Comerica (CMA), which also reported better-than-expected earnings early Tuesday, tumbled 6.5% as it tested its 50-day line.Analysts have said the sector could fall more amid uncertainty over how new policy details shake out.

The government's December jobs report is set for release on Friday.Bank stock charts generally look healthy, with share prices leveling off in recent weeks following a long run-up after the election of Donald Trump. Wall Street has been betting that a combination of tax cuts, regulatory cutbacks, an infrastructure overhaul and higher inflation under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will benefit banks in the years to come.The economic growth and infrastructure investment have led to anticipation of higher inflation, which has pushed longer-term yields up as investors try to make up for the dollar's declining buying power over time. When the Fed raises rates, a prospect more likely under higher inflation, banks can more easily raise their own, helping to pad their finances.The Federal Reserve has already offered more bullish signals on rate hikes for this year. According to minutes from the Fed's December meeting, policymakers ""indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years.""IBD'S TAKE: The Fed can raise its own benchmark interest rate in an attempt to curb inflation and economic overexpansion and make borrowing more expensive. With investors banking on Trump's fiscal policy jolting the economy, Fed policymakers may get more aggressive on raising rates. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo report quarterly earnings next week.RELATED:More Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-MartAs The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The WayU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

245,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to cool expectations Friday for a bonanza from the GOP Congress and incoming Trump administration on anticipated tax cuts and deregulation.The No. 1 U.S. bank by assets and market share also topped Q4 estimates, helped by a surge in trading revenue, while rival Bank of America (BAC) missed on revenue but beat on earnings, and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell short on both the top and bottom lines.Addressing the regulatory environment on a conference call, Dimon said, ""I'm neither euphoric nor depressed.""He added that details of how corporate taxes will be cut likely won't be known for another nine to 12 months and that tax cut benefits to banks eventually will be ""competed away.""Still, he was optimistic overall about the changes to come, with Inauguration Day a week away, and downplayed Trump's protectionist stance as election-season rhetoric.""I think the Trump administration will do the right thing for America,"" Dimon said. ""They just need time.""Shares were up and down, but closed 0.5% higher at 86.70 on the stock market today. Bank of America rose 0.4%, and Wells Fargo climbed 1.5.

But those trends appeared unlikely to change the company's approach to investing, hiring or attempting to gain market share.""We're not going to change our plans very much, because we don't really react that much to the weather,"" Dimon said.RELATED:As The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The WayU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

249,MS,"For bank stocks during the fourth quarter, there was ""before Trump"" and ""after Trump.""But as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) lead the big banks into earnings season on Friday, Wall Street seems likely to turn its attention quickly to the latter, and how banks think they'll fare as a new, regulation-averse administration takes office.Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup (C), which reports on Jan. 18, have all said they expect gains in trading revenue during the quarter as investors uprooted their market expectations following Donald Trump's surprise election victory. The Fed's rate hike in December is unlikely to do much for net interest margins, but higher yields on the 10-year Treasury, which underpins rates on some student loans and many mortgages, could help. So could solid — but maybe not great — loan growth.""But it's really all about the forward outlook: Many banks will announce their 2017 guidance at earnings,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a research note last week. ""Better GDP outlook and higher rates, coupled with laser-focused expense management, should drive a positive forward look, supporting bank valuations through earnings.""Bank stocks were already on the rise before Trump's election on hopes for Fed rate hikes and signs in Q3 that some were returning to growth. Then they soared after Election Day  in anticipation of tax cuts, a lighter regulatory touch and infrastructure stimulus that boost economic growth. Wall Street will largely focus on banks' commentary on those measures and how higher rates will affect the bottom line and mortgage demand.""Bank stocks, financials, have generally had a great couple of months,"" David Hilder, director, capital markets at Drexel Hamilton, told IBD. ""But that's more about things that are expected to happen in the future.""Meanwhile, after soaring above 2.6% in mid-December, the 10-year Treasury yield has retreated to 2.35% on Thursday, testing its 50-day moving average intraday. Bank stocks have held up well, moving sideways in the last several weeks. If the 10-year yield can find support at the 50-day and rebound, bank stocks could see further gains. But if yields break that key line, shares of financials may struggle to hold up.Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.43, up 8%, with revenue ticking up to $23.928 billion.The biggest U.S. lender by assets and market cap has had strong loan growth in recent quarters, so expectations might be higher for them than others, Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told IBD.Commentary surrounding the company's expenses — as with other banks — could also drive the stock, Morgan Stanley said, describing the company as ""focused on driving positive operating leverage, particularly through cost saves in its consumer and (investment banking) division.""IBD'S TAKE: As interest rates rise, bank stocks are among the few market sectors that will actually benefit.Estimates: A 31% EPS jump to 38 cents on revenue of $20.89 billion, a 7% increase.Bank of America is more interest-rate sensitive than some of its rivals, largely because so much of its business is concentrated in the U.S. With the Fed in December signaling more rate hikes this year than it had in September, conversation during the earnings call could center around how a higher-rate environment would affect its outlook this year.Estimates: EPS of $1.00, down 3%, with revenue up 4% to $22.451 billion.Things to watch for: Even as Wells Fargo benefits from the same things that have helped the other big banks, the company's attempts to recover from a sham account scandal, revamp its sales incentives, and resubmitting its living will — the plan describing how a bank will end its operations if things come to that — will likely drive shares, Morgan Stanley said.New account openings plunged after news broke in September that Wells Fargo staff were accused of creating as many as 2 million fake accounts in consumers' names in attempt to hit sales goals in a high-pressure sales environment. Activity in existing accounts hasn't really changed, Stemm said.""If you're already a Wells customer, and have a lot of relationships with the bank, it's a big hassle to move, and you're probably not going to do it,"" Stemm said. ""But if you're brand-new, and you have the option to walk into the Wells door or walk into bank XYZ next door, it makes a lot of sense that perhaps some customers are choosing to go with someone else.""Wells Fargo, the top private mortgage lender, also faces rising mortgage rates, which could drive a near-term rush to buy homes before they go up any further but may weigh on demand long term.JPMorgan shares fell 1% on the stock market today, as bond yields and broader stock averages retreated. Bank of America lost 0.65%, and Wells Fargo 0.55%. Citigroup fell 1.2%. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which report next week, closed down 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively.Banks' gains come amid questions about how much higher interest rates and a steepening yield curve have been already priced into the market. Hilder added that bank stocks might still have room above them, but that some on Wall Street might be overestimating the extent to which a GOP Congress would be able to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.""Post earnings, there could be some pullback as details on tax reforms and infrastructure spend are flushed out, but we see this as a buying opportunity,"" Grasek added in the note. ""All-in, lower taxes and less regulation should set the stage for our bull case.""RELATED:Wells Fargo Backs Dividend Amid Scandal; JPMorgan, Citigroup TopU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-Mart

Trivago stock dipped 0.4% to 11.84 at the close on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: IPOs are a seedbed of innovation and can be huge stock winners, but can also reverse quickly. IBD writes in the IPO Leaders column about fast-growing companies that went public within the past three years. You can also read this Investor's Corner to maximize your chances for success with IPOs.The downsized Trivago IPO comes on the end of a rough year for IPOs. There were 105 IPOs in 2016, down 38% from the prior year, according to Renaissance Capital. Proceeds raised of $18.8 billion also were down 38%. The IPO market is expected to rebound this year, with high-profile names such as Snapchat-owner Snap, Spotify and Pinterest waiting in the wings.Founded in 2005 and headquartered in Dusseldorf, Germany, Trivago is a global hotel search platform that helps users search for and compare hotels. It helps shoppers find better prices and selection by aggregating hotel room inventory from across numerous online booking sites, known as a ""meta-search"" business model.Trivago's platform offered access to some 1.3 million hotels in over 190 countries as of Sept. 30, the company says. The company says its platform can be accessed via 55 localized websites and via apps in 33 languages.""While not yet generating meaningful profit, we see favorable risk/reward for Trivago given it has the fastest organic growth rate among large public online travel companies, a leadership position in meta-search, and established margin expansion in its oldest markets,"" Kopelman said in a research report.Trivago will continued to be controlled by Expedia, its largest shareholder, which as of Sept. 30 had a 63.5% stake.Expedia stock was up a fraction, to 117.62.

252,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) likely will trim its 2017 earnings view by $1 after spinning off its hemophilia business into publicly traded Bioverativ, and as sales of multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera continue to flounder, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday.The spinoff was approved late Tuesday, a day after Biogen announced Michel Vounatsos would succeed George Scangos as CEO. Vounatsos joined Biogen in April as its chief operating officer after a 20-year career at Merck (MRK). Scangos exited in July.Yee kept his outperform rating on Biogen stock, but cut his 2017 earnings per share ex items view to $19.17 vs. the $20 expectation he has for 2016. The consensus model remains at $21 EPS minus items for 2017, but that doesn't reflect ex-hemophilia sales, Yee says.""There could be some short-term noise or confusion"" after Biogen offers an updated outlook in January, Yee wrote in a research report. Meanwhile, Tecfidera sales ""don't look inspiring"" and rival Roche (RHHBY) is set to release ocrelizumab, a competing MS drug.Still, Yee notes Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) are bullish on new spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza. Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, met its primary endpoint in a pair of phase 3 studies, showing early efficacy.IBD'S TAKE: Will Donald Trump break with Republicans to pressure drug and biotech firms over their drug prices? Trump recently hinted he doesn't like the trajectory of drug prices — prompting med-tied stocks to topple.Yee assumes $55 million in Spinraza sales, but notes it could be up to $100 million and add 25 cents to 50 cents in EPS minus items if its approved in early 2017.Bioverativ is set to host an analyst day Jan. 6, Yee noted. Biogen will have no stake in the spinoff which will focus on developing treatments for hemophilia and rare blood diseases including sickle cell and beta-thalassemia. It will use gene-editing tech from Sangamo.""Investors appear to be lukewarm on this biz given Biogen choosing to spin it off and also uncertainty on long-term tail for hemophilia given ACE-910 phase 3 data due imminently in December, and gene therapy potential curative solutions,"" Yee wrote.ACE-910 is a hemophilia drug from Roche.Biogen shares edged 0.9% lower to 283.11 in the stock market today, yet continue to hug the critical 200-day moving average. The stock has been building a super-long bottoming base pattern since topping out at 480 in March 2015.Biogen was an outstanding market winner ever since it initially broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 58.74 in late October 2010. From that point, Biogen powered its way to a 717% gain until that 480 peak.Today, Biogen's Medical-Biomedical/Biotech industry group ranks 54th among 197 IBD industries, down from 26th six weeks ago. The group holds a staggering 421 stocks, many of them experimental-stage companies.Among those companies with a market value of $5 billion or more, only Seattle Genetics (SGEN), Tesaro (TSRO) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals hold Relative Price Strength Ratings of 90 or higher. Due to its long basing action, Biogen's RS Rating comes in at an unsurprisingly dismal 41, according to IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:Biogen Names New Insider CEO After Five-Month Search; Stock FallsHow To Invest Successfully: Know The Bottoming Base Pattern

253,MS,"Across nearly five decades in the 20th century, Gerald M. Loeb prospered in the world of Wall Street. So what made Loeb really stand apart?Perhaps it was Loeb's ability and desire to articulate exactly what it takes to win in the bond and stock markets. Loeb's gift to investors ultimately came in the form of a book, ""The Battle for Investment Survival.""Loeb writes with brutal honesty.""Nothing is more difficult, I truly believe, than consistently and fairly profiting in Wall Street,"" he wrote at the start of Chapter 1. ""I know of nothing harder to learn. Schools and textbooks supply only a good theoretical background.""Most individuals lose money on Wall Street because they don't prepare thoroughly, Loeb noted, or they don't spend enough time finding a professional who has mastered the skill of market timing.Loeb wanted people to take matters into their own hands. That is, don't be sold something on Wall Street. Do your own research and find something to buy.Don't simply trust an AAA rating for a bond or a very high price in a stock, because those are just snapshots of a security's value in a moment of time. Instead, look for high-quality merchandise on the market with a true potential to rise in value.""If you know what you want and why you want it and when you want it, you'll generally pay a lot less for it than you will if you buy something that somebody else persuades you to buy,"" Loeb, who eventually rose to the role of chairman of the Manhattan brokerage E.F. Hutton, was quoted as saying in ""The Wizard of Wall Street"" by Ralph Martin.Through ""The Battle for Investment Survival,"" Loeb tells readers to take no short cuts. Watch a stock carefully, understand its price behavior, and find correlations between its price cycles and how it relates to the company's underlying fundamentals. Be patient, wait for all the proverbial stars to align, then strike big.Last, but not least, recognize your mistakes early and exit a losing position quickly.How influential is ""The Battle for Investment Survival"" since it came out in 1935? So much so that the San Francisco native also oversaw 10 revised editions of his book over the next 30 years.The book deeply moved William O'Neil, a successful broker during the 1960s who formed an equity research firm that has served hundreds of institutional investors. O'Neil, who later founded IBD in 1984, once met with Loeb (1899-1974) to ask if he always stuck with the rule of selling a stock if it fell 10% below the purchase price. Loeb replied that he much preferred to be out of such a position well before such a loss. Without question, the first job in stock investing is preserving capital.""I think meeting Loeb made a big impact on Bill O'Neil,"" Bryan Anderson, market strategist at Austin-based Beck Capital Management, told IBD. Anderson also worked for William O'Neil + Co. as an in-house equities portfolio manager from 1993 to 2000. ""Loeb had great personal qualities. He valued honesty. He valued flexibility of thinking and being unbiased. You see that throughout the book.""Other golden nuggets in Loeb's book that resonate with IBD's CAN SLIM investing paradigm:Concentrate on your best investments. ""Diversification is a necessity for the beginner. On the other hand, the really great fortunes were made by concentration,"" Loeb wrote in a foreword to the 1965 edition. ""The greater your experience, the greater your capability for running risks, and the greater your ability to chart your course yourself, the less you need to diversify.""Take profits often; lock in gains frequently. ""Many 'long-pull' traders ignore a sign of a change of trend because they feel it is temporary. Often they are right, but eventually they are wrong, and usually at great cost. The short-term method requires the closing of the trade for a reason, and if later the situation changes, then one can re-establish the position,"" Loeb wrote.A stock can plunge even if the market is doing fine. In the postscript section of his book, Loeb notes that from 1960 to 1964, the Standard & Poor's average of 425 industrial stocks rose, but seven leading electronics companies within the average underperformed. Among those seven, Loeb added a simple line graph of Transitron Electronic falling from 60 to 4.63 over the same time frame, a 92% plunge.Even within a single industry, performance among companies can vary greatly. Loeb showed how Chrysler emerged as a big market winner, rising from 11.50 in 1961 to 50 by 1964 as new management led to outstanding growth in car sales, earnings and cash dividends. But rival American Motors, ""which had prospered mightily in the 1957-59 period, due to its success with compact cars, saw the demand shift and was adversely affected,"" Loeb wrote. From 1960 to 1964, AMC shares sank from a peak of 23.50 to 15.Build your position as a stock rises in price, not falls. ""I believe in pyramiding, not averaging,"" Loeb wrote.Loeb was born in July 1899 in San Francisco. His father sold a successful wine merchandising business in New Orleans and moved to the West Coast to start anew. Loeb's mother came from a wealthy family in which Loeb's grandfather struck it big in silver in Nevada, then invested his winnings in real estate in the Bay Area.The 1906 San Francisco earthquake all but shattered the family's wealth. Two years later, Loeb's father and grandfather died just two weeks apart. Loeb's mother, now widowed, moved into a boardinghouse to raise Loeb and his younger brother.Loeb learned to take financial responsibility at an early age. When Loeb was just 10, his mother took them on a trip to Europe and let young Gerald handle the hiring of a taxi, paying the hotel bill and tipping waiters on the steam ship across the Atlantic.""She always wanted me to be boss of my own money, even at the earliest age,"" Loeb said. ""For me, this freedom of experience . . . was the beginning of my financial education.""At age 11, Loeb contracted polio. Forced to spend much of his days in bed, Loeb devoured books. The physical handicap did not prevent Loeb from finishing high school, but he quit a plan to study architecture.An inheritance from his father sparked a lifelong passion in securities investing.At age 21 and with $13,000 in hand (roughly $221,000 in today's dollars), Loeb made two bond investments. The first purchase, a 15-year S.W. Straus Real Estate bond that offered 6% interest, was illiquid and market prices were arbitrary. The stated value of the real estate tied to the loans was highly questionable. Loeb sensed something was amiss and redeemed the bond for a small loss within a year. Later, the bond crashed to zero value after the issuers no longer could offset the big losses with the money received from bond sales.For his second purchase, he called upon his father's friend, a senior partner at a top brokerage in San Francisco, who recommended a high-quality British bond, payable either in sterling or dollars at the customer's option. Unlike the first bond, which paid a handsome commission to the seller, this bond gave the broker only $2.50 to $5 in commission. In the process, Loeb also learned how the broker sent the order to New York via telegraph, bought the bond on the floor, had the cashier ensure that it was authentic, and finally got it mailed to the new owner.A year later, Loeb saw the value of the bond rise and took his profit. He decided that he would do business the same way by acting in the customer's best interest.One day during his first job as a bond salesman, Loeb got a verbal lashing for refusing to follow bosses' orders to sell low-quality bonds to a physician client that would have given the broker the biggest commission. He quit the same day. Loeb immediately got a job at a respectable brokerage, learning every aspect of the business by assisting the bond salesman, the statistician and the stock trader.Loeb thrived in the securities business by adopting the ticker-tape machine, a sophisticated new technology at the time. Loeb not only learned much about tracking actionable price trends, but also became a reliable source of information to his customers. Trust among his customers was so great that they gave him discretionary power to buy stocks without client approval, then allocate the shares to accounts accordingly.""He was giving people honest information,"" Anderson said. ""Others were giving customers old information.""To further promote knowledge about business and the markets, Loeb launched an annual competition in 1957 to recognize excellence in financial journalism. He cared about the impact it could have to the public understanding of financial markets. The University of Connecticut acted as the initial steward of the awards. But in 1973, just a year before his death, Loeb decided to ask Harold Williams, a corporate lawyer who served as dean of UCLA's business school at the time, to become the new home of the prizes.Williams, who served as commissioner of the Securities & Exchange Commission, says Loeb was aware of his past speeches on the issues of corporate governance and the role of board directors. ""He felt my views were hospitable,"" Williams told IBD.Next year, the Gerald Loeb Awards celebrates its 60th anniversary with an awards banquet slated for June 27, 2017. The nonprofit organization, which operates primarily on sponsorships and private support, will begin calls for entries in January.""Quality journalism is essential for our students to get to know the challenges in global business and financial markets,"" Judy D. Olian, current dean of the UCLA Anderson School of Management, said. ""It presents the ethical dilemmas new managers will face, and forces them to ask what type of managers they want to become.""Excelled on Wall Street as a top-performing broker; rose to chairman at E.F.

If so, how do you find Mr. or Ms. Right?""Asking a friend is the biggest error I see,"" said Rich Feight, founder of IAM Financial, a planning firm in Grand Rapids, Mich. ""You don't know that the person who's recommended is going to be competent.""Feight is on the national board of directors of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors. On the NAPFA website is a ""Find an Advisor"" search option.Enter your address or ZIP code to get a list of NAPFA members in your area. There's also a brief firm-supplied profile, so you can get an idea of what its advisors have to say for themselves.A similar ""Find Your Planner Now"" opportunity is offered by the Financial Planning Association. Here, you can start by entering your state and then focus on your local area.The FPA is the principal professional organization for Certified Financial Planner (CFP) professionals, educators, financial services providers and students who seek advancement in a growing, dynamic profession. The FPA site offers an opportunity to focus on specialties, compensation method and professional designations. For example, you could ask for a certified financial planner who accepts fees as well as commissions, specializing in estate planning.Using these search engines can provide you with a list of possible advisors. Add recommendations from friends and family, if you wish — or get in touch with a financial planner who impressed you with comments in the media.The next step is to narrow your search. ""Look for an advisor who is willing to give you a simple 'get acquainted' meeting with no obligation,"" said Pamela Sandy, founder and CEO of Cleveland-based financial advisory firm Confiance and the current president of FPA. ""This meeting is not just useful to a potential client, but to an advisor as well.""In such a meeting, individuals can and should ask questions. ""Expect a qualified advisor to ask questions within this interview as well,"" Sandy said.The advisor might determine that a certain person may not be a good fit and that a fruitful working relationship is unlikely. According to Sandy, the decision to work together is really a joint decision, and the best advisor-client relationships start with this understanding.Once you sit down with an advisor for a meet-and-greet, choose your topics with care. A website created by Charles Schwab (findyourindependentadvisor.com/choosing-an-advisor.html) includes questions to ask. Examples:Alternatively, you might be looking for comprehensive financial planning. In that case, Feight said, you should see if the advisor can cover everything from budgeting and cash-flow analysis to taxes and insurance.Fee structures vary, but a common mode is to charge by assets under management. If an advisor is managing a $1 million portfolio, for example, charging a 1% fee, the annual fee would be $10,000. Some advisors offer break points, lowering the percentage charged on assets above a certain level.Commissions, on the other hand, are based on transactions for investments and perhaps insurance. In some cases, an upfront commission will be followed by a ""trailing"" payout to the advisor, so it's important to get the entire picture.""We also encourage investors to ask some specific questions about investment fees and how they impact returns,"" said Hibah Shariff, a spokesperson for Schwab. Individuals are urged to review the firm's fee schedule and ask for any clarification from the prospective advisor.You might not want to focus solely on investments, though. ""People believe that investment planning is financial planning, but that alone does not take into account other areas of a person's financial life and decision-making around major life events,"" Sandy said.Advisors can help clients with decisions about marriage, children, debt management (including student loans), and end-of-life planning. ""Over time,"" Sandy said, ""the best planners get their clients to understand that investments should be the fuel to support their life goals, not the focus of their life's plan.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

256,MS,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

257,MS,"On Dec. 23, 2016, the United States abstained and allowed the Security Council to adopt Resolution 2334 demanding that Israel stop all settlement activity. This resolution, unlike the 25 or so anti-Israel General Assembly resolutions passed each year, has real consequences.It provides legal authority under Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter for the Security Council or individual states to take Israel to the International Court of Justice, and sets the basis for the Council to enforce its commands by imposing sanctions under Chapter VII — including even the use of force. The incoming U.S. administration will veto any such effort. But the resolution will be invoked by states, the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and every anti-Israel public and private group in the world to justify lawsuits, boycotts, trade restrictions and outright acts of terror.President-elect Trump condemned the resolution and promises things will be different at the U.N. after Jan. 20th. He cannot be faulted for trying to keep the Obama administration from allowing adoption of so ill-considered and potentially damaging a resolution. Mr. Trump should respond with a plan of action that guts the resolution of its authority.Mr. Trump will hear from diplomats, foreign ambassadors and others that he cannot undo a Security Council resolution. That is nonsense.He can, as president, repudiate any international agreement. It will be easier to accomplish this objective, in fact, than it was for Secretary James Baker to convince the General Assembly to repeal its resolution equating Zionism and racism in 1991. John Bolton's effective effort under Secretary Baker's leadership drove a stake through the heart of that evil doctrine.A vehicle for President Trump's action in this regard is operative paragraph 12, requesting the secretary-general to report to the Council ""every three months on the implementation of the provisions of the present resolution.""President Trump should inform the Secretary-general before his first report on March 23, 2017, that the U.S. repudiates Resolution 2334 — that the U.S. will veto any effort to enforce its conclusions. He should also seek legislation imposing trade sanctions on states that rely on the resolution to discriminate against Israel, as the U.S. did successfully against the Arab boycott.Undoubtedly, the abstention was a calculated effort to punish Prime Minister Netanyahu for failing to take ""opportunities"" to accept Mr. Obama's position that Israel must stop all construction in all settlements to enable peace negotiations to proceed. As Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said in his press briefing: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today.""Secretary Kerry made clear that, rather than acting as a mediator seeking to develop common ground between Israel and the Palestinians, the Obama administration has preached about what it insists must be done regardless of what is possible in light of Palestinian hostility, the fact that Gaza is in terrorist hands, and the obvious limitations on Prime Minister Netanyahu's domestic political leverage.The arguments advanced to support the U.S. position are perverse. Ambassador Samantha Powers claimed U.S. presidents have all been against expanding settlements. But no administration has ever supported calling all Israeli settlements ""flagrant violations of international law,"" not even the Obama administration, which vetoed a similar resolution in 2011.President Reagan regarded the settlements as ""legal,"" and most other presidents have refrained from relying on inapposite principles of international law, shunning such ineffective hectoring. No administration has ever claimed Israel, as an ""occupying power"" during ""war"" must treat Palestine as a state.Ambassador Powers and Secretary Kerry claim that Israeli settlements are an obstacle to peace and threaten the possibility of a two-state solution. But as Ms. Powers acknowledged, ""many other factors contribute significantly to the tensions that perpetuate this conflict"" and that peace would not be achieved even if Israel eliminated ""every single settlement.""In fact, peace was achieved with Egypt and Jordan, and Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza, despite the need to dismantle some 34 settlements and remove over 17,000 settlers. And it has long been clear that settlements are the least problematic of the ""parameters"" for peace; even Mr. Arafat accepted Israel's retention of the major settlements around Jerusalem (with 80% of all settlers) in exchange for Israeli land.Once Mr. Obama advanced the thesis in his Cairo speech of June 4, 2009, that all settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace, ignoring the Bush letter of April 14, 2004, that recognized Israeli control of the major Jerusalem settlements as the likely outcome, Obama made it impossible for any Palestinian leader to demand less, and much more difficult for any Israeli leader to rely on U.S. representations.The irony for those who support a two-state solution, including Mr. Netanyahu, is that this resolution has caused many Israelis to favor more settlement construction. Every important Israeli leader denounced the U.S. abstention, because they know that the Palestinian Authority prefers costless victories at the U.N. to condemning terror and accepting a Jewish State.Whatever the U.S. may say about its intentions, as Ms. Powers acknowledged, any U.N. action will be exploited against Israel. Even the resolution's condemnation of terrorism, and its call to end incitement, will be used against Israel and ignored by those whose actions the U.S. pretends will be altered. In allowing the resolution's adoption, the U.S. joined those very states that Ms. Powers has repeatedly condemned for lacking moral conscience, even for Arabs let alone Jews.The abstention, in short, was a shameful act openly touted as punishment for Israel's failure to abide by a U.S. policy that set back the prospects of peace. The Trump administration must repudiate Resolution 2334 in order to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, by recognizing that Israel's settlements are not an obstacle to peace if peace were genuinely pursued.

259,MS,"The day after the presidential election the executive director of the Sierra Club glumly called the Donald Trump victory ""deeply disturbing for the nation and the planet."" Well, yes, if you're a climate change alarmist who hates fossil fuels, you're in for a bad four and maybe eight years.Greenpeace Executive Director Annie Leonard was even more apocalyptic, saying: ""I never thought I'd have to write this. The election of Donald Trump as President has been devastating. … There's no question, Donald Trump's climate denial is staggering. He wants to shut down the EPA, cancel the Paris Cimate Agreement, stop funding clean energy research and drill baby drill."" Ah, but if this is so crazy, why did he win?The short answer is that Americans went to the polls and rejected environmental extremism among other things. The biggest loser on election night was the Big Green movement in America dedicated to the anti-prosperity proposition that to save the planet from extinction we have to deindustrialize the U.S. and throw millions and millions of ‎our fellow citizens out of their jobs. Voters turned thumbs down on the climate change lobby and rightfully so.It may seem an exaggeration to say that the radical leftist green groups want to throw working class Americans out of their jobs — but it isn't. They openly admit it.The Sierra Club actually declared ""victory"" last year when it helped push several of America's leading coal production companies into bankruptcy.Sierra Club spokeswoman Lena Moffitt took credit for destroying coal production in America, but she neglected to mention the tens of thousands of miners, truckers, construction workers and other blue collar workers who lost their jobs due to the Sierra Club campaign. What humanitarians these people are!Ms. Moffitt promised that the Sierra Club will ""bring the same expertise that we brought to taking down the coal industry and coal-fired power in this country to taking on gas in the same way. … to ensure that we're moving to a 100% clean energy future.""Wait a minute. There are an estimated 10 million Americans who are directly or indirectly employed by the oil and gas and coal industries. The left wants to put every one of these people out of a job? Will they use Stalinistic worker relocation programs to pull this off?And by the way, someone might want to inform these self-proclaimed scientific geniuses that natural gas is clean energy.‎Fortunately, we learned on Election Day that voters aren't as alarmed as the alarmists are. Almost none of the voters that I met in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana or Michigan had anything but contempt for the climate change fanatics. They view this as another attempt by Washington to run their lives and completely ignore their economic plight in favor of grandiose dreams of the government somehow changing the weather.In so many ways climate change was one of the primary issues that allowed Donald Trump to crash through the blue wall of the industrial Midwest. The Democrats' preposterous opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline, which could create as many as 10,000 high-paying construction, welding, pipe fitting and electrician jobs, is emblematic of how the party that is supposed to represent union workers turned their backs on their own members and their families.The Paris climate-change treaty puts America last and forces us to stop using cheap, reliable and abundant domestic fossil fuels while the rest of the world — particularly China and India — are all-in on coal. Nobody in Washington seemed to notice that, as the Wall Street Journal reported last month, ""China's government said it would raise coal power capacity by as much as 20% by 2020, ensuring a continuing strong role for the commodity in the country's energy sector.""That's more than the entire energy usage of Canada in a year. Um, does this sound like a country that has any interest in cutting its carbon emissions? Amazing that the truck drivers in Indiana, and the coal workers in West Virginia, and the steel producers in Ohio get that the rest of the world is laughing at us, and the president of the United States doesn't.The surprise of this election is that Democrats were surprised by the mass voter rejection of the radical climate-change agenda. Every poll for the last five years, at least, has shown that climate change barely registers as a leading concern of American voters. Jobs and the economy were always issues Nos. 1 and 2, and global warming was usually close to last on the list.A 2015 Fox News poll found that only 3% of Americans believed that climate change was ""the most important issue facing America today.""That means 97% disagreed with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer that global warming was the greatest threat to America. This didn't stop Hillary Clinton from telling West Virginians that she would put every coal miner out of a job. Then she wonders why she got crushed in this unionized, historically reliably Democratic state.The issue that now confronts Democrats is whether they can reconnect with blue collar union voters by disassociating themselves from the fanatical greens who are trying to destroy union blue-collar jobs. It won't be easy. Environmental groups are said to be raising record hauls of cash from their millionaire and billionaire donors since the election. Ultra-green environmentalists like Tom Steyer may call the party's tunes, but then don't be surprised when millions of blue collar middle-class workers flee to the Republicans.In the Democratic Party, something has to give. My prediction is that Democrats will only make a comeback in American politics when they throw the likes of crazies such as Tom Steyer, the Sierra Club, and Greenpeace off the bus and start listening to the everyday concerns of working class Americans again.

The central bank also raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 0.5%-0.75%, from 0.25%-0.5%, as was expected.JPMorgan closed virtually flat, dropping 3 cents to 84.73 on the stock market today after rising as high as 86.12 soon after the fed announcement. Bank of America rose 0.3% while Citigroup (C) lost 0.6%. Wells Fargo (WFC) dropped 2%.Goldman Sachs (GS) edged up 0.6%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) added 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of fewer regulations under a Trump administration has sent bank stocks higher. Trump's announcement that he would focus on developing the nation's infrastructure has also lifted steel stocks. When the Fed increases its interest rates, banks can, in turn, raise their own rates and expand their net interest margins.Soon after the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon, banks began saying their prime lending rates are going up. But not all banks will be affected by the Fed's move in the same ways.Investment bank Goldman Sachs is seen benefiting especially from higher rates and market volatility as it relies more on fixed-income, currency and commodity trading. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods also said last month BofA's cost cuts position it better than its rivals to take advantage of higher rates.But Citigroup's exposure to overseas markets has been flagged as a concern as higher rates and the stronger dollar send investors' money to the U.S.The rate hike also boosted the 10-year Treasury yield, which also moves mortgage rates higher, and Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender by volume.RELATED:Federal Reserve Hikes Rates, Now Sees 3 Moves In 2017; Yellen On TapWhy BofA, Goldman Sachs Could Stand Out In Bank RallyBanking ETFs Emerge As Leaders After Postelection Rally

264,MS,"Deutsche Bank AG said it reached a $7.2 billion agreement to resolve a years-long U.S. investigation into its dealings in mortgage-backed securities, removing a legal hurdle that fueled investor angst.Deutsche Bank will pay a $3.1 billion civil penalty and provide $4.1 billion in relief to consumers under a settlement in principle with U.S. authorities, which was announced by the Frankfurt-based bank in a statement early Friday. The firm expects pretax charges of about $1.2 billion this quarter because of the fine.While the deal is below the Justice Department's initial request of $14 billion, Germany's biggest lender still faces U.S. investigations into other matters and potentially expensive civil suits. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has made resolving litigation a priority as he seeks to restore confidence in the lender.""The financial consequences, if any, of the consumer relief are subject to the final terms of the settlement, and are not currently expected to have a material impact on 2016 financial results,"" the bank said.Ahead of Friday’s statement, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods had estimated a fine exceeding $9 billion would cause the bank’s capital to fall to dangerous levels requiring action.The bank will publish preliminary 2016 results as scheduled on Feb. 2, it said.Deutsche Bank had set aside 5.9 billion euros ($6.2 billion) for all of its outstanding legal costs as of Sept. 30, when its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at 11.1 percent. The bank targets a level of at least 12.5 percent in 2018. Each $1 billion of litigation costs not covered by provisions would lower the ratio by 20-25 basis points, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Arjun Bowry has estimated.In a related case, the Justice Department sued Barclays (BCS) for fraud over its sale of mortgage bonds after the bank balked at paying the amount the government sought in negotiations. The lawsuit announced on Thursday is rare for big banks, which typically settle with the government rather than risk drawn-out litigation and a possible trial.The Obama administration is pressing to wrap up investigations of Wall Street firms for creating and selling the subprime mortgage bonds that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. Authorities have already extracted more than $46 billion in fines from six U.S. financial institutions over their dealings in mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America (BAC), which had the largest such settlement, agreed to pay $16.7 billion over bonds that were worth four times those of Deutsche Bank.Concern about whether Deutsche Bank had enough capital roiled markets and pushed the stock to a record low after it said in September that the U.S. Justice Department had made the opening request of $14 billion and that it had no intention of paying that amount.The consumer relief will include ""loan modifications"" and other assistance to homeowners and borrowers over at least five years, the bank said.The agreement doesn't resolve probes into whether the bank manipulated foreign-currency rates and precious metals prices and whether it facilitated transactions that helped investors illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. Deutsche Bank also faces civil lawsuits related to claims that its traders manipulated key interbank interest rates. It isn't clear how much more wrapping up these cases will cost.Deutsche Bank already has paid more than $9 billion in fines and legal settlements worldwide since the start of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes settlements related to violations of U.S. sanctions, rigging of interest-rate benchmarks and allegations that it defrauded U.S.-backed mortgage issuers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.A slump in earnings, negative interest rates and challenging markets have caused the bank to continue to struggle this year. Cryan's strategy, announced in October 2015, called for cost cuts and the elimination of dividends for two years to preserve capital. Deutsche Bank has said it may not be profitable in 2016 as it focuses on moving past its legal battles.At least four other European banks remain under investigation over the role of their mortgage-backed securities business: Credit Suisse (CS), UBS (UBS), HSBC (HSBC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). In addition to Bank of America, U.S. banks that have settled include Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Wells Fargo (WFC) and Moody's (MCO) have disclosed U.S. investigations into their mortgage-backed securities dealings and have said they're cooperating.

265,MS,"Drugmaker Biogen (BIIB) on Monday named its Chief Commercial Officer Michel Vounatsos as its new CEO effective Jan. 6.He replaces George Scangos, who announced in July that he would step down after leading the Cambridge, Mass.-based company for six mostly up years after a new CEO was named. Some saw the announcement as a sign Biogen could be a takeover candidate.Scangos guided the company over a growth period that saw it launch such products as much-heralded oral multiple-sclerosis treatment Tecfidera, but the drug pipeline has been drier of late.Vounatsos joined Biogen in April 2016 after a 20-year career at drugmaker Merck (MRK).Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, had reported of the impending appointment minutes before the close of Monday's regular trading session, sending shares tumbling more than 3% in the final minutes of trading. Biogen issued its press release shortly thereafter, and shares were down nearly 1% in after-hours trading. Biogen stock ended Monday's regular session down 2.6% at 278.77.Vounatsos has demonstrated his extensive global biopharmaceutical experience and track record of innovative stakeholder engagement in leading the company's commercial organization, Biogen said in its press release. ""He has implemented key initiatives to extend the company's industry leadership in multiple sclerosis, expanded Biogen's reach in key global markets, and effectively prepared for the introduction of breakthrough treatments for patients in areas of high unmet need,"" the statement said.IBD'S TAKE: Even in a down time for drug stocks in general, it's generally safe to expect they'll be represented on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. See which two drug stocks are on the current list.""I am excited to build upon Biogen's legacy, as we pursue innovative new therapies for those suffering from serious neurologic and neurodegenerative diseases and create value for shareholders by maintaining a clear focus on what is best for patients,"" Vounatsos said in the release. ""Our near-term priorities are clear.""We intend to gain approval for Spinraza to provide the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy; continue to grow our global MS franchise; fully enroll our phase 3 trials for aducanumab as we advance our lead candidate in Alzheimer's disease; reinvigorate our pipeline in the areas of neurology and neuro-repair; and invest in our employees as we work together to define our future.""The company has focused on treatments for neurological, autoimmune and rare diseases. Besides multiple sclerosis, its treatment areas include hemophilia. It faces a patent infringement for Tecfidera from Danish drugmaker Forward Pharma (FWP).RELATED:Biogen CEO Quits Amid M&A Speculation

270,MS,"HSBC started coverage of Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) Monday, Citigroup upgraded its outlook for the mining sector, including Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP), while Needham upgraded shares of recent IPO Quantenna (QTNA).Shares of the highest-profile investment banks have been surging since Donald Trump's victory on expectations of increased M&A activity, corporate tax cuts and robust capital markets activity helped along by the prospect of lower capital gains taxes.Still, HSBC sees further upside for Goldman Sachs, which it started with a buy rating and 250 price target. HSBC sees less upside for Morgan Stanley, which it gave a hold rating and 42 target.Shares of Goldman rose 2.3% to 228.55 on the stock market today. Morgan Stanley shares rose 0.6% to 42.09.Citigroup upgraded its outlook for the metals and mining sector from bearish to bullish, though adding that it sees the extent of some commodity prices increases as ""a fluke,"" with gains in coking coal and iron ore in that category.""A stronger cyclical U.S. backdrop, coupled with improved supply and demand fundamentals could keep industrial commodity prices buoyant in our view,"" Citi analysts wrote.Along with that brighter view, Citi lifted its ratings on diversified mining giants BHP to buy from sell and Rio Tinto to neutral from sell.BHP shares advanced 1.9% to 38.73. Rio Tinto added 1.2% to 39.49.Needham upgraded shares of the Wi-Fi chipset maker to strong buy from buy, giving it a 25 target and touting Quantenna as its top pick for 2017.Needham said the recent pullback in the shares don't reflect fundamentals, citing ""long-lived design wins with some of the world's largest service providers"" that will result in robust revenue growth and operating leverage.Shares of Quantenna shot up 15.7% to 19.47.IBD'S TAKE: With Quantenna shares surging on Needham's table-pounding recommendation, keep in mind that successfully trading IPOs requires different technical analysis than more seasoned stocks.

271,MS,"What's good for the goose ought to be good for the gander — unless the goose happens to be Democrats in Congress. On November 30, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was re-elected as House minority leader by her colleagues, who voted in a secret-ballot election. Yet this is the same type of election that congressional Democrats, egged on by their labor-union backers, have routinely sought to deny to millions of workers nationwide.Free and fair elections at every level of American government depend on voters making their own choices without fear of intimidation or reprisal. That was certainly true of House Democrats on Wednesday. Imagine if every member had been forced to publicly declare whether they were voting for Ms. Pelosi or her challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. Those who voted for Ryan might have opened themselves up to retaliation.Unfortunately, this hypothetical for Congress is a reality in millions of workplaces across the country. Federal labor law permits labor unions to be certified or recertified on the basis of so-called card checks. Union representatives conduct a card check by questioning workers (often publicly) on where they stand regarding a certification decision, asking them to openly sign their name on a card. This signature is a legally binding agreement representing the worker's support for the union; if over 50% of workers sign a card, then an employer must recognize the union.Although union certification decisions can be made by secret ballots, card checks have become an increasingly common method of unionization in recent years. The most recently available data provided by the National Labor Relations Board show that nearly 40% of union certifications as of 2009 were the result of such a card check.As a result, more workers are losing the freedom to privately decide whether joining a union is the right decision. But not only does this often force workers to make snap judgments, it also opens up the possibility of harassment and intimidation. Workers in many states have testified to this.One Indiana manufacturing employee testified to Congress in 2011 that union representatives were relentless in their pressure during a union certification process. ""They'd approach us during our lunch breaks. They would even follow us to our vehicles at the end of the day and some of us even to our homes.""After being harangued incessantly, another worker testified that ""The only way, it seems, to stop the badgering and pressure is to sign the card.""Union organizers aren't the only ones who make card-check decisions a nightmare for workers. Some report that their own co-workers turn against them. Because card checks allow everyone in a workplace to know how workers feel about the union, it opens dissenters up to reprisal.One Indiana employee spoke about threats she received after a card check. ""I have my reasons for the way that I voted. That's nobody else's business, and had it not been for the card check, nobody would know if I was for or against."" Countless similar stories have been reported in recent years.Such actions are precisely why the secret-ballot election is so critically important. And that's why congressional Democrats used a secret ballot in their recent leadership election. Yet many of those same Democrats actively sought to deny workers a right to private ballots for their union representation, even introducing legislation in recent years — the grossly misnamed Employee Free Choice Act — that would effectively neuter the practice altogether and make card checks mandatory in all American workplaces.And although that particular bill failed, congressional Democrats continue trying to make card checks the end-all, be-all method of certifying a union. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who joined the party as part of his presidential campaign, introduced a similar bill last year called the Workplace Democracy Act.Under such regimes, workers would have even less freedom to use their judgment regarding union membership. But even without these bills, workers are too often forced to accept union representation they don't want. Data from the Heritage Foundation show that 94% of unionized workers have either never been given the opportunity to vote on their own unionization, or voted against the union that represents them.Fortunately, there is legislation in Congress seeking to protect workers' rights to confidential ballots and union certification votes. The Employee Rights Act, introduced by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, will likely be reintroduced when the 115th Congress convenes in January. It guarantees workers' right to secret-ballot elections, not only for unionization drives but also for strikes. This would protect every workers' fundamental right. As polling from the Center for Union Facts shows, a stunning 85% of union households support this provision.Democrats in Congress are sure to oppose the Employee Rights Act, as they have for years. But their hypocrisy couldn't be more brazen. Nancy Pelosi was just re-elected using the same election process that she and her colleagues would gladly deny to American workers. The right to free and fair elections is too important to be restricted to the halls of Congress and not the factory floor.

273,MS,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) continued their postelection ascent on Wednesday after President-elect Trump's pick for Treasury secretary told CNBC he would shuck some Dodd-Frank financial regulations.The bank stocks were also helped by Treasury yields, which rose eight basis points to 2.37% Wednesday afternoon.Bond yields jumped as oil prices spiked on the OPEC agreement to cut oil production. Higher oil prices could spur higher inflation, boosting market rates. A wider yield spread, in turn, could lift profitability for banks, which borrow short-term but lend long-term.JPMorgan rose 1.6% in the stock market today, while Bank of America jumped 4.1%. Citigroup (C) was up 1.6%. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were up 3.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Trump's Treasury pick, Steven Mnuchin, told CNBC that ""we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending."" Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs partner.IBD'S TAKE: As banks rally amid the White House transition, here's a look at why Goldman Sachs and Bank of America could be among the best-positioned banks during the Trump years. Those remarks follow Wall Street's anticipation that a Trump administration and a GOP Congress would ease restrictions on banks put up by President Obama in attempt to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis and Great Recession.Bond yields have also risen on the prospect of Trump's infrastructure-development and tax-cut plans, which some investors believe could increase growth and inflation and dump a huge amount of new government debt into the market. Bond yields rise when bond prices fall.Higher inflation could also raise the likelihood that the Federal Reserve might raise the benchmark interest rate, which would boost the amount that banks take in on loans.RELATED:Citigroup Comes Under ECB Regulation And Is Deemed RiskierU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

274,MS,"Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are among the best-positioned banks to gain from a wave of postelection Fed rate hikes and greater trading volatility, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said Tuesday in a note upgrading the stocks to outperform.Bank of America is likely to have the best earnings-growth arc relative to its rivals, aided by its cost-cutting efforts and higher interest rates, KBW said. Since Goldman relies heavily on fixed-income, currency and commodity trading, the bank could benefit more from a more active trading environment.KBW, which has updated its economic outlook following Donald Trump's election, sees the big banks benefiting ""only modestly from deregulation"" beginning next year and beyond.But the investment firm's forecast now assumes an increase in the federal funds rate in December, two hikes next year and two more in 2018 — potentially boosting banks' net-interest margins, or the difference between what banks make on interest from loans and interest paid to depositors.""In general, we are more confident in rising rates and better trading vs. wide-sweeping regulatory changes, and we believe BAC and GS offer the best exposure to both at still reasonable valuations,"" analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in the research note.Bank of America fell 1 cent to 20.29 in the stock market today, near Friday's eight-year high and up about 24% so far in November.Goldman advanced 0.7%. JPMorgan (JPM), for which KBW also has an outperform rating, climbed 0.8%. Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) edged up 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Ever since President-elect Trump last vowed to improve the nation's infrastructure, investors have renewed their focus on the stocks that could benefit. Here's a broader look at what stocks could drive a potential bull market in the Trump era.Bank stocks have rallied following Trump's upset victory this month, with Wall Street expecting a Trump administration and GOP Congress to ease regulations on the finance industry.Trump's plans to cut taxes and develop the nation's infrastructure also raised expectations of a flood of new government debt, pushing bond prices lower but the yields on those bonds higher, particularly for long-end Treasuries. That could also pad the profitability of banks, which borrow short-term but lend long-term.The bank rally also comes as FDIC-insured banks' net income spiked 13% in the third quarter, with the percentage of unprofitable banks falling to their lowest level since Q3 of 1997, the FDIC said Tuesday.""Nevertheless, the banking industry continues to operate in a challenging environment,"" FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said in a statement.""Low interest rates for an extended period have led some institutions to reach for yield, which has increased their exposure to interest-rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk,"" he continued. ""Current oil and gas prices continue to affect borrowers that depend on the energy sector and have had an adverse effect on asset quality. These challenges will only intensify as interest rates normalize.""RELATED:Citigroup Comes Under ECB Regulation And Is Deemed RiskierU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

Energy companies led gains in European equity markets.OPEC's three largest producers — Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran — overcame disagreements to reach Wednesday's deal in a bid to drain record global stockpiles and boost crude prices. Russia committed to cooperate with the group by curbing production next year. After hailing the accord, analysts highlighted the need for producers to comply with their pledges.""The market's rising strongly because there was a lot of skepticism about OPEC's ability to come to an agreement,"" said Mark Watkins, the Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager for the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank, which oversees $136 billion in assets.

278,MS,"A Citigroup (C) Irish subsidiary will be regulated by the European Central Bank starting next year, a move that could allow the bank to more easily sell financial services across much of the European Union following the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the bloc.That subsidiary, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was deemed on Monday to be large enough and important enough to be supervised by the ECB following its merger last year with the U.K.'s Citibank International, according to Reuters.If a bank's assets within a eurozone nation, like Ireland, become large enough, they can become eligible for ECB supervision, Reuters notes. The ECB supervision gives a bank easier access to the eurozone's financial market.Analysts have been concerned that U.S. banks that use London as a springboard into the rest of the European market could have more difficulty accessing the rest of the European Union as the U.K. renegotiates how it does business with the rest of the Continent.Citigroup in particular also faces concerns about its prospects in Mexico, a nation it believes has ""tremendous untapped potential,"" if President-elect Donald Trump takes a tougher stance on international trade.Citi's Irish subsidiary oversees the bank's retail operations in Europe, but not its trading and brokerage businesses, Reuters said.Shares rose 8 cents to 55.54 in the stock market today, following a steep postelection climb upward.IBD'S TAKE: Along with bank stocks, steel stocks have also surged following the election on expectations that Trump's infrastructure plans could bring more demand and investment to the industry. The new oversight from the ECB comes as the Financial Stability Board on Monday said that Citigroup's risk to the global financial system had risen since last year.The international board put Citigroup in second-highest tier of global systemically important banks, or banks considered essential to the world's financial health. JPMorgan (JPM) was the only other bank in that tier; no banks were in the highest. The more important the bank, the tougher their capital requirements those banks face.Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also had their risk profile raised by the board, which was formed in 2009 and consists in part of the G-20 nations.Citigroup on Monday also said that it would raise its stock buyback plan by as much as $1.75 billion.JPMorgan rose 0.4%, while Bank of America climbed 1.65%.

Volume in the stock market today declined roughly 15% on the NYSE and 10% on the Nasdaq from the previous session's pace, according to preliminary figures.Follow-up action has been rather weak among the major indexes, but small caps and select sectors have done very well. Bulls would like to see some days of big gains in rising volume.Banks have been the star sector recently.

Nine bank stocks now make up about half of the Big Cap 20, which is a list of the best big caps by fundamentals and technicals. On Tuesday, bank winners led losers in the Big Cap 20.Big Cap 20 members Morgan Stanley (MS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), KeyCorp (KEY) and Regions Financial (RF) each rose more than 1%, according to preliminary data. Goldman Sachs (GS), Citizens Financial Bank (CFG) and SunTrust Banks (STI) scored smaller gains. M & T Bank (MTB) lost ground.The construction aggregates and cement stocks also have been leaders. But Tuesday, they were taking a timeout. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) recorded losses but without damaging the overall bullishness of their chart patterns.Meanwhile, economic news was mostly positive.Retail sales for October were stronger than expected, and September results were revised upward. The Street expected a 0.6% pop in October, but the percentage came in at 0.8% — above the highest estimate in the range. The September figure initially was reported at 0.6% but was revised to 1%.Most stocks in the retail sector are currently laggards. Of the 18 groups in the retail sector, roughly two-thirds are in the bottom half among 197 industry groups. The one highly rated group is department stores, which is No. 8.Manufacturing also topped expectations.

282,MS,"When Christie Tucker's son Preston was diagnosed with diabetes, his insulin prescription cost just $40. Now, two years later, Christie is paying $650 for a six-week supply of the medicine.Many people reflexively blame drug companies for Christie's dilemma. But the firms producing Preston's insulin aren't making more money. Insulin list prices are going up, but net prices — the money drug firms actually receive — are falling sharply. The extra cash is instead landing in the pockets of pharmacy benefit managers.Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between drug companies and patients, pharmacists and insurers. They determine which medicines are covered, and at what co-pay or co-insurance level, for 210 million Americans' health plans. They're abusing this role to rake in enormous profits — at the expense of patients' health.The gatekeeper role gives PBMs enormous bargaining power to buy medicines in bulk. Just three PBMs dominate 70% of the market,  and pharmaceutical companies know they will not be able to access millions of patients unless they accommodate the demands of PBMs.With that disproportionate negotiating power, PBMs coerce pharmaceutical companies into offering substantial discounts and rebates.There's nothing inherently wrong with this hardball strategy. In theory, PBMs do patients a great service by securing lower drug prices.The problem is that, in practice, PBMs rarely pass the rebates they wrench away from drug companies along to pharmacies, insurers or patients. PBMs instead hoard the cash. Express Scripts, the nation's largest PBM — which boasted a market cap of $43 billion  in early November — has increased its profit per adjusted prescription 500% since 2003.Disturbingly, PBMs are maximizing their negotiating leverage, and thus their rebates, by refusing to cover dozens of lifesaving drugs. Combined, the top two PBMs in the country deny coverage to 239 medicines.When PBMs decrease coverage, patients suffer. Consider the plight of the 400,000 Americans with multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease that causes pain, fatigue and a loss of muscle control.CVS Health, the nation's second-largest PBM, excludes three top multiple sclerosis treatments in order to pressure the makers of other treatments into giving steeper discounts. That's dangerous for MS patients whose doctors purposely prescribed one of those three treatments to help them manage their disease.When drugs aren't covered by a PBM-determined insurance plan, many patients give up and stop taking the medications, rather than appeal for an exemption. One study, examining 60,000 Americans, found that when PBMs excluded drugs, almost half of patients simply stopped taking those medicines.Patients who fail to take the medications their doctors prescribe often develop complications, ending up in the emergency room or hospital. That drives up overall health care costs by billions of dollars annually. Grimly, nonadherence causes 125,000 deaths every year.Pharmacy benefit managers are supposed to negotiate big rebates on drug prices. And they do. But they're pocketing the cash instead of passing discounts along to patients. When patients across the nation either can't access lifesaving drugs, or must shell out a fortune to do so, it's time to ask: Who exactly benefits from pharmacy benefit managers?

284,MS,"Big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) continued their postelection stock-market surge on Thursday, amid rising odds for less regulation, higher inflation and Fed rate hikes next year.CNBC also reported that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is being considered for Treasury secretary.Shares of JPMorgan rallied 4.6% to close at 76.65 in the stock market today, setting a record high. Bank of America surged 4.4% to 18.76, blowing past buy range after breaking out Wednesday. Citigroup rose 3.9% to 53.61, reaching the highest in 11 months.Wells Fargo (WFC) leapt 7.6%, adding to Wednesday's 5.4% pop. Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 4.3% and Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 4.1%.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield added 7 basis points to 2.14% after skyrocketing Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have jumped, and the Dow has touched an all-time high following Trump's victory. So have other infrastructure-spending-friendly stocks, like construction companies. Thursday's stock gains follow a strong performance for banking on Wednesday, amid greater anticipation that President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress would work to curb industry regulations, including potentially gutting Dodd-Frank.After a wild, toxic, stressful presidential campaign in which the big banks were often a punching bag, analysts have also said Trump's more cordial, evenhanded victory speech — and its focus on a massive infrastructure overhaul — helped lift markets Wednesday after being pressured in the run-up to Election Day.Analysts have said Trump's focus on tax cuts and public infrastructure spending could bring higher inflation on a flood of new debt coming to the market and higher bond yields.The rising inflation, along with the current market rally, have also helped shore up the odds that the Federal Reserve might raise the benchmark interest rate, potentially boosting banks' net-interest margins.Trump's election, however, doesn't come without risks to the banking sector, analysts note.""The opportunities come primarily from a steepening yield curve, increased volatility and reduced regulation,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note. ""The risks come from a retrenchment of the U.S. from the global economy and trade agreements.""In a separate note, KBW said it was ""more cautious"" on Citigroup, given the company's exposure to Mexico, a country that could be among the most vulnerable if Trump shreds existing U.S. trade pacts.Citigroup in September said it saw ""tremendous untapped potential"" in Mexico.RELATED:Wells Fargo Backs Dividend Amid Scandal; JPMorgan, Citigroup TopBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain EmbraceJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo Earnings Top

286,MS,"The potential fees and reputation boost that could come from working on Uber Technologies' initial public offering are the stuff of bankers' dreams.Yet at least two investment banks passed on selling shares of Uber to their high-net-worth clients — shares eventually sold by other banks in January — because the ride-share company wasn't willing to provide financial details about its business, people with knowledge of the matter said.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Deutsche Bank both turned down the opportunity to offer their wealthiest clients the option to invest in Uber, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) ended up selling the shares earlier this year through those firms' private wealth divisions.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were concerned they wouldn't be able to fill demand for the offering given the lack of specifics, the sources said. Deutsche Bank also took into consideration that share sales through banks' private-wealth divisions are unusual, and it hadn't done one before, one of the sources said.The last such offering of a big technology company was more than four years ago. In that case, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) sold private shares of Facebook (FB) to international clients before the company went public in 2012.A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while a representative for Bank of America didn't respond to a request for comment.With a company like Uber, the major banks play a long game of relationship building to be best positioned when the company does pick banks to go public. While the Uber share sale was run through the private wealth divisions, it may still help put the firms in the company's good graces. With the timing of any Uber IPO unclear, banks' willingness to forgo that business is notable.Before that sale, it seemed Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and his management team had most of the leverage. For example, the company told bankers if the firms do any business for its biggest U.S. competitor, Lyft, they'd be less likely to be hired, according to people familiar with those discussions.So far, Kalanick has managed to deflect questions about the timing of the IPO. As recently as last month, he likened Uber to an ""early high schooler"" being asked to the prom. It's still a little too soon, he insisted.That reflected some progress from what he'd said a year earlier: ""We're like eighth-graders; we're in junior high, and someone is telling us that we need to go to the prom.""Uber hasn't had any trouble raising money since its founding in 2009, because investors typically want in on a highly valued startup before it goes public and the banks want a shot at a role when it does.The San Francisco-based company has garnered more than $16 billion in cash and debt since it started more than six years ago, most recently at a valuation of $69 billion. If it were to go public at that level, it would have a higher valuation than almost 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank passed on the opportunity to do business with Uber just as investor sentiment started to change for market-bound technology companies. There was a backlog of closely held internet companies, with more than 144 valued at more than $1 billion, research firm CB Insights said in a report.Colin Stewart, a managing director at Morgan Stanley who oversees tech financing at the bank, said at the time that private placements would no longer be the place to find ""very strong valuations with a plethora of investors hanging around the hoop.""Underwhelming post-IPO performances by some technology companies, including payments company Square (SQ), didn't help. Investors wanted to see a clear path to profitability.The 290-page prospectus Morgan Stanley sent to prospective investors before the January sale didn't include Uber's net income or annual revenue. The document did include 21 pages of risks, namely competition, regulatory hurdles and no assurance that the clients would see any return on their investment.The New York-based bank addressed the lack of data in its prospectus, saying ""the development of insights and big ideas is valuable to the investment process, whereas obsession over incremental 'information' flow is not.""Uber initially asked Deutsche Bank to be on the offering because it wanted to sell the stock to international investors, one of the sources said.Demand for the offering was higher from international clients than domestic, according to two people familiar with the matter. There was demand for more shares than were offered, another person said.Despite passing up on a role in the private offering, JPMorgan advised Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber that was announced in June.

287,MS," A highly respected American rabbi named Dr. Irving ""Yitz"" Greenberg used to tell American Jewish audiences, whether Reform, Conservative Orthodox, ""I don't care what denomination you're a member of, as long as you're ashamed of it.""I have adopted that phrase, and I apply it to religions generally. One could just as easily say to Catholics, Protestants and Muslims, ""I don't care what religion you identify with, as long as you're ashamed of it."" Meaning, of course, you're ashamed of what many of its members have done to it.Just think of what has happened to much of mainstream Protestantism; to much of Catholicism, including, sadly, the current pope; and most especially, to the Islamic world.Given the subject of this column — the destructive influence of leftism on Jews and Judaism — it is relevant to mention some of my Jewish involvement. Among other things, I taught Jewish history and religion at Brooklyn College, was the spokesman for the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, have written two books and hundreds of essays and columns on Jews and Judaism, received the American Jewish Press Association Louis Rapoport Award for Excellence in Jewish Commentary, have brought many thousands of Jews to Judaism and have lectured to more Jewish groups in the past 40 years than almost any living Jew.So, I say this with only sadness: Many American Jews on the left, including rabbis and lay leaders, are embarrassing Jews and Judaism. I say this to ring an alarm in Jewish life and to tell non-Jewish America that these people represent leftism, not Judaism. Furthermore, I am talking only about leftist Jews, not liberal Jews. Unfortunately, however, liberalism has become synonymous with leftism both within and outside Judaism.This past week, the embarrassing behavior of left-wing Jews reached a new level.The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Jews and their clergy at various synagogues around America were gathering to sit shiva — the Hebrew and Jewish term for the seven-day period of grieving that Jews engage in after the loss of an immediate relative — because Donald Trump was elected president.Consider for a moment how childish and narcissistic this is, using the sacred ritual reserved for the death of one's child or parent as a way to express disappointment over a presidential election.And of course, there were the irresponsible, over-the-top outbursts by Jewish columnists and academics. Take Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who devoted his column after the election to writing an open letter to his 12-year-old daughter.""As I watched the returns at Donald Trump's celebration here Tuesday night,"" Milbank began, ""the hardest part was trying to reassure my seventh-grade daughter at home, via phone and text, that she would be okay.""She had expected to be celebrating the election of the first female president, but instead, this man she had been reading and hearing horrible things about had won.""The man's 12-year-old daughter ""feared her own world could come apart"" because of the election result. He reassured her, however, that her world would be fine, especially since she would be receiving so much love at her upcoming bat mitzvah.Milbank's daughter's trauma was more than matched by the reaction of a Jewish adult, Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine. On Nov. 8, he tweeted, ""This is the worst thing that has happened in my life.""Chait was 31 years old on 9/11.A response to his tweet by a woman named Bethany S. Mandel pretty well summarized the maturity level of Chait's comment. She said: ""I took my mom off life support at 16 & dad hanged himself 3 yrs later. I'm sorry this election was so hard for you.""I am sure Ms. Mandel would join me in paying Mr. Chait a shiva call.Speaking of 9/11, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman said on Bill Maher's show that Trump's victory is ""a moral 9/11."" He suggested that Trump becoming president might be worse than 9/11, for 9/11 happened to us, but ""we did this to ourselves.""Paul Krugman, Friedman's colleague at The New York Times, wrote that he now realizes that he ""truly didn't understand the country we live in."" Never have truer words been written. It's tough to understand those for whom you only have contempt.Add similar comments made during the election by other Jewish leftists in the media and academia, and you get the picture.How are we to understand this?Here's one explanation: When Jews abandoned Judaism, many of them did not abandon Judaism's messianic impulse. From Karl Marx — the grandson of two Orthodox rabbis — and onwards, they simply secularized it and created secular substitutes, such as Marxism, humanism, socialism, feminism and environmentalism.If left-wing Jews want to sit shiva, they should do so for their religion, which, like much of Protestant Christianity and Roman Catholicism, has been so deeply and negatively influenced by leftism.RELATED:To Democrats' Dismay, Trump Will Inherit Obama's Enhanced Presidential PowersWhen Elections Never End: How To Stop The Permanent Campaign And Avoid Civil WarVictor Davis Hanson: Thanks To Obama, Next President Will Be UnboundThe Senate: The Most Important Reason Why Your Vote Matters

288,MS,"Riding a spike in Treasury yields, bank stocks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) rose to their highest levels in years, continuing their gains since Donald Trump's unexpected election last week.JPMorgan jumped 3.7% in the stock market today, after hitting a record high last week. Bank of America rose 5.6% to levels not seen since 2008. Citigroup (C) advanced 3.5%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) gained 2.2%.Goldman Sachs (GS) was up 2.6%, while Morgan Stanley (MS) added 2.2%. U.S. Bancorp (USB) rose 1.7%, KeyCorp (KEY) 2.8% and PNC Financial Services (PNC) 2%.Home Bancorp (HOMB), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and East West Bancorp (EWBC) are among the many other banking stocks extending powerful gains.Those stocks are all well past buy range, but could still maintain strength and present buying opportunities in the event of a correction.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes leapt 10 basis points to 2.25%, continuing huge gains since last week. SPDR Financial (XLF) an ETF whose investments include a variety of financial stocks, rose 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Ever since President-elect Trump last vowed to improve the nation's infrastructure, investors have renewed their focus on the stocks that could benefit. Here's a broader look at what stocks could drive a potential bull market in the Trump era.The rising yields come as investors anticipate stronger growth and higher inflation due to Trump's plans for tax cuts a wave of new public infrastructure spending. Markets are also betting that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, with perhaps more tightening in 2017.Short-end Treasury yields also have risen sharply since the election and in recent weeks, but not nearly as much as the long end. That means banks, which borrow short and lend long, should see higher profitability.Banks could also benefit from fewer regulations under a Trump administration.RELATED:Profit Recession Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014Banks ETFs Rise To Build On Trump Windfall, At Best Level Since 2008JPMorgan Hits Record As Banks Extend Gains; CEO Dimon At Treasury?U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

291,MS,"Things are breaking in favor of manager Joseph Fath and the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) he manages. The $44.6 billion portfolio was outperforming 98% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the three months, going into Thursday.That could help lift the mutual fund, which has been roughly in the middle of the pack so far this year, back to its longer-term record of outperformance, as Fath approaches his three-year anniversary at the helm in January.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain of 9.53% has topped 85% of its peers, which averaged 7.37% yearly. The S&P 500 notched a 9.18% annual pace.The fund's recent rally stems from the market's rotation back toward the type of growth stocks that Fath favors. Earlier in the year, the market was rewarding deep cyclical stocks. ""That's not an area we play,"" Fath said.Fath prefers stocks with superior growth in earnings and cash flow, in good times or bad.The fund's long-term success has made it one of IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds accomplished that. And it was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all growth funds and all large caps.How is the fund managing this rebound? Eight of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings of 83 or better. Five of its top 10 new buys also had Comp Ratings of at least 83.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.MasterCard (MA) is one the fund's top holdings. It has trended higher since early July, and it did well on Wednesday, the first day after Donald Trump's election victory. But it pulled back on Thursday, finishing 4% below its all-time high.Illinois Tool Works (ITW) is among the fund's top buys. The stock has rallied this month, adding 8% this week. Many investors look at it as a way to benefit from investments in U.S. infrastructure under a Trump administration. Fath instead is focused on the stock's ongoing fundamentals, not its potential macroeconomic drivers.""It's more of a mergers-and-acquisitions story within industrials,"" he said. ""And it is a disciplined, well-run company with seven business units. They're all doing well, all pushing margin structure over 20%. Only the welding unit is under pressure.""Fath added that the company management has executed ""good deployment of capital. They've gotten rid of bad stuff, focused on their best stuff and made good deals in recent years.""Another of his holdings, Martin Marietta (MLM), is more of a Trump infrastructure play, he says. The stock, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, gapped up 12% on Wednesday on massive volume and was up again Thursday. That puts Martin Marietta shares above the level at which you'd want to buy them under CAN SLIM rules.IBD'S TAKE: CAN SLIM rules establish buy ranges above buy points to keep investors from ""chasing"" stocks beyond low-risk buy zones. Leading stocks executing powerful gap-up breakouts operate according to a slightly different set of rules.The company produces crushed stone, and an other aggregates for construction.Earnings per share grew 886%, 56% and 22% the past three quarters.The company stands to benefit from programs like the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program, which is a commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments entering the United States from Canada and Mexico. ""(Those programs) have been slow to roll out but are ramping up now,"" he said.Also, Fath sees the company's low single-digit volume and high single-digit pricing as set to recover into high single-digit growth as the heavy rain and flooding in the Southeast that hurt them earlier this year have passed.Many investors expect certain financial stocks to benefit from a lighter regulatory burden during a Trump regime as well as from a rising-rate environment. Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 7% on Wednesday and was up again Thursday.Trading around 38, that left the big financial firm's shares extended above their 32.47 buy point.""(A bullish outlook for a) lot of financials is predicated on a rising-rate environment,"" Fath said. ""We think Morgan Stanley is a good company-specific story.""Fath likes Morgan Stanley's heightened focus on wealth management.And the company's bank is becoming a bigger source of income and profit as the firm does more lending.Ferrari (RACE) is another holding that Fath likes. The Italy-based sports- and luxury-car maker was spun off from Fiat just over a year ago.""This stock does not get a lot of attention,"" Fath said. ""European car analysts follow it. But it is really a luxury goods company. It does not have a lot of capital requirements and it does have a lot of demand backlog.""The company enjoys production growth of roughly 4% a year, Fath says. And it has annual pricing power of about 3% to 5%.""This is a company that can grow in the midteens for the rest of the decade,"" Fath said. ""Other luxury goods makers like Hermes trade at much higher multiples. In today's market, we like a company that can be defensive as well as offensive.""Generally, superwealthy consumers don't downshift their car buying even during a time of slow or uncertain economic growth, Fath says.RELATED:Franklin's DynaTech Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWhat Fidelity Trend Fund Likes About Apple, Amazon and Alphabet

Gorman said in June that the fixed-income and commodities business is capable of generating $4 billion in annual revenue even after being scaled back, which included a decision to cut 25% of the division's staff last year.""Our expense initiatives remain on track,"" Gorman said in the statement. ""Overall the results reflect steady progress against our long-term strategic goals.""Fixed-income trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $1 billion.

But Teva stock is down 22% since May on investor worry that generics will sock Copaxone sales in 2017.""Given the sell-off in Teva shares since May, we feel most of the risk around Copaxone and the U.S. generics market is now priced into the shares,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday in a research report outlining ""some tricks ahead"" but calling the valuation ""a treat.""Divan upgraded Teva stock to outperform from a neutral, seeing long-term opportunities, but he cut his price target to 52 from 59 on looming competition. Mylan (MYL) is expected to release a 20-milligram generic competitor to Copaxone in 2017 as others prep 40-mg versions.He said potential ""tricks"" from Teva in the near term include its Q3 earnings report on Nov. 15. At that time, he expects the company to lower its guidance to reflect a court decision on Teva's Copaxone patent.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of generic drugmakers are down 25% for the year, but other medical firms are flourishing despite the volatile election season. Glaukos stock, for instance, is up 32% for the year — though its main ""trick"" might not seem like much of a ""treat."" Check out IBD's New America for more.The Q3 conference call might offer some clarity on Teva's acquisition of Actavis and upcoming catalysts including phase-three data for chronic migraine drug TEV-48125 and the likelihood of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a Huntington Disease medication in early 2017.""For generics we believe drug pricing deflation will remain in the expected range while Teva will be able to take advantage of some first-to-file opportunities, extract synergies from the Actavis deal and begin delivering meaningful margin expansion,"" Divan wrote in a research note.In the stock market today, Teva stock rose 0.83% to 42.67, but it's still trading near three-year lows. IBD's 18-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell nearly 2% Monday to a nearly four-month low. The group is ranked No. 113 out of 197 groups tracked.RELATED:Mylan Jumps As DOJ Settlement Removes 'Lingering Concerns'Amgen Migraine Drug Likely To Beat Eli Lilly, Alder, Teva To Market

296,MS,"The major indexes continued to yo-yo back and forth with an hour left in Thursday's session. But small caps continued to sell off hard.The Russell 2000 dropped more than 1%, topping a 0.9% slide on Wednesday. In contrast, the Dow Jones industrials poked slightly lower despite solid gains by components such as IBM (IBM), DuPont (DD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).DuPont, up 1.8% to 69.89, is approaching a cup with long handle entry at 71.19, which is not far below the cup's left-side high of 75.72.The S&P 500 was off a bit more than 0.1%. The Nasdaq fell 0.5%. But the S&P 100, which houses the 100 largest firms by market cap, was up slightly. Volume was running more than 10% higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time Wednesday.While real estate-related plays slumped in the stock market today, banks attracted more buying as the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond rose to almost 1.85%. Higher interest rates generally enable lenders to expand their profit margins in loan products.Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), another Dow 30 component, rose nearly 0.8% to 69.57 in dull volume. The stock continues to rise further past a 65.08 buy point in a narrow cup with handle pattern, built within a much larger base structure. An investor could have also bought shares when JPMorgan cleared a secondary handle at 66.58. From that second buy point, the 5% permissible buy zone extends up to 69.91.JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley (MS) was up nearly 1% to 33.89, rising nearly 3% past a 32.47 entry in a bottoming-style cup with handle base.Super-regionals are also rallying. SunTrust (STI) of Atlanta rallied nearly 1% to 45.97, up more than 3% past a cup with long handle entry at 44.42, before easing some. The 5% chase zone goes up to 46.64.SunTrust, which last week reported another quarter of single-digit top and bottom-line growth, boasts ultrareliable profitability and a 2.3% annualized dividend, better than the S&P 500's 2.11% yield as of Wednesday's close.SunTrust scores an excellent three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 on a scale of zero (stable) to 99 (wild). Steady profits give corporate boards the confidence to raise or maintain cash payouts to shareholders.IBD's super-regional banking group is up 1.2% so far in the stock market today. Also pacing the upside were the ship transport, trucking, water supply utility, education and dairy products industry groups, each up 1% or more.IBD'S TAKE: The cup with handle base is one of the most important chart patterns that an investor can learn to time their buys of great stocks.

298,MS,"Stocks shaved a small chunk of their intraday losses with an hour left in Wednesday's session. Bargain hunters swooped in after the Federal Reserve announced -- without surprise to investors -- no change in the fed funds rate it charges on overnight loans to Wall Street banks.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, showed its mettle with a nearly 0.5% gain to 111.40, holding mildly above a 110.33 cup with handle breakout point.However, two members of the policy committee, Esther George of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank and Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed, voted against the action, as they both argued instead for a 25-basis-point hike in the rate. The current fed funds rate is in a target range of 0.25% to 0.5%.The Nasdaq composite, down as much as 0.9% just after 2 p.m. ET, cut the loss to around 0.7%.The S&P 500 rebounded to trade less than 0.5% lower. The 2100 level may be acting as a support level, but the 50-day moving average, which has been sloping lower for nearly four weeks, continues to cap the large-cap index's recent rally attempts.The Dow Jones industrials is outperforming the other key indexes, down less than 0.3% and getting a boost by a 1.1% gain by 3M (MMM) as well as modest gains from Apple and Home Depot (HD). Small caps continued to bleed more red, with the Russell 2000 down nearly 1%.Fellow Dow 30 component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) cut early losses and was down just 0.4% at 68.69, up from a recent breakout from a bottoming base at 65.08.The 65.08 entry derives from adding 10 cents to a handle that formed on a long cup base. Last month, the Wall Street bank and consumer lending institution reported its best quarter in years as earnings grew 20% on a 10% revenue jump.JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley (MS) was off 1.4% to 32.89, still up 1% past a 32.47 handle buy point, while Citigroup (C), down 0.9% in slow turnover to 48.49, was clinging to minute gains from a breakout at 48.28.Apple initially broke out on Sept. 14 and gained nearly 8% before pulling back. So far, the decline appears normal, particularly during a stock market as choppy as today.The iPhone company has benefited by a tragic misstep by rival Samsung Electronic in its battery problems with the Galaxy Note big-format smartphone, which the South Korean company has decided to discontinue.Apple has unveiled a new refresh of its Macbook computers that have a new touch bar feature at the top of the keyboard, making it easy for users to apply emoji icons and other commands into emails and messages. Apple watchers are also speculating that next year's iPhone 8 will include new features such as wireless charging. In other words, the company continues to innovate relentlessly.Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings in the December-ending first quarter to decline just 2% to $3.22 a share, an improvement from year-over-year declines of -18%, -23% and -15% in the prior three quarters.Also in the stock market today, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continues to slump after holding in a range of 190 to 215 for months. The stock fell 1% to 188.90 and is near taking out its June 27 low of 187.87.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) sold off, gapping down at the open and falling more than 12% and hit as low as 149.21 before rebounding a tad. The former growth stock leader saw turnover surge more than six times usual levels and gave back all of its gains since an Aug. 3 breakout sent the stock past a 152.83 double bottom with handle buy point.The fuel card technology firm, serving the trucking industry, posted a 15% increase in earnings to $1.92 a share, narrowly edging the Street's view, as revenue rose 7% to $484.4 million. Perhaps the recent fall in crude oil prices are dampening investors' expectation of future demand for FleetCor's fuel cost efficiency-boosting services.RELATED:Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged, Awaits 'Further Evidence'What Is The Bottoming Base Chart Pattern, And How Does Help Investors Make Money?When Did Citigroup Break Out?When Was The Right Time To Buy Apple Shares?

299,MS,"U.S. stocks inched up in early trade Monday morning as the market tried to end four losing sessions in a row.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each added 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and the small cap Russell 2000 were flat. Volume in the stock market today was running below average on both major exchanges. Volume was above average Thursday and Friday on the Nasdaq. The above-average volume coincided with the Nasdaq's moves below its 50-day moving average line, not a good sign.Chevron (CVX) bounced 1.4% higher early Monday, adding to Friday's 4% pop on an 84% earnings beat for the third quarter. Chevron rose despite a 1.5% drop in the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil.Banks continued to show strength. Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) all were up in early action.In economic news, consumer spending for September matched expectations with a 0.5% increase. But personal income grew at 0.3%, falling shy of views for 0.4%, according to Econoday.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for October checked in at 50.6 — a bad miss for the business barometer, which failed to match even the lowest estimate in the range. The Street expected 54.3, and the lowest estimate in the range was 53.1. The 50.6 reading was a five-month low for the manufacturing gauge.

300,MS,"The stock market opened mixed but turned modestly higher early Wednesday, as oil stocks rallied and earnings from Morgan Stanley (MS) and other major companies influenced early trading.The Nasdaq erased tiny losses to rise about 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% while the S&P 500 held a 0.3% gain.  Volume was tracking slightly lower across the board.The energy sector led as the price of U.S. crude futures rose more than 3% $51.87 a barrel on lower U.S. inventories and signs of declining output in China. Drilling, exploration oilfield services and oil machinery were among the oil & gas industry groups in the top 10 of today's trading.Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) followed through on yesterday's breakout, adding almost 1% in heavy volume.Earnings continue to sway Wall Street, as some major financial, technology and health care companies were on the day's docket.Morgan Stanley climbed nearly 1% after the bank beat profit expectations. It was the latest investor-pleasing quarterly report from the major banks. Revenue also topped views, as a surge in bond trading helped the quarter. The stock is slightly above a 32.47 buy point.Intel (INTC) slid nearly 6%, erasing all gains from the 36.03 buy point of a breakout in early September. It also gapped below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, which puts the stock in a perilous position. The chipmaker's guidance was weak when it reported Q3 results late Tuesday.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) fell nearly  4% despite that the company's Q3 sales and earnings beat expectations. Operating earnings were $6.19 a share, up 18%, on revenue of $683 million, an increase of 16%. The stock slid as much as 5.5% below a 720.10 buy point, from which Intuitive had difficulty climbing. The stock also pierced its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, leaving shares compromised.On Wednesday, Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills raised his price target to 800 from 750. He cited expanding margins, increases in procedures and a spike in revenue per procedure.IBD's homebuilding industry  group edged up 0.1% but other construction-related industry groups fell after a mixed industry report.Housing starts of an annualized 1.047 million in September were down 9%,  to the slowest pace since March 2015. Economists had expected a slight increase to a 1.18 million pace. But the drop was due to volatile multifamily starts. Single-family starts jumped 8.1% in September, the highest since February. Building permits, a gauge of future activity, climbed 6.3% to a 1.225 million pace. That's the highest since November.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Profit Soars As Bond-Trading Revenue SurgesIntel Investors Cash In Their Chips As Guidance DisappointsHousing Starts Dive 9% To 18-Month Low, But Single-Family Activity Strong

303,MS,"Stocks edged higher by noon time in New York on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in the oil patch. Banking and restaurant names also gained ground. Small caps outperformed.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) advanced 1.5% to 175.20 in heavy turnover as it broke out of a long, deep double bottom with a 172.52 buy point.The Nasdaq composite erased small early-morning gains to practically break-even levels. At 5244, the tech-rich index is still around 5 points shy of retaking its critical 50-day moving average.The NYSE composite gained nearly 0.4% as oil drilling, steel, oil and gas field services, super regional bank and money center bank stocks paced the upside. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher.

After two sell-offs that led to two lows of 139.05 and 138.20 in February and June, respectively, the stock made an impressive rebound during the summer as Federal Reserve officials began warming up more to the idea of raising interest rates again in a gradual manner.Goldman posted a strong third quarter on Tuesday as earnings rocketed 68% to $4.88 a share on reported revenue of $8.2 billion. The bank saw assets under supervision rising to a record $1.35 trillion, including net inflows of $14 billion in long-term assets. Investment banking net revenue was virtually flat, while securities underwriting revenue grew 18%, thanks in large part to debt deals.The permissible buy zone in Goldman shares goes up to 5% past the proper 172.52 entry, or 181.15. Buying higher than that price can subject an investor to taking a fast loss if the stock stages a normal pullback following a breakout. As many as four out of 10 great stocks will ease back to or near the proper breakout level before rebounding.Goldman rival Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 1% to 32.57, edging past a 32.47 entry in a long cup with handle after reporting strong Q3 earnings of 80 cents a share, up 135% on a 14% climb in revenue. The earnings growth was boosted partly by an easy comparison; in the third quarter a year ago, profit slumped 52%.Also in the stock market today, the energy sector still ranks in the bottom half of IBD's daily ranking of 33 broad sectors at No. 20. Yet the gigantic sector is seeing pockets of strength.Parsley Energy (PE) jumped 3% to 37.10, good for a new high in heavy turnover. The oil and gas explorer is extended following multiple tests of support at or near its 50-day moving average since May.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) stretched its gains after robust Q3 results issued on Tuesday.

Pfizer announced a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to conduct phase 1 & 2 clinical trials for its vaccine candidate against group B Streptococcus, a treatment for neonatal blood infections.At the Dow's low end, Intel (INTC) dropped 5% after its late Tuesday report showed third-quarter earnings and revenue met the company's preannounced levels, but management's Q4 revenue guidance was just shy of consensus estimates. Intel shares have gained 28% since early May, ending Tuesday's session in a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Vitamin and nutrition supplement supplier GNC Holdings (GNC) popped 5% on news reports that the company had been shopping for possible buyers in China.

314,MS,"Viacom (VIAB) has reportedly hired Morgan Stanley (MS) to explore a CBS (CBS) merger, as Alibaba (BABA) -- once rumored to be interested in Viacom's studio arm — ties up with Amblin instead.The MTV and Comedy Central parent hired the bank and will also bring on a second financial advisor, said the Wall Street Journal late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The outlet's sources said that CBS, which is currently retaining Lazard, might also hire more financial and legal advisors.The move follows Sumner Redstone's National Amusements publicly calling on both companies late last month to consider an all-stock combination. National Amusements controls about 80% of both Viacom and CBS' voting shares.Meanwhile, Alibaba's studio arm and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners said Saturday that they will coproduce and finance movies for global and Chinese audiences, with Alibaba Pictures acquiring a minority equity stake in Amblin Partners. Amblin will also welcome an Alibaba representative to its board of directors.Amid the wheeling and dealing, the fate of Paramount Pictures, which could be a key sticking point in any Viacom-CBS merger, remains unclear.Earlier in the summer, Alibaba's Jack Ma and Viacom's Shari Redstone reportedly met up to discuss a potential sale of the media conglomerate's studio arm, according to the New York Post.

315,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS), once the most profitable firm on Wall Street, reported a 47% increase in third-quarter earnings as revenue from bond trading surpassed analysts' predictions.Net income rose to $2.09 billion, or $4.88 a share, from $1.43 billion, or $2.90, a year earlier, the New York-based company said in a statement Tuesday.Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 62, has cut jobs, given responsibility to more junior employees and lowered compensation to reduce expenses and preserve flexibility to ramp up trading when activity returned. This quarter shows the benefit of the strategy, which attracted some skepticism among analysts as competitors such as Morgan Stanley (MS) decided to retreat instead.""We saw solid performance across the franchise that helped counter typical seasonal weakness,"" Blankfein said in the statement.Fixed-income trading revenue rose to $1.96 billion, beating the $1.7 billion estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equities-trading revenue of $1.78 billion surpassed the $1.69 billion estimate. The sales-and-trading division is overseen by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan.The bank is battling sluggish revenue prospects and trying to show investors it can generate a return on equity above its cost of capital after years of returns often in excess of 20 percent were the envy of the industry.Goldman Sachs enacted at least four rounds of job reductions in New York this year that accounted for more than 400 dismissals. It also extended cuts in its fixed-income division to roughly 10% of staff, double what it normally culls each year, and eliminated dozens of managing directors, executive directors and vice presidents across the mergers and debt and equity capital-markets teams.In recent weeks, Goldman Sachs has reduced its projection for job cuts in Asia. The firm now intends to trim about 15% of its investment-banking jobs in Asia outside Japan, fewer than the 25%, or 75 positions, initially considered last month, a person with knowledge of the matter said Monday.The company has also sought to develop new businesses to help generate revenue and boost returns. The bank this month began offering loans through its online-lending platform Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which offers unsecured consumer loans to creditworthy borrowers. It also has an online deposit-taking franchise that it purchased from General Electric (GE). this year. Consumers can open a savings account there with as little as $1.Goldman Sachs's stock slumped 6.2% this year through Monday, lagging behind the 0.2% drop for the S&P 500 Financials Index.Goldman Sachs is the fifth of the six biggest U.S. banks to report results, with Morgan Stanley set to announce earnings on Wednesday.

318,MS,"Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday said it was too early to gauge the long-term financial impact of the sham-account scandal, but its dividend, which has made the stock attractive over the years, appears intact even as regulatory scrutiny intensifies.When asked by an analyst during a conference call if the potential litigation and government investigations that Wells Fargo faces will affect its capital return plans, Tim Sloan, the bank's new CEO, said, ""Overall, it doesn't.""Specifics were scarce about customer retention and the long-term financial impact of the scandal, which prompted the resignation of its CEO, damaged its reputation and raised questions about the sales practices at other banks. (JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) CFO on Friday said it had found some cross-selling issues but ""no systemic issues"" as it investigates its own sales methods.)Still, some early indications trickled out. While Wells Fargo said that overall customer traffic to bank branches and call centers had held at ""typical"" levels for September, the month when news first broke of the fine, other metrics saw declines.Customer checking-account openings fell 25% during September, while credit-card applications sank 20% and customer visits with branch bankers were down 10%, the company said.""Customer visits with bankers, account openings and applications were down on lower referrals, marketing activity and product offerings,"" Wells Fargo said in its earnings presentation.It added: ""Customer experience scores trended down but were in line with historic performance.""The bank said that shifting more staff to its corporate-risk functions in the wake of the scandal could cost ""tens of millions of dollars.""Shares of Wells Fargo dipped 0.1% to 44.71 in the stock market today, despite strong Q3 results. JPMorgan and Citigroup (C), which also topped Q3 forecasts, fell 0.3% and by 2 cents, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis.During the call, Wells Fargo again expressed regret over the scandal, in which authorities said that members of its sales staff created as many as 2 million unauthorized or sham accounts in an attempt to hit sales targets.Wells Fargo in September was hit with a $185 million fine as a result. The bank's former CEO, John Stumpf, faced a grilling before Congress afterward.Management on Friday outlined a variety of measures intended to strengthen the verification process and said ""all good ideas"" were on the table in an attempt to right the company's course. The bank this month ended product-sales goals in retail banking and said it refunded $2.6 million to customers for any fees related to potentially unapproved credit-card and deposit accounts.Buried underneath all of the discussion of the scandal, however, was a solid quarter. Earnings per share of $1.03 topped views for $1.01 on revenue of $22.33 billion, above estimates for $22.2 billion.""The other businesses that drive this company performed quite well in the quarter, and we're excited about their growth,"" Sloan said.Community banking revenue edged up 1% to $12.4 billion. Wholesale banking revenue dipped 2% to $7.1 billion. Wealth and investment management revenue climbed 5% to $4.1 billion.The trends in Wells' underlying business were similar to Q2, Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told IBD: Low interest rates offset by loan growth; healthy credit quality; weakness in its energy portfolio that could subside as oil prices rebound.Strong bond trading, meanwhile, lifted JPMorgan and Citigroup.JPMorgan's Q3 EPS of $1.58 topped views for $1.39, while revenue of $25.51 billion also beat. Markets and investor services revenue jumped 20.5% to $6.5 billion, with fixed-income market revenue up 48%. Investment banking revenue rose 6% to $2.9 billion.Citigroup's Q3 EPS of $1.24 beat views for $1.15, while revenue of $17.76 billion topped estimates for $17.34 billion. Fixed income revenue jumped 35% to $3.47 billion. Markets and securities revenue climbed 11.6% to $4.53 billion.Citigroup last month noted better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking.Next week, Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) all report earnings.Those banks could also face questions about their sales staffs' practices in attempting to get more consumers to buy more diverse products. Wells Fargo said its shift to a more service-oriented model could take some time and that conditions could get worse before they get better.""What will it look like?"" Stemm wondered.

319,MS,"Banks retreated Thursday, testing buy points as Treasury yields fell ahead of earnings from Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) out Friday.Treasury yields were down Thursday after a weaker-than-expected trade report out of China sent investors toward government bonds and other safe assets. Investors have bid financials in recent weeks on the prospect of Federal Reserve rate hikes and the recent rise of long-term yields around the world.

"
321,MS,"Stocks remained firmly in the upside during afternoon trading on Wednesday as a wide array of sectors participated -- even the beleaguered banking sector. Citigroup (C) surged more than 2% to stage a rare breakout, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) marched further above a recent buy point at 66.58.Small caps, meanwhile, led the way. The Russell 2000 gained more than 1%, trumping the S&P 500's nearly 0.5% lift.The Nasdaq composite -- bolstered by strength in internet, chip and software stocks (think names such as data network security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which is building a new base) -- rose more than 0.6%, as did the big- and mega-cap-centered Dow Jones industrials.Fiber-optic telecom, oil and gas, banking and some retailing stocks led the upside, offsetting losses by gold mining, REIT, dairy product and tobacco issues.Some tech names fell hard, but did not trigger any sell signals. For instance, IBD 50 name Gigamon (GIMO) dropped nearly 6% to 51.87 on some analyst valuation-based downgrades, but rebounded off its intraday low. The maker of network security appliances is still above a recent 47.06 pivot point within a tight, flat base-like structure.Watch to see if the S&P 500 can continue to recoup its losses from Monday and Tuesday and jump back above the 50-day moving average. In healthy market rallies, the key indexes traverse on the north side of this intermediate-term trend indicator.Volume was flat vs. the same time on Tuesday on the Nasdaq and mildly lower on the NYSE. Higher volume at the close would be a bullish sign, meaning that equity trading desks hungered to accumulate stocks.Wall Street banks have floundered for years as Congress has imposed tight regulations and the Federal Reserve have kept the cost of money near zero for the longest time in modern history. Yet a steady stream of data points showing the U.S. economy is not dead, along with the prospect of a minor increase in the fed funds rate after the Nov. 8 presidential election, has some investors anticipating improved profitability for even the largest investment banks.Citigroup and JPMorgan epitomize commercial and investment banking with their extensive network of branches and offices around the globe. Both are also key players in consumer and mortgage loans. So the possibility that both banks may see profit margins expand in their interest-rate-sensitive products may be helping to boost demand for shares.IBD'S TAKE: Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are in buy range. See which other bank stocks have broken out on Federal Reserve rate hike buzz this week.Citi hit as high as 48.85 intraday and rushed past a 48.28 buy point within an 11-month cup with handle. That's quite long for this bullish pattern, since the minimum length must be seven weeks. Yet Citi's base shows some positive characteristics. One, the base passes the midpoint test in which the handle's midpoint of 46.67 exceeds the cup's midpoint of 45.49 (take the intraday high of the cup plus the intraday low, and divide by 2).Two, the right side of the bottoming base features strong price gains in above-average volume, including June 29 (one day before the market's rare Day 3 follow-through) and on Aug. 5. These instances are subtle chart clues that fund managers are quietly buying shares.Three, Citi has now climbed back above its 50- and 200-day lines, and its RS Rating of 58, while still on the shabby side overall, is actually not bad considering that the stock has been basing for a long time.In the same IBD money center bank group, JPMorgan hosts a higher RS Rating at 67, and so do Bank of Montreal (BMO) (RS 61), Royal Bank of Canada (RY) (64), Bank of America (BAC) (73) and Morgan Stanley (MS) (the highest in the bunch at 80). Go to IBD Stock Checkup, and you'll see that Morgan Stanley also shows a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B; a C+ grade or higher hints at net institutional share accumulation in a stock over the past 13 weeks.Elsewhere in the stock market today, leading oil explorers captured more gains following a big jump in crude oil futures. WTI near-term prices rose more than 2% to nearly eclipse $50 a barrel on news that U.S. inventories fell again for a fifth straight week.Parsley Energy (PE) jumped more than 3% to 35.26, clearing a narrow tight consolidation in heavy volume. The Permian Basin play also showed strong buying support during last week's test of the 50-day moving average.Parsley sports an excellent Composite Rating of 95 out of a maximum 99. The stock has rallied more than 70% since first clearing a first-stage base at 20.43 in the week ended March 11.RELATED:U.S. Crude Nears $50 As Stockpiles Fall For Fifth Straight WeekHighflier Gigamon Too High, Analysts Say In Valuation DowngradesMaster The Art Of Spotting A Bottoming Base

It's actually been easier to make buys of growth-oriented stocks that were beaten down earlier this year, he adds.The fund added to health care names Biogen (BIIB) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) as well as consumer cyclical Alibaba Group (BABA) in recent portfolio reports.""Biogen is transitioning toward a new phase of growth,"" Wilson said. That's happening amid maturation in the market for the company's multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs. The company is looking more toward its pipeline of new treatments. And Wilson likes the company's newfound fiscal discipline, imposed by new managers.""The company is going through a management transition, which we're constructive on,"" Wilson said. ""They are trying to spend research-and-development dollars in a more focused fashion.""That focus makes their pipeline of new products interesting, he says, including possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease.Wilson and his colleagues also like developments at Edwards. ""They are very innovative, and have a lead position in a new market with their product that allows minimally invasive (heart) valve replacement surgery.""Edwards' transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) had been approved only for high-risk patients. Wilson says that in the last year TAVR was approved for use with intermediate-risk patients, which is a larger market. TAVR is an alternative to more expensive, less effective treatments, Wilson adds. TAVR treatment is still in the early stages of adoption by physicians and patients, he says.As for Alibaba, Wilson says he is not fazed by the stock's sell-off in recent days. That pullback reflects investors' concerns over weak economic data about China overall, not Alibaba in particular. ""We have a long-term view,"" he said. ""The company is well-positioned in terms of market presence and ability to monetize the emerging Chinese online consumer.""The company has several online sales platforms as well as a cloud services arm. Also, Wilson likes Alibaba's development of a new service that will offer live online demonstrations of products.Columbia Large Cap Growth's biggest sector weighting is in technology. It had 29% of its shareholders' money at work there as of Aug. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. That was overweight vs. both the fund's Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark and the S&P 500.""When you look at what's driving a lot of innovation, a lot of those drivers are in technology,"" Wilson said. The fund's holdings are spread among names related to the internet, semiconductors, cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SAAS), he adds.Holdings included Facebook (FB).Amazon.com (AMZN) (classified as a consumer cyclical by many investors) and Facebook were the fund's two top holdings overall as of June 30, accounting for nearly 8% of fund assets.The two are also on IBD's Leaderboard.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook, Amazon and other highly rated stocks like them are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.Wilson likes the prospects for Facebook's Messenger app and WhatsApp (another messaging app) to some day feature advertising. He also likes Facebook's new Live, ""which basically uses the Facebook platform to broadcast live events."" All three services have monetization potential, which would boost Facebook's bottom line, Wilson says.Facebook's earnings per share growth has sped up for four quarters in a row. Most recently it was 94%.Amazon has racked up five straight quarters of triple-digit earnings per share growth. That reversed four stanzas of slowing growth.""The company has two businesses,"" Wilson said. ""The biggest is its retail operation. The second is its web services, which is providing the backbone for a lot of information technology systems in the cloud. Revenue is growing more than 50% annually. And Amazon is the leader in that space by a wide margin.""Portfolio positioning today determines how successful the managers will be in resuming their long-term outperformance. The fund's average annual gains of 11.05% and 14.75% ranked in the top 11% and 15% of their peers tracked by Morningstar over the past three and five years, going into Thursday.And for beating the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year spans that ended Dec. 31 -- a feat achieved by just 9% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds -- the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner.Year-to-date, the fund's 0.90% gain trails 68% of its direct rivals as well as the S&P 500's 6.47% advance.RELATED:Why This IBD 'Best Mutual Fund' Bets On Amazon, Broadcom, PricelineEllie Mae, Red Hat, ServiceNow Flex Muscle In Leading Software SectorHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With Giddyap

323,MS,"Argentina-based e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI), often called the eBay of Latin America, late Wednesday announced a secondary stock offering on behalf of shareholders eBay (EBAY) and an eBay subsidiary, sending shares of MercadoLibre falling in after-hours trading.EBay is offering 5.5 million of its shares. Underwriters Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan (JPM) have an option to purchase an additional 825,000 from eBay. MercadoLibre will not receive any proceeds.IBD'S TAKE: What initial public offerings have done the best? The list longer includes Acacia Communications, but you get learn who they are, ranked by performance, at IBD's IPO Leaders.As of Dec. 31, eBay owned 8.1 million shares of MercadoLibre, or an 18.4% stake, making it MercardoLibre's largest shareholder.No offering price was estimated yet, but MercadoLibre stock closed Wednesday's regular session at 183.21. In its most recent 10-K regulatory filing, eBay said the fair market value of its equity holdings came to $929 million, or about 10% of its cash and investments, and it said MercadoLibre shares made up most of those holdings.MercadoLibre's U.S. shares were down 6% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company announced the follow-on offering.Recent hot IPOs Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Twilio (TWLO) tumbled recently on plans for follow-on stock offerings mostly or partly on behalf of existing shareholders. Acacia on Friday priced its $450 million offering — with $325 million on behalf of existing shareholders — at $100 per share. Since then, Acacia stock has fallen 19% to a two-month low of 88.46.Twilio plummeted 14% Monday on its announcement of a secondary offering to consist of $50 million in shares on behalf of the company and a still-undetermined stake to be sold by selling shareholders.RELATED:Acacia Communications Tumbles On Secondary OfferingTwilio Has Worst Day Ever On Stock-Sale Plan

324,MS,"With JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday, the landscape for the big banks has enough in common with what we saw in Q2.In other words, the Fed still opted not to raise interest rates, hurting the banks' net interest margins. The state of the U.S. consumer remained generally solid. And the global ""economic uncertainty?"" That was still there too.""During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The only good news some analysts see is no bad news.""Unfortunately, the positive might come in just not having any negatives,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said.But Citigroup last month cited better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking, while JPMorgan remained upbeat on the economy and the state of the consumer.Other factors will be likely to dominate the financial world's attention. Many observers will likely be cued into any commentary surrounding Wells Fargo's cross-selling scandal — in which authorities said the bank's employees created as many as 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to hit sales targets.The scandal has cost John Stumpf his job as CEO and chairman. The bank said late Wednesday COO Tim Sloan is taking over as CEO and Stephen Sanger is taking over as chair.The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank outlined plans to rebound from the scandal during a conference call on Monday. Details from those plans could be presented on Friday.The scandal over the bank's cross-selling, a point of pride for management only a few years ago, led to some intense questioning from Congress about the bank's culture and executives' knowledge of the sales practices. The financial impact during Q3, however, was limited.Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's earnings per share to fall 4% to $1.01. Revenue is seen rising 1.5% to $22.2 billion.""The investment community's going to be looking for some specifics from the management team on what they're going to do to adjust sales practices, and what's that going to look like from a cost standpoint?"" Stemm said.""And then I think there will be follow-ons to some of the other banks, too – 'What do your sales practices look like? What are you doing to monitor both risky behavior?' What does that look like for future compliance costs?""Beyond cross-selling, KBW expects Wells' net interest margins to be constrained, even after the bank grew loans considerably in quarters past.JPMorgan, another bank KBW said was dependent on loan growth after activity rose rapidly in recent quarters, is expected to report EPS down 17% to $1.39.The bank's equity markets could be a bright spot, KBW said. Revenue is expected to climb 2% to $23.988 billion.Citigroup's EPS, meanwhile, is expected to fall 15% to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344.Citigroup in June also acquired Costco's (COST) U.S. co-brand credit-card portfolio from American Express (AXP). Citi and Costco announced their co-branded credit-card deal last March.""(Q3) will be the first full quarter with Costco in the numbers and management has already indicated that the performance within the Costco portfolio is exceeding management's expectations,"" Kleinhanzl wrote. ""If Citi can show material growth in receivables from the Costco portfolio then we would expect shares of Citigroup to do well at earnings.""KBW also said Citigroup may have gotten more of a bump from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. But the bank has said that investment banking during the quarter was ""lighter than estimated.""JPMorgan dipped 0.3% in the stock market today, while Citigroup lost 0.6% and Wells Fargo eased 0.3%. Bank of America (BAC) fell 0.5%. Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 0.8%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) added 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis.

325,MS,"Bank stocks have rallied in recent weeks as the Fed has shown more openness to raising interest rates. Other factors could extend their gains, Morgan Stanley notes.That uptrend for the banks ""could continue if oil prices edge higher, inflation picks up, Yellen raises rates, corporates re-engage,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a research note. ""Risks include a divided government post-election, weak C&I growth, and political backlash.""Other risks for the banks include commercial lending, which KBW expects to weaken after the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union caused businesses to put plans on hold, which in turn meant less borrowing.Bank of America reports Monday, Goldman reports next Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley reports on Wednesday.IBD's money center banking industry group, where most of the major banks are, was ranked 131st out of 197 groups on Tuesday. It has been in the bottom half of the table for many months.RELATED:U.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain Embrace

326,MS,"Europe is the land of opportunity for American banks, and the latest dysfunction there could open up new possibilities.In Germany, Deutsche Bank's (DB) legal troubles are weighing on its financial health, and Commerzbank is cutting thousands of jobs. In the U.K., there's Brexit. In Italy, banks are inundated with bad loans and an upcoming constitutional reform vote is adding to uncertainty. In Spain, there's effectively no government. And today's negative interest rates risk becoming tomorrow's losses. And yet, amid all of Europe's turmoil and the potential impact on world markets, Bank of America (BAC) last month appeared to feel pretty good about its business globally. ""You might argue international markets, as we've seen, have had a rough ride, why invest now? Why do that now?"" Christian Meissner, Bank of America's head of global corporate and investment banking, said at a conference on Sept. 12. ""Our perspective is that, actually, the competitive opportunity for a firm like ours . . . has never been better."" He added: ""We've been able to gain share significantly.""As Deutsche Bank dragged markets lower this week and big investment banks on the Continent search for daylight following one financial emergency after another, a faster, steadier U.S. economic recovery has helped investment banks here widen their market-share lead over European counterparts on the world stage. But as Europe's economy wobbles, analysts also wonder how much further U.S. banks can go.From the beginning of this year to mid-September, U.S. banks had accounted for 55% of the world's investment-banking revenue, compared to 32% for their European counterparts, according to data from Dealogic. In 2006, U.S. banks took 49% and Europe 42%, the firm said. And the gap between those banks' share prices and profits has widened accordingly.For example, since the end of 2008, when the world was in the throes of the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) share price has more than doubled. Shares of Deutsche Bank, which crumbled in September after the Justice Department began settlement negotiations over a mortgage-securities case have plunged 70% since the end of 2008. (The stock jumped 14% Friday on reports the DOJ may settle for $5.4 billion instead of the $14 billion it initially sought.)""While we expect the US DOJ (residential mortgage-backed securities) case to be settled well below the ($14 billion) first claimed, the uncertainty is an overhang and in any case we think litigation will remain a strong drain on capital generation through 2017,"" Credit Suisse analysts said of Deutsche Bank in a recent research note.IBD'S TAKE: As Deutsche Bank crumbles, learn more about which bank stocks could be buying opportunities.Capital generation — particularly the kind required by U.S. post-crisis stress tests — has been among the main factors that have led U.S. investment banks' global gains, analysts say. The larger financial cushions have forced banks to rein in some lending activities at home, but also enable them to absorb risks from mergers and acquisitions, trading and other services provided by investment banks.""In a sense, the regulators have done them a bit of a favor in the U.S., although they probably don't view it that way,"" Guy Moszkowski, director of research at Autonomous Research, told IBD.Timing has also helped. The U.S. recession ended in 2009. After the mortgage bust, U.S. banks were able to recapitalize more quickly (again with help from the federal government), and regulators moved faster in developing new banking rules, thus giving banks added clarity. Amid a much choppier recovery in Europe, held back by the eurozone debt crisis, regulators there haven't forced the banks to hold onto as much capital — a situation that has become particularly pronounced with Deutsche Bank.""You look at what the U.S. government did, it was much more decisive in solving the problems,"" Morningstar analyst Michael Wong said. ""For however bureaucratic the U.S. is, it's still probably much easier to make a solution than to get a lot of different countries together to make a solution.""Taking care of ""problem assets"" is more arduous in Europe, said Fred Cannon, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. In Italy, for instance, resolving a bad loan has at times taken as long as eight years. And the European bank stress tests, he said, might suffer from a legitimacy problem.""For better or for worse, the U.S. stress tests are viewed as quite credible,"" Cannon said. ""And the European stress tests are not, in my view, viewed as very credible, and they keep changing and trying to get credibility.""Among other factors, the U.S. capital market is also just bigger and more homogenized. And banks like Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) continue to remain dedicated investment banks while European rivals pull back on investment banking or otherwise restructure.In capital markets, some of the pullback is due to regulatory and public pressure, Moszkowski said, pointing to countries like Switzerland where unease over the economy's dependence on giants like UBS (UBS) and Credit Suisse (CS) has worsened.The current market trends, however, have led to questions about where the plateau is for U.S. investment banks.""This is one of the longest-bull market economic expansions in history. Economic expansions don't just die because of old age, but it's definitely been a while,"" Wong said. He later added: ""It's hard to imagine what would lead to another jump.""Mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, happen when markets are good, and low interest rates may have pulled forward demand for services like debt refinancing, he said.But while U.S. lenders have benefited from their rivals' woes, what is plaguing Europe could eventually hurt American banks too.Europe's low or even negative interest rates have kept U.S. rates from rising, Cannon noted in a podcast. Those conditions, along with more regulations in Europe, could prolong economic malaise and keep the Fed from raising rates in the U.S., eroding returns on loans and hindering expansion.""There are limits to the growth,"" Moszkowski said. ""And at some point it becomes more important for the U.S. banks to actually see real growth in the markets themselves. In other words, what would be best for the big investment banks would be for some of the flagging Asian emerging markets and, of course, the flagging European markets very broadly, to just recover.""RELATED:Deutsche Bank Jumps On Report $5.4 Billion Settlement NearBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain EmbraceDeutsche Bank Is No Lehman, But Big U.S. Bank Stocks ReactDeutsche Bank, UBS, Others Follow JPMorgan, Citi In Digital CurrencyWhy Wall Street Banks Aren't Sweating New Liquidity RulesWells Fargo Stock Takes Hits, But Dividend, Earnings Still Intact

327,MS,"Shares of Deutsche Bank (DB) jumped after Agence-France Presse reported that the embattled German banking giant was close to settling a U.S. mortgage-securities case for $5.4 billion -- potentially far less than the $14 billion the Justice Department initially sought.The news came amid growing concerns about whether the bank would wind up crippled after the settlement as well as broader economic problems and political upheaval in Europe that have strained the region's banks.Bloomberg reported yesterday that a handful of hedge funds had cut their positions in the bank. While concerns have grown that Deutsche Bank's problems could ripple across the global financial system, analysts have cautioned against comparisons to a Lehman-Brothers-esque catastrophe.Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares jumped 14% to close at 13.09 in the stock market today, nearing their 50-day line. Shares have tumbled over the past year, and concerns about the bank have weighed on markets in recent days.U.S. banks followed. JPMorgan (JPM) rose 1.4%, while Bank of America (BAC) added 3.2% and Citigroup (C) gained 3.1%. All moved back above their 50-day lines, a key test of investor support.Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.5%, and Morgan Stanley (MS) climbed 3.3%. But Wells Fargo (WFC), whose CEO over the past two weeks has become a congressional punching bag over the bank's cross-selling scandal, dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: As Deutsche Bank rebounds, learn more about which bank stocks could be buying opportunities.Earlier in the day, Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan, in a letter to employees, touted the bank's fundamentals in an attempt to soothe anxieties about ""unjustified concerns"" regarding the bank.""It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business,"" he wrote. ""Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust.""Cryan added that the bank had more than 20 million clients and more than 215 billion euros (around $241 billion) in liquidity reserves, which an analyst said was among the bank's less-depressing characteristics.""Deutsche has many business-model issues but liquidity is not an issue,"" Guy Moszkowski, director of research at Autonomous Research, said over email.By comparison, Morgan Stanley, whose annual revenue was in the same range as Deutsche's, had a global liquidity reserve of $207 billion at the end of Q2. Morgan said that metric was composed of ""highly liquid and diversified cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered securities.""Cryan, in the letter, also said that the bank meets all capital requirements, and that its capital ratio would be further helped by the offloading of British insurer Abbey Life and the pending sale of its holdings in China's Hua Xia Bank.Some analysts had anticipated the settlement would be negotiated down from the $14 billion first proposed by the DOJ.""While we expect the US DOJ (residential mortgage-backed securities) case to be settled well below the ($14 billion) first claimed, the uncertainty is an overhang and in any case we think litigation will remain a strong drain on capital generation through 2017,"" Credit Suisse said in a recent research note.RELATED:Deutsche Bank Is No Lehman, But Big U.S. Bank Stocks Break Support

330,MS,"The independent directors of Wells Fargo (WFC) announced they have launched an independent probe into the banking giant's cross-selling scandal, with Chairman and CEO John Stumpf recusing himself from the inquiry.CEO Stumpf agreed to forfeit some $41 million worth of stock awards, and not receive any salary while the investigation is underway. He also will not get a 2016 bonus. Carrie Tolstedt, who had been retail banking chief during the abuses, has left Wells Fargo -- ahead of her planned year-end exit. She also will surrender $19 million in stock awards and will not get any severance or a 2016 bonus.""These initial actions will not preclude additional steps being taken with respect to Mr. Stumpf, Ms. Tolstedt or other executives as a consequence of the information developed in the investigation,"" Wells Fargo's independent directors said.Wells Fargo likely wanted to take some action before Stumpf returns to Capitol Hill Thursday for another grilling, this time by a House panel.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve this week said it wants Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and other top banks to hold more capital. That will boost financial stability but reduce bank profitability.Last week Senate lawmakers harshly criticized Stumpf and Wells Fargo for firing 5,300 employees for creating millions of unauthorized customer accounts over several years, but not holding any top executives accountable. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for Stumpf to resign.The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier Tuesday that Wells Fargo was mulling various clawback measures.Wells Fargo shares rose 0.5% to 45.09 on the stock market today.

331,MS,"Federal Reserve stress tests of the nation's eight largest banks just became a bigger impediment to issuing dividends and buying back shares, but the first exam under the new rules won't hit until 2018.In a Monday speech, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said that the eight U.S.-based banks important to the global financial system will face increased capital requirements under the new testing regime.Those eight banks are Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), State Street (STT) and Wells Fargo (WFC) (IBD).The biggest banks, with the highest capital requirements, will face the biggest impact from the change. Meanwhile, stress-testing and record-keeping will become somewhat less burdensome for banks with less than $250 billion in assets, Tarullo said.The changes to the stress-testing regime are consistent ""with the principle that financial regulation should be progressively more stringent for firms of greater importance, and thus potential risk, to the financial system,"" he said.Shares of Goldman Sachs sank 2.2% on the stock market today, piercing its 50-day moving average after back-to-back days of negative regulatory news. On Friday, the Fed released a proposed rule that would require Goldman, Morgan Stanley and other banks that take physical possession of commodities in metals and energy markets to hold more capital.Shares of JPMorgan fell 2.2%, closing pennies above their 50-day line after undercutting that support intraday. JPMorgan is still above a 65.08 buy point.Citigroup lost 2.7% and Bank of America 2.8%, both closing below their 50-day.Wells Fargo stock, which have been pummeled after disclosures it fraudulently opened millions of customer accounts, fell further on Monday, fell 1.9% to 44.88, its first close below 45 since February 2014.Morgan Stanley fell 2.8% and State Street 1.8%, but both remain above their 50-day averages.The Wells Fargo news increases the small but real political risk that Congress will seek to break up the big banks in 2017.""Large banks will lose additional political capital in the wake of the Wells Fargo headlines and will find it tougher to find allies in Congress to defend the banks,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' Washington analyst Brian Gardner.Another cloud for the banking sector comes from abroad, with Deutsche Bank (DB) shares sinking amid funding concerns as it girds for a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department, which is seeking a $14 billion fine in connection with the German bank's financial-crisis-era mortgage bond sales.U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank were down 7.1% to 11.85, hitting a record-low 11.23 intraday following reports that it sought help from Berlin in its Justice Department fight. The bank denied the reports and said it doesn't plan to increase its capital.IBD'S TAKE: Some bank stocks have traded more tightly as Wall Street speculates whether the Federal Reserve will decide to hike rates this year. See more details about which bank stocks might be in buy range. Under a 2015 rule, the biggest banks already face a requirement that they hold bigger capital buffers against losses. Now the Fed will incorporate those capital surcharges when it determines whether banks, in high-stress economic and financial conditions, would have sufficient capital to pay dividends and buy back shares.Some banks have worked to reduce their capital surcharge by decreasing deposits or derivatives holdings, and the stress-test change could lead to more of the same.Tarullo also said that stress tests have previously only looked at a bank's health based on its direct exposures to recessionary conditions, but would in the future factor in indirect effects from financial markets. One such indirect effect would come from ""the reduction in portfolio values for one bank by other banks selling certain types of assets in order to enhance their own solvency,"" Tarullo noted.Tarullo said that the stress tests won't be updated until 2018, except to grant some relief to non-systemically important banks.RELATED:JPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Waver As Rates To Stay Lower For Longer Wells Fargo Stock Takes Hits, But Dividend, Earnings Still Intact Citigroup, Like BofA, Sets Sights Abroad, But Q3 View Mixed

332,MS,"Deutsche Bank (DB) tumbled to a fresh all-time low as hedge funds that act as counterparties in derivatives trades stopped dealing with the beleaguered German financial giant. That rising mistrust raised concerns about the broader financial system, even as most financial experts insisted that this is not another ""Lehman"" moment, when the financial system froze up in the fall of 2008 after Lehman Bros.' collapse.Big bank stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) are falling, not plunging, but are undercutting their 50-day moving averages.Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares fell 6.7% to close at 11.48 on the stock market today, hitting even lower levels intraday. The SPDR Financial ETF (XLF) lost 1.4% to 19.04, finding resistance recently at the 50-day line.JPMorgan fell 1.6% to 65.65, threatening to close below its 50-day line for the first time since July 11. JPMorgan is still above a 65.08 buy point first cleared in early August, but undercutting key support lines is not encouraging.Bank of America dropped 1.4% to finish trading at 15.16 while Citigroup (C) lost 2.3% to 45.80. Both BofA and Citi finished below their 50-day moving average.Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 2.1% to close at 44.37, dropping below recent lows to hit its worst levels since February 2014.

333,MS,"A new Labor Department rule seeks to keep conflicts of interest out of the financial industry, but will it actually benefit you and other investors?The idea is to save each investor thousands of dollars -- perhaps every year -- by lowering fees, making investors' investment choices clearer, helping them avoid unnecessary costs by making their expenses clearer and by forcing brokers and financial advisors to guide them to potentially more productive investments even if they are less profitable for the broker or advisor.Brokers and financial advisors are scrambling to figure out what they must do to comply with the so-called fiduciary rule, which is due to take effect next April -- unless derailed by pending industry lawsuits. Firms are putting their own new rules in place for how to interact with clients -- what sorts of advice they'll be allowed to offer to investors like you, and what sorts they won't. They're updating software. And they're sorting out how to charge customers for service, with an earthquake tilt toward fees for service and fees on assets and away from commissions on transactions.The new rule will impact mainly brokers and financial advisors who help clients invest for retirement. About $1.9 trillion in investors' assets will be affected by 2020, according to a new study by global management consultant A.T. Kearney. It expects the asset shifts will involve about $23 billion in revenue, creating big winners and losers.Mutual fund complexes alone will see investors yank out $1 trillion in assets, Kearney says, costing them $14 billion in revenue. That tectonic shift is expected to result from investors fleeing fund fees that they perceive as too high or are steered into other investments by brokers and advisors, newly leery of violating the fiduciary rule.A swarm of pending lawsuits by players in the securities industry shows the industry's concern.Key plaintiffs include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Financial Services Institute, Financial Services Roundtable, Insured Retirement Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), National Association of Fixed Annuities, American Council of Life Insurers and National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.Individual investors should also be concerned. Sure, they should benefit from the new rule's prohibition against certain conflicts of interest.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering how to play the fiduciary rule fallout? See which publicly traded financial firms stand to benefit and which stand to lose in this IBD report.The rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit. Under the current standard, brokers and advisors can recommend investments so long as they are merely suitable for a client. That lets brokers and advisors recommend investments that are more profitable for them due to, say, commissions, even if other lower-cost investments would suit a client's need better.But the new rule will also have negative effects. ""Anything that has an impact of a reduction in personal touch, a potential increase in cost and/or a loss of continuity with professional advice could be characterized as negative,"" said Jason Grantz, managing sales director for the Eastern U.S. at Unified Trust Co. ""Several (effects) impact small accounts in particular."" The negatives include:To cope with changes your broker or advisor wants to implement, you might want to move assets to a firm that is prepared to deal with you in a manner more to your liking, Grantz says.On the other hand, individual investors may see benefits beyond just fewer conflicts of interest.You may see a decline in average expense ratios for funds offered to a firm's clients. That is the most frequently cited impact expected by asset managers polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for GMI.""Actively managed funds charge a premium for their efforts to outperform a benchmark, even though the majority of the survey respondents think that passive funds provide comparable returns to active investing,"" Rosenbluth writes in a new report.He added, ""Asset managers will need to be cognizant that advisors will be questioning whether their clients' best interest is being served by active funds that are more expensive than their peers.""Also, pricing transparency will increase, A.T. Kearney partner Uday Singh said.And simplified investment menus, the possible demise of high-fee funds with relatively poor track records and greater focus on low-cost passive funds will help investors meet their retirement savings goals, Rosenbluth says.As brokers and advisors seek to comply with the new rule, trillions in assets will shift among various types of financial firms between 2017 and 2020. Firms gaining assets will generally also gain revenue.Wirehouses -- big, full-service brokerages -- should see assets under management (AUM) decline by a net $300 billion, with a $4 billion decline in revenue, Kearney says. Their smaller competitors, known as independent broker-dealers in the industry, will likely be hurt by lower sales of high-commission products. They should lose $350 billion in AUM, causing a $3 billion loss in revenue.Also, costs of compliance will force smaller broker-dealers to consolidate.The ranks of winners should include registered investment advisors (RIAs), who already operate as fiduciaries, and robo-advisors. Relentless publicity about high fees and costs will prompt many self-directed individual investors to take their business away from brokers and advisors. Instead, Kearney forecasts, they will shift $150 billion in assets into funds they buy directly from mutual fund firms and into ETFs. Direct sellers of funds and ETFs stand to gain $1 billion in revenue, Kearney says.Wirehouses in the line of fire, Kearney says, include Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).Independent broker-dealers facing asset withdrawals include Raymond James (RJF) and Ameriprise (AMP).Vanguard, Betterment and Wealthfront offer robo-advisory services that stand to benefit from the shifts in assets. Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) are seen gaining inflow from self-directed investors.Retirement plan distributors like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price (TROW) could see a decline in revenue from 12b-1 fees -- annual marketing and distribution fees that are part of a fund's expense ratio. But they should benefit from assets staying inside 401(k) plans longer as fewer brokers and advisors urge workers and retirees to roll over money from company-sponsored retirement plans into IRAs, Kearney says.Fidelity is expanding its menu of ETFs and low-cost funds and its robo-advisory capacity. ""Fidelity is responding to what customers want with low-cost solutions and increasing its digital offerings,"" Singh said.""Digital offerings"" include not just robo-advisory services but also easier mobile and online service. ""That creates a frictionless user experience,"" Singh said. ""The question is, will Fidelity move far enough, quickly enough?""That same question applies to many financial firms in many categories, Singh adds.As for lawsuits by financial firms and organizations, which generally charge that the DOL overstepped its authority in creating the new rule, Chicago securities-fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann, who is not involved in any of the cases, predicts that none will derail the new rule.""Because the DOL capitulated on so many issues that were so important to the securities industry in the final draft of the rule, I think that has made the rule relatively bulletproof in terms of judicial review,"" he said.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsTips For Advisors Who Are Considering Partnering With A Broker-DealerThese Investors Will Soon Get More Robo-Advisors

The estimate for the federal funds rate in 2017 has slipped to 1.1% in 2017 from a 1.6% view in June, 2018's views dropped to 1.9% from 2.4%, and the longer-run forecast is now 2.9% vs. 3%.""The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives,"" the central bank said in a statement after its two-day September meeting this week.Shares of JPMorgan finished 0.6% higher on the stock market today, while Bank of American and Goldman Sachs rose 0.3%.

Investment banking revenue for the quarter was weaker than expected.In slides accompanying the presentation, Citigroup said it was focused on three areas, North America, Mexico and Asia. In particular, Gerspach sees ""tremendous untapped potential"" in Mexico, touting improvements in Citigroup's card business there saying at the conference that the nation was ""a country that is still on the come,"" according to Reuters.Citigroup said revenue trends were improving in Asia and Latin America, with card revenue and retail banking helping the consumer banking market in Mexico pick up steam.Citigroup shares fell 0.4% to 46.75 in the stock market today, though it's still near the top of a recent consolidation JPMorgan (JPM) sank 0.2% while Goldman Sachs (GS) lost 0.5%.  Morgan Stanley (MS) closed 0.3% higher.JPMorgan, at the same conference earlier this week, said more millennials preferred it as their primary financial institution for checking, savings and credit-card accounts.The conference comes as U.S. banks outshine and take market share from their European rivals in investment banking. While some international markets have struggled, a Bank of America official at the Barclays conference this week said the opportunity for global expansion ""has never been better.""IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have rallied on more bullish remarks from Fed officials.

337,MS,"Even as Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO John Stumpf faced a grilling from the Senate on Tuesday about employees' alleged sales misconduct -- along with questions on Twitter (TWTR) about his bandaged right hand -- analysts appeared to remain bullish on the bank in the longer term, even if profits suffer through next year and regulations tighten.""Yes, we could see more volatility ahead as headline risk persists, but Wells is rarely this inexpensive,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said of Wells Fargo's shares in a note on Tuesday upgrading the stock.Morgan Stanley upgraded Wells Fargo stock to overweight from equal-weight but cut its price target to 53 from 56.That stock, which finished up 1.2% in the stock market today, has tumbled this month after Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $185 million fine to regulators following accusations that its employees created up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to jolt sales figures and hit sales targets.Wells fired 5,300 workers in connection with the matter, and the bank reportedly faces a Justice Department investigation.Still, the scrutiny of the bank's sales practices was unlikely to threaten Wells' dividend, Graseck wrote.""WFC has received no objection from the Fed on its 2016 (capital plan), and the recent $185M fine had no material impact on EPS (<1%),"" she said.Morgan Stanley said the fallout should cost Wells Fargo 4 cents, or 1%, worth of full-year estimated earnings per share in 2016. Morgan Stanley also cut its 2017 EPS target by 3% to $4.10 because of the situation.""Additional fines are likely to be limited as Wells booked very little revenue from the opening of unauthorized accounts ($2.5-5.0M in total), hired a 3rd party to review its entire system, paid a fine that was more than 30x the revenues generated, and is changing its compensation system for its consumer bankers.""But growth in credit-card fees and deposit service charges was likely to slow as the company does away with sales goals and adjusts incentives, she said.Stumpf on Tuesday told the Senate Banking Committee that he was ""deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill on our responsibility to our customers, to our team members, and to the American public.""""Wrongful sales practice behavior in our retail banking business goes against everything regarding our core principals, our ethics and our culture,"" he said.He said the bank ""never directed, nor wanted our team members to provide products and services to customers that they did not want."" Stumpf said management first learned of the fake accounts in 2013, and said they should have taken care of the matter earlier.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was not impressed.""You should resign, you should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"" she said.Earlier, Warren questioned Stumpf about the company's cross-selling practices -- or getting customers to use more of the bank's products. Stumpf, before Warren cut him off, said that cross-selling was ""shorthand for deepening relationships.""Holding up a thick stack of papers, Warren then offered select quotes from what she said were transcripts of 12 quarterly earnings calls from 2012 to 2014 in which management touted record cross-selling in Wells' retail banking segment. The sales tactics in question allegedly date back to 2011.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a research note last week said they believe Wells Fargo shares were ""nearing a bottom of the relative underperformance"" and that they were trading at a discount.""Based on past incidences at high-quality banks, the overhang on valuation from scandals can last 3 to 10 months based on the severity of the negative actions,"" analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a research note dated Sept. 15.""We would characterize Wells Fargo as being on the low-end of the severity in terms of potential losses,"" he continued, ""but the company would be near the high end for reputational damage given management's position that they are not a Wall Street bank so improper activity is less expected.""KBW also noted that Wells' cross-selling scandal, for now, had cost the bank some 0.07% of its overall market-cap value. That was far less than JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) ""London Whale"" derivative debacle, the losses UBS (UBS) suffered after its ""rogue trader"" scandal, Barclays' (BCS) LIBOR-rigging scandal or Volkswagen's (VLKAY) emissions-cheating, the firm said.IBD's TAKE: As Wells Fargo becomes the latest bank in recent years to face a financial scandal, other bank stocks have traded more tightly as Wall Street speculates whether the Federal Reserve will decide to hike rates this year. See more detail about which bank stocks might be in buy range. KBW analyst Brian Gardner, in a separate note, said the cross-selling scandal would affect the banking industry into next year. He added that the incident could kill congressional efforts to modify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's powers, raise the probability that lawmakers will try to break up the biggest banks, and affect executive compensation.""At some point we would expect Wells' CEO to fall on the sword by forgoing compensation and trying to clawback compensation where possible,"" Kleinhanzl wrote in his note last week. ""To us, that seems a path that is most palatable to investors.""Shares of JPMorgan edged up 0.4%, while UBS dipped 0.9%. Bank of America (BAC) added less than 0.1%, and Citigroup (C) eased 0.1%.

338,MS,"Wells Fargo's (WFC) John Stumpf should resign, give back his compensation and face criminal prosecution for a scandal in which the bank opened unauthorized accounts for thousands of customers, Senator Elizabeth Warren said.""So you haven't resigned, you haven't returned a single nickel of your personal earnings, you haven't fired a single senior executive,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said Tuesday as the bank's chief executive officer testified before the Senate Banking Committee.""Instead, evidently your definition of accountable is to push the blame to your low-level employees who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves,"" Warren said. ""It's gutless leadership.""Wells Fargo agreed to pay a record $185 million to authorities including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after a review found employees may have opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without consumers' permission. Stumpf, 63, told lawmakers he was ""deeply sorry"" and detailed a five-year timeline of attempts the bank made to deter misconduct.Warren told Stumpf he should ""give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.""The lender is also contacting all of its customers nationwide to ensure their accounts and credit cards are products they need and want, said Stumpf, who is also the bank's chairman.""The Wells Fargo board is actively engaged in this issue,"" Stumpf said. ""The board has the tools to hold senior management accountable, including me and Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of our retail banking business. Any board actions taken with our named executive officers will be appropriately disclosed, and I want to be clear on this, I will respect and accept the decision of the board.""Stumpf is under political pressure to punish senior managers, such as calls by Warren to claw back millions of dollars in pay from Tolstedt.The bank had announced in July that Tolstedt was retiring. On Monday, it said Claudia Russ Anderson, who had overseen risk in the retail banking unit, is taking a six-month unpaid leave for personal reasons.""Carrie chose to retire,"" Stumpf said, adding that he and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan told her the bank wanted ""to go in a different direction."" She was eligible for retirement ""and she decided to retire"" after that conversation, Stumpf said.Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, told the CEO that the bank's response has been inadequate, and said, for example, that Wells Fargo hasn't yet calculated what effect lower credit scores resulting from the fake accounts might have had on customers' finances. Senior management downplayed the importance of the problem and continued to award performance bonuses to those involved as recently as two months ago, Brown said.""You would think the lessons of the financial crisis, which came at such a high cost to our country, would change the way banks do business,"" Brown said.Other witnesses Tuesday include U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Tom Curry, who said in prepared remarks that he's directing bank examiners to review sales practices at all ""large and midsize banks,"" and that the agency could pursue its own enforcement action against people at Wells Fargo. CFPB Director Richard Cordray also was scheduled to speak.Stumpf, who testified with a bandaged right hand the firm said he injured while playing with his grandchildren, provided a timeline of the bank's own investigation into the matter. In 2011, a dedicated team began to monitor and root out improper sales. The firm started terminating roughly 1,000 of its 100,000 retail banking employees annually for violations. By 2012, the lender began lowering some sales goals for compensation.In 2015, an OCC review of Wells Fargo's sales practices revealed shortcomings that prompted the agency to demand changes -- including telling the bank to compensate customers for any harm suffered. The company had to bring in an outside consultant, Curry said. Wells Fargo hired PricewaterhouseCoopers in August 2015 to help determine whether customers were hurt, according to Stumpf.The CEO outlined other ways Wells Fargo has tried to prevent unauthorized accounts from being created, including working with regulators and creating a new branch compliance program.A group of Democratic Senators, led by Warren, last week wrote a letter pressing Stumpf with questions on pay. The lawmakers singled out Tolstedt, writing that there appears ""to be multiple grounds on which to trigger the clawback provisions to recoup some or all of Ms. Tolstedt's incentive rewards.""The House Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Jeb Hensarling, said last week it also plans to conduct its own investigation and will hold a separate hearing later this month. Hensarling, a Texas Republican, said he plans to request that Stumpf appear for that hearing, too. Tolstedt as well as other corporate officers will be called for transcribed interviews, the lawmaker said.

339,MS,"John Stumpf, responding to allegations that Wells Fargo (WFC) opened millions of unauthorized accounts, said his bank failed its customers and the American public.In remarks prepared for the Senate Banking Committee, Stumpf said the scandal was not an ""orchestrated effort"" and that the company never wanted employees to open accounts that they didn't need or want.""I am deeply sorry,"" Stumpf said in a copy of his testimony that was obtained by Bloomberg. Stumpf, chairman and chief executive officer, is scheduled to appear before the panel Tuesday in Washington.""I am going to explain this morning what happened and what we have done about it,"" Stumpf said in the prepared remarks. ""Wrongful sales practice behavior goes entirely against our values, ethics and culture.""The San Francisco-based bank agreed earlier this month to pay $185 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators to resolve claims that employees opened more than 2 million accounts that consumers may not have known about. Stumpf is testifying Tuesday before the committee, chaired by Republican Richard Shelby.IBD'S TAKE: Wells Fargo shares rose Monday, but have fallen sharply since the cross-selling revelations. Meanwhile, two bank IPOs had a successful debut on Friday.Other witnesses include U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Tom Curry, who said he's directing bank examiners to review sales practices at all ""large and midsize banks,"" and could pursue its own enforcement action against individuals at Wells Fargo, according to prepared remarks. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray is also scheduled to testify.Stumpf's testimony walks through a timeline of the bank's own investigation into the matter and firing of employees. Efforts to detect and deter unethical conduct were put in place ""out of concerns that some employees were not doing what was right,"" according to Stumpf. Starting in 2011, the bank assigned a dedicated team to monitor and root out sales practice violations. Sales employees began being terminated for misconduct as a result of the investigation. Starting in 2012, the lender began to reduce certain sales goals for compensation.In 2015, an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency review of Wells Fargo's sales practices revealed shortcomings that prompted the agency to demand changes -- including telling the bank to compensate customers for any harm they suffered from bad sales practices, and that the company had to bring in an outside consultant to review what was going on, Curry said. Wells Fargo hired PricewaterhouseCoopers in August 2015 to help determine whether customers incurred financial harm, according to Stumpf.""Despite all those efforts, we did not get it right,"" Stumpf said. ""We should have done more sooner to eliminate unethical conduct and unintended incentives for that conduct to occur. Even one unauthorized account is one too many.""Stumpf also outlined other ways Wells Fargo has tried to prevent unauthorized accounts from being created, including working with regulators and creating a new branch compliance program.Stumpf's testimony isn't likely to quell concerns lawmakers have about what the bank is doing to hold some of its top executives accountable. The remarks don't discuss executive compensation or give any information about whether the board plans to consider clawing back pay for some top managers, including Carrie Tolstedt, the retired executive who led the unit where the alleged misconduct occurred.A group of Democratic Senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, last week wrote a letter to Stumpf asking questions about pay. The lawmakers singled out Tolstedt, writing that there appears ""to be multiple grounds on which to trigger the clawback provisions to recoup some or all of Ms. Tolstedt's incentive rewards.""The OCC, which regulates Wells Fargo, began receiving complaints in 2012 from consumers and employees about ""improper sales practices,"" Curry said. In his remarks, Curry said the agency has started ""a review of individual misconduct and culpability.""The House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Jeb Hensarling, said last week it plans to conduct its own investigation and will hold a separate hearing later this month. Hensarling says he plans to request that Stumpf appear for that hearing too. Tolstedt as well as other corporate officers will be called for transcribed interviews, Hensarling said.

340,MS,"Two heads can be better than one. Or, if not better, at least less volatile. For proof, look no further than $25.6 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).The $25.6 billion portfolio, which is sold through financial advisors, is up 4.75% this year going into Monday. Its stablemate is $108.5 billion Contrafund (FCNTX). Both funds have marquee manager Will Danoff at the helm. New Insights — once a clone of Contrafund — has behaved differently since John Roth became co-manager three years ago.Contrafund's 9.27% average annual gain ranks in the top 1% of large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 15 years. New Insight's 7.95% ranks in the top 38% over the past 10 years. But so far this year New Insights 4.75% gain is in the top 14% of the same peer group vs. top 38% for Contrafund's 2.62% gain.Roth's portfolio picks go a long way to explaining why two top-notch funds, sharing a lead manager, have performed differently in the short term. Roth and Danoff talk together a lot and powwow formally once a week. But they run separate sleeves of Insights' securities.Differences in their picks add diversification. ""That gives us more ability to weather volatility,"" Roth said.On Friday, New Insights had a trio of 2%-plus gainers, as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) each tacked on more than two percentage points.Netflix announced a deal last week with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to expand its global footprint. That's a key goal as the company nears saturation in the U.S. Customers of the jumbo global cable operator will be able to access Netflix content via Liberty set top boxes, but Netflix will retain a billing relationship with viewers. Netflix has recently announced other deals with other cable operators, including Comcast (CMCSA). And this month it is slated to become the exclusive viewing platform for certain films made by Walt Disney (DIS).Tesla rose amid an intensifying friction with former BFF (best friends forever, as the kids say) Mobileye (MBLY). Tesla accused Mobileye of trying to throw a monkey wrench into its efforts to develop vision chips on its own. Mobileye said it ended its relationship with Tesla in July because the electric car maker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""Tesla said Mobileye bailed because Tesla was planning to rely more on radar systems and less on camera-based driver-assistance systems such as those developed by Mobileye.IBD'S TAKE: Our Ed Carson digs into details of the spiraling cat fight between Tesla and Mobileye in this report.Tesla's 6% share price surge Friday -- lifting it 6% for the entire week -- and Mobileye's pullback show which side investors favor in this feud.New Insights owns both stocks.As for UnitedHealth, its Friday rise was on good volume. The stock is shaping a flat base with a 144.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about UnitedHealth's prognosis, see how it stacks up against other stocks in its industry at IBD's Stock Checkup.Roth says some stocks he likes today reflect his past experiences at the helms of Fidelity's sector funds focused on multimedia, chemicals and utilities. ""I'm opportunistic, with a growth bias and a valuation sensibility,"" he said.Roth, who also runs $3 billion New Millennium (FMILX), says he prefers fewer stocks in his sleeve of New Insights than Danoff. He also tilts more to midcaps. His eye on valuation recently has led Roth to beaten-down names in energy and financials.Among the names in New Insights that are not in Contrafund, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence: American International Group (AIG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Antero Resources (AR), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chevron (CVX), Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), Exelon (EXC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).""I'm more of the energy guy,"" Roth said. ""I do think there are points in time when you want different cyclical groups.""Share prices of most of the energy names, for example, have yet to perk up a lot. But Roth says the conditions for a rebound are falling into place. U.S. production is sliding, he says, adding, ""Share prices are down, demand (for energy) is relatively good and we've seen a massive amount of capital come out of the space over the past 12 to 18 months. Rig count is down 40% to 60%. Hundreds of billions of dollars in exploration-and-production cap ex has come out.""Roth describes his thesis as of his latest disclosure for Diamondback Energy (FANG): ""We have bigger diversified companies, some service companies and smaller U.S.-focused E&Ps,"" he said. ""Diamondback is a classic one of those. It is an independent E&P with a good spot in the Permian Basin. It has great acreage that it will exploit at attractive costs.""Energy accounted for about 8% of New Insights' assets, its fifth-largest sector by weight, as of July 31. Contra has about 2% in the sector and New Millennium 16%.Technology, with a 26% weighting, is tops. The fund's top-three holdings are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The fund has been trimming Facebook, but only to take profits and prevent the stake from getting too big. It was about 5% as of July 31. ""It's still our largest relative bet. It is our most important stock,"" said Roth.One leg of Facebook's appeal has been its success in shifting from a web focus to a mobile one. Another has been its success at remaining relevant to users through platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. A third has been its ability to show advertisers the link between an ad and a sale. ""That's the ability to optimize ad campaigns and (let advertisers) see the return on investment,"" he said.Google is a similar story, Roth adds.Amazon's retail and music businesses do well, Roth says. But Amazon's key improvement is its AWS web services business. It wasn't until mid-2015 that Amazon broke out AWS' financial results.

341,MS,"Deutsche Bank (DB) confirmed late Thursday that the Justice Department has proposed that the German banking giant pay a $14 billion fine related to its underwriting of residential mortgage securities from 2005-2007.Deutsche Bank said it ""has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near"" the $14 billion figure, which is much higher than most analysts have expected. It stressed that the DOJ was only making an opening proposal. Deutsche Bank will make its own counteroffer, predicting the final settlement will be far less.Still, Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares tumbled more than 9% to 13.41 in premarket trading on the stock market today, not far from the record low of 12.48 set in early August. U.S. shares rose 1.65% to 14.76 on Thursday. The stock has been in a long, multiyear downturn as it struggles for growth.The Justice Department has collected some $45 billion in fines related to mortgage-backed securities from five banks: Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide during the financial crisis, paid the most with a $16.65 billion settlement in 2014.RELATED:Wells Fargo Reportedly Faces Federal Probe Over Sales TacticsBank Stocks Hold Ground As Fed Buzz Builds: Which One Is A Buy Now?Where Do Millennials Bank?

342,MS,"The wealth manager to Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg and other technology entrepreneurs is starting a unit to invest in data centers to profit from growing demand for cloud-based services.Iconiq Capital, the San Francisco-based investment advisor run by Divesh Makan, registered a new subsidiary with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month that will put client funds into technology-related real estate, according to documents filed with the agency. Its holdings will range from direct investments in data centers to securities issued by real estate investment trusts specializing in the sector.Facebook, the world's largest social-media company, and other technology giants have already spent billions of dollars building data centers to provide cloud-based computer services to individual customers, according to Anand Srinivasan, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. That spending pales in comparison to the amount of funding that will be required as global corporations turn to the cloud to meet their computing needs.""We are just scratching the surface on the large data center expansion trend,"" Srinivasan said. Iconiq, in starting a fund to invest in data centers, ""has definitely picked up on a trend.""The demand for additional capacity has already fueled a surge in the market value of publicly traded tech companies and REITs that own and operate data centers. A basket of seven data-center stocks, including Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX), has jumped about 30% this year, according to recent data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a gain of around 7% by the S&P 500 Index.""The public REITs in the data-center space have been the best-performing sector of stocks in the past eight months,"" Jerald Kent, chairman of TierPoint, a closely held provider of cloud-computing services, said in a telephone interview. ""Historically, they are trading at very robust multiples,"" said Kent, whose St. Louis-based company owns 39 data centers.Iconiq referred calls to an outside spokeswoman, who declined to comment. The firm is owned by Makan along with partners Chad Boeding, Michael Anders and William Griffith.Iconiq opened in 2011, the year before Facebook held its $16 billion initial public offering, the biggest ever by a U.S. technology company. Before starting the firm, Makan, Boeding and Anders all worked at Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), two of the main underwriters for the Facebook IPO.As a multifamily office, Iconiq focuses on providing wealth-management services to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. It had about $16.7 billion of assets under management at the end of last year, including $4.8 billion in discretionary accounts. According to regulatory filings, clients include Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster; Reid Hoffman, the chairman of LinkedIn (LNKD); and Zuckerberg, who at age 32 ranks as the world's fifth-richest person with an estimated net worth of more than $57 billion, mostly in Facebook stock.While Iconiq primarily helps clients allocate their money to outside hedge and private equity funds, the firm also runs its own proprietary investment vehicles. On Aug. 8, it completed the registration process for Iconiq DC Management, the subsidiary setting up private funds to make real estate investments in data centers or ""technology connectivity-related assets,"" according to the SEC filing.The new money manager is organizing its first fund, the filing shows. Once it has raised capital, the funds will make direct investments in property, sponsor or invest in REITs, provide mortgage financing and form joint ventures with other investors.""Given Iconiq Capital's broad relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies and innovators,"" the unit is ""able to access proprietary market insights unavailable to most sponsors"" of investment funds, Makan's firm said in the filing.RELATED:In Hot REIT Space, Data Centers Seen Having An AdvantageFacebook, Microsoft Capital Spending Good For Data Center REITsData Center REITs Hit New Highs As Cloud Expands

343,MS,"Bank stocks are holding up relatively well amid a sharp market sell-off Friday as more Federal Reserve officials prime the U.S. for a potential interest-rate hike. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) remained the only big-bank stock within buy range as of Friday afternoon.JPMorgan Chase fell 0.9% to close at 66.65 in the stock market today, as it was downgraded on Friday by Macquarie Research. But it's still above a 65.08 buy point cleared in early August from a handle in a consolidation.Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Friday that waiting too long to raise rates could damage the economy.""My personal view, based on economic data that we have received to date, is that a reasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual normalization of monetary policy,"" Rosengren said to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, Quincy, Mass.Several other policymakers have made similar comments. But Rosengren had long been considered a policy dove. His comments raised the odds of a September-meeting rate hike, but most investors see the next move in December.The Fed rate-hike buzz is a headwind and a tailwind for bank stocks. Rate hikes would probably help banks boost net interest margins. But with the general market selling off, it's hard for financials to advance.IBD'S TAKE: Bank earnings are long gone, but Fed news -- and key economic data that shift rate-hike expectations -- can give bank stocks a quick boost or cut them off. If you're holding financial stocks or ETFs heading into the Fed policy meeting on Sept. 20-21, consider this risk-limiting earnings options strategy.Superregional bank SunTrust Banks (STI), meanwhile, has flirted with a 44.29 buy point over the past week or so, and ended Friday trades down 1.1% to 43.39. Great Western Bancorp (GWB), meanwhile, faded from a 35.01 entry by dropping 0.7% to 32.03, but was still trading within a flat base pattern.Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were not within buy range. Citigroup is facing resistance at the 48 price range.Bank of America fell fractionally to end the day at 15.74. Citigroup dropped 1.3% to 47.17 while Morgan Stanley lost 1.4% to 31.59, while Goldman Sachs lost 1.8% to 168.57. Wells Fargo (WFC) slid by 2.4% to 48.72, dropping below its 200-day line.Wells Fargo on Thursday agreed to pay a $185 million fine after authorities said 5,300 workers surreptitiously opened credit-card and deposit accounts in customers' names in a scheme to juice sales numbers.

344,MS,"Small British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) soared in the last hour of trading Wednesday on a report that it had hired a banker to field buyout offers.Reuters reported that GW hired Morgan Stanley (MS) after it received unsolicited interest from other drugmakers, citing anonymous sources. GW Pharma stock jumped nearly 20% after Reuters tweeted the news in midafternoon, to close at 104.03, a nearly one-year high.GW's main asset is Epidiolex, a cannabis-derived drug it's testing in rare forms of severe epilepsy. GW is in a race against Insys Therapeutics (INSY), which is also seeking the coveted seven-year exclusivity granted to orphan drugs with a very similar product. Insys' stock rose 5.2% late in the day to close at 15.71.One of Reuters' sources said that logical buyers could be Novartis (NVS), Bayer (BAYRY) or Spain's Almirall, since they partner with GW to market its other cannabis-based medicine, Sativex. It's unknown, though, just which drugmakers have approached GW.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks make unpredictable moves based on buyout rumors, but releases of clinical-trial data are often equally important and can be seen ahead of time.

"
347,MS,"Stocks traded nominally lower by early afternoon Wednesday, but some tech stocks and a young, fast-growing homebuilder affirmed that growth investors have opportunities to capitalize.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which seems to have escaped a number of egg-in-the-face headlines in recent years including big fines by the government and a huge trading loss courtesy of the ""London Whale,"" is holding firm amid more hints among Federal Reserve leaders that a rate hike is still in the cards later this year. In fact, it's legitimate to say that JPMorgan shares have broken out of a nine-week cup with handle with a 65.08 buy point in solid volume on Aug. 5.Volume that week jumped sharply vs. the prior week, a good sign for breakouts. The stock, however, is still within a much longer consolidation that stretches back to an all-time peak of 70.61 in July 2015. The stock edged 0.5% lower to 67.11, still in buy range from the recent 65.08 pivot point. The 5% chase zone extends up to 68.33.San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank chief John Williams reportedly said that another a rise in short-term interest rates ""is on the table"" when the U.S. central bank meets on interest rate policy on Sept. 20-21. Williams told reporters in Reno, Nev., that the U.S. economy is at full employment and ""within sight"" of the 2% inflation target, Reuters said. However, Williams also cautioned against rapid rate increases in the future due to low productivity growth and an aging population that buffers the potential growth rate of the future economy.The Nasdaq composite rallied to a new all-time high of 5287 before receding to drop 0.15%. On Tuesday, IBD's current outlook for the market switched from ""Uptrend under pressure"" to ""Uptrend resumes."" The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials lost about 0.25%.Despite the piecemeal moves, stocks in the IBD 50 showed fortitude, indicating continued optimism among fund managers about both the economy and earnings in the second half of the year. LGI Homes (LGIH), No. 2 within the IBD 50, jumped more than 2% to 39.64. Volume was running more than 90% higher than its usual pace. Its 50-day average volume is 528,000 shares. The homebuilder is on a mission to expand its starter home strategy across the country and is making progress in the Pacific Northwest. LGI Homes reported strong home closings for August late Tuesday.The stock showed a bullish bounce off its 50-day moving average near 31 on Aug. 4. A few days later, the small cap shot back above a 34.60 alternate buy point within a long and deep cup base. LGI, based in Woodlands, Texas, sports a top-notch 99 EPS Rating as earnings per share have grown on average a blistering 79% vs. year-ago levels over the past three quarters.Also in the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC), Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) and food reservation and ordering service GrubHub (GRUB) continue to act well and remain in solid uptrends. Paycom has risen more than 20% past a 42.70 handle buy point, justifying a move to sell at least some shares and capture profits. Ubiquiti has also achieved a 20%-25% profit from a proper breakout at 41.31. Yet those with strong conviction and a big profit cushion have the option to be patient and hold through the next normal correction.JPMorgan's Banks-Money Center industry group is still lagging the S&P 500, up less than 4% year-to-date. However, more interest rates would likely give some sort of boost to many lenders, who have seen their profit margins on conventional loans get pinched due to near-zero rates. In the same group, Bank of Montreal (BMO) pulled back 0.9% to 66.84, still above a recent flat-base breakout at 66.39.The large-cap Canadian bank is a leader with a 77 Composite Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, a 66 EPS Rating, 74 RS and a 1.2 up/down volume ratio, which indicates that volume on up days in price has exceeded downside volume over the past 50 sessions.Morgan Stanley (MS), also in the same group, has rallied nicely since retaking its 50-day line in early June and is now basing. Watch for a potential buy point to develop near 35. Bank of America (BAC) has formed a somewhat wide-and-loose long cup with handle with a 16.34 buy point. The base passes the midpoint test (midpoint of the handle at 15.95, midpoint of the base at 14.54).Ferrari (RACE) is not in the IBD 50, yet its breakout also deserves notice. The Italian sports car maker, featured in the IBD Stock Market Today column on Aug. 2, rose more than 2% in fast trading, revving past a 49.21 handle buy point within a long first-stage cup pattern. The stock went public on Oct. 21 last year and had a sterling debut, rising to as high as 60.97 before fading fast. In early December, Ferrari encountered upside resistance near 50.IBD'S TAKE: The cup with handle base is one of more than seven bullish patterns that savvy growth investors must know in order to capture big gains in the biggest stock market winners.

348,MS,"Deutsche Bank (DB), UBS (UBS), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Banco Santander (SAN) are jointly developing a blockchain-based currency to clear securities trades more quickly, following efforts by JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to develop their own digital methods to settle such transactions.Blockchain, the technology initially used to move Bitcoin transactions, allows stock and bond trades and other such exchanges to take place through a shared ledger database system, cutting down on the middlemen often needed to allow those transactions to take place. Banks have become increasingly interested in the technology, and the ""fintech"" startups that use it, as a way to modernize their own infrastructure and potentially save billions in transaction-settlement costs for trades.Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of New York Mellon, Banco Santander and ICAP, an electronic broker, will try to sell the plan to develop what they call the Utility Settlement Coin to central banks, the Financial Times reported.The Utility Settlement Coin, which would be convertible into a variety of currencies at central banks, was first introduced last year by UBS and tech firm Clearmatics, another participant in the joint effort. The firms hope to launch the digital coin on a small scale by 2018.Development efforts will focus on the ""financial structuring"" of the digital currency, building the platform out through several phases intended to draw more users, Deutsche Bank said in a statement Wednesday. The firms plan to test the digital currency in a real-market environment.Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares closed up 1.4% in the stock market today, while UBS rose 1.8%, and Bank of New York Mellon edged up 0.1%. Santander added 1.4%. JPMorgan ticked 0.3% higher, Goldman lost 0.5%, and Citigroup added 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: The financial technology, or ""fintech,"" industry has the potential to upend the landscape of traditional banking. But regulators have become increasingly concerned about mismanagement and insufficient oversight. Find out more about the broader fintech industry.The fintech industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with an array of startups trying to take the hassle out of sending and receiving money by moving much of the process to your phone, computer or other mobile device. But as those companies speed up the process of payments and loans, calls have grown for tighter regulation of the industry.""Active dialogue with central banks and regulators will continue to ensure a regulation-compliant, robust and efficient structure within which the USC can be deployed,"" Deutsche Bank said in the statement about the Utility Settlement Coin project.RELATED:

352,MS,"Iron ore, dubbed by Citigroup (C) as one of the hot commodities of 2016, looks set to cool off. Prices may soon sag as supply rises and steel demand fades, the bank said, adding to a chorus of forecasters who are calling time on an unexpected rally.The raw material will average $51 a metric ton in the final quarter and $45 in 2017 under the base-case scenario, analysts led by Ed Morse said in a report received Tuesday. That compares with Metal Bulletin Ltd.'s 62% content price of $61.75 a dry ton on Tuesday, and a year-to-date average of $53.64.""Believe it or not iron ore, coal are the hot commodities of 2016,"" the bank said in the note, advising that investors ""fade them as commodities stumble to rebalance."" It added: ""Don't expect the strength to last. Structurally the world remains oversupplied with relatively low-cost material.""While iron ore has soared more than 40% in 2016 after three annual losses, banks are now queuing up to forecast the likelihood of further weakness ahead, with Morgan Stanley (MS) and UBS Group (UBS) also flagging prospects for declines as 2016 unfolds. Citigroup said that although iron ore's strength may persist into October, a weakening of demand, coupled with rising mine supply, would probably hurt prices thereafter.Iron ore ""may face strong headwinds towards the end of 2016 and most of 2017,"" the analysts wrote, calling it a ""darling"" of commodities so far this year. ""Supply-and-demand balances in 2017 point to lower prices, with Chinese demand deteriorating and new projects by Vale and Roy Hill....""Prospects for increased supply include output from Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill project in the Pilbara, as well as expansions by top shipper Vale (VALE) in Brazil, which is set to start up its S11D project by the end of 2016. Production from low-cost miners remains strong and there are signs of inventories building across ports in China, according to Citigroup.Morgan Stanley has forecast that prices may tumble back to $40 a ton this half as the approach of winter in China blunts steel demand and output, according to a report earlier this month. In July, UBS said iron ore's revival in 2016 has prompted mine restarts, adding to global supplies and potentially causing prices to ease into next year.Not everyone is bearish. Iron ore will probably extend this year's rally as China takes further steps to stoke growth and the dollar weakens, according to Prestige Economics' Jason Schenker, who made a rare bullish call in the final quarter of last year even as the commodity posted a double-digit loss.Miners' views are mixed. Last week, BHP Billiton's (BHP) Andrew Mackenzie said there's more risk for prices to the downside as the ramp-up by low-cost producers continues. Fortescue Metals Group, Australia's third-biggest miner, said on Monday that steel demand and iron ore prices may be supported as increased infrastructure spending in China is likely to continue.Steel rebar futures in China have soared 46% this year, recovering after five annual declines, as stimulus from the government and a property rebound lifted demand at a time of low inventories. While Citigroup noted that China's steel production had surged earlier this year, conditions were seen as weakening.""Our bearish call on iron ore stems primarily from a bearish steel call,"" Citigroup said. ""Economic indicators suggested sluggish growth momentum for the rest of the year, which may put more pressure on steel demand.""
"
353,MS,"Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) led a rally in bank stocks Friday, as the strong July jobs report raised the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, potentially boosting lenders' net interest margins.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, far above expectations for 185,000, and hiring gains for the prior two months were revised up. The unemployment rate for July remained at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate crept up 0.1 point. The July figures follow strong results in June, after May's data disappointed.Fed funds futures prices indicate the chances of a rate hike at the central bank's September meeting have doubled to 18%.Shares of Bank of America closed up nearly 4% to 15.05 on the stock market today, gapping above their 200-day average for the first time since late December. Citigroup jumped 4.3% to 45.72, touching its 200-day line. JPMorgan rose 2.7% to 66.30. Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.8% to 48.68, retaking its 50-day line. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 2.6% to 162.09 while rival Morgan Stanley (MS) also rose 2.6%, to end the week at 29.01.IBD'S TAKE: July's jobs figures follow a solid round of earnings reports and stress-test results from the banks this summer. But the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union left the economic landscape there in the balance and led many analysts to believe the Fed would stay cautious on raising rates. A second-quarter roundup can be found here.  Still, the outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain, even though the banks' second-quarter results portrayed a relatively stable consumer outside of the energy sector. Auto sales have also disappointed recently, and concerns have grown about an auto-loan bubble.Companies from McDonald's (MCD) to Starbucks (SBUX) to Delta Air Lines (DAL) have cited the U.S. election, Brexit, and fears of violence in the U.S. and abroad as potentially affecting their business plans and consumer sentiment.

357,MS,"Shares of Bank of America (BAC) rallied after the company reported estimate-beating second-quarter results, and it said that borrower credit quality that ""remained strong,"" echoing remarks from JPMorgan (JPM) last week.The bank's earnings per share fell 20% to 36 cents, but that was better than the drop to 33 cents that analysts expected. Revenue slipped 7% to $20.6 billion, above estimates for $20.4 billion.Bank of America's trading revenue rose 14%, led by a 27% jump in fixed-income trading. Equities trading revenue fell 8%, although active trading last month due to the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" vote prevented a steeper drop, according to the Wall Street Journal. Total loans and leases crept up 2.5% to $903 billion, and the bank cut costs 3% to $13.5 billion.Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the bank dealt with ""a challenging environment"" during the quarter. Banks' financial results have been constrained as the Federal Reserve remains less aggressive on hiking interest rates.Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) also report on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.Bank of America stock closed up 3.3% on the stock market today. Goldman rose 1%, while Morgan Stanley ticked up 0.7%. JPMorgan dipped 0.3%.
"
358,MS,"Strength in JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) second-quarter results -- particularly in trading and loan growth -- could bode well for rivals like Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), analysts say.But low interest rates could continue to weigh on net interest margins, even as JPMorgan tries to compensate through loan growth.What's more, banks' underwriting standards differ. While JPMorgan has tried harder to target higher-quality borrowers, analysts will likely be on the lookout for any signs of cracks in consumer credit from other banks as delinquencies in auto loans and credit cards creep up.""What I'll be watching closely is the credit quality side,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said. ""Is there evidence that others are seeing some credit deterioration, which might point to the fact that JPM's credit quality is just better, or are you just seeing it stay fairly pristine across the board?""Shares closed up 1.5% in the stock market today. The other big banks followed, with investors hoping JPMorgan's results could lend some insight into the broader economy. Bank of America rose 1.6%. Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report quarterly results on Friday, climbed 2.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Morgan Stanley added 3.1%, and Goldman Sachs gained 2.9%.IBD'S TAKE: While banks face the prospect of low interest rates for an even longer period, top lenders like Citigroup and JPMorgan may get more generous with capital returns to shareholders.JPMorgan's earnings per share edged up unexpectedly to $1.55 in the second quarter, the company said Thursday, far better than analyst expectations for a 7% drop to $1.43. Revenue rose 2% to $24.38 billion. Adjusted revenue of $25.21 billion was above views for $24.16 billion.JPMorgan's gains were led by consumer loans and trading revenue. Total loans grew by 11% on gains in its mortgage banking, credit cards and auto-lending segments.Trading revenue rose 23%, with fixed-income revenues jumping 35%, in part on gains in currencies, emerging markets and ""better market conditions.""The surge in fixed-income, currency and commodities-trading revenue ""should be a positive read across to BAC and C due to their relative strength in macro products,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a report.Firming oil and bond prices likely also helped boost results. While the bank said it was too soon to forecast what it will do in response to the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, Brexit-related market swings may have played a small part to help trading.""Volatility can sometimes be good and sometimes be bad for trading,"" Stemm said. ""It can be very good for trading when sentiment bounces back quickly, which is exactly what happened with Brexit.""And after years of financial-crisis-induced expenses associated with litigation, JPMorgan booked a $430 million benefit from legal expenses during the quarter.However, advisory fees were flat during the quarter, while equity underwriting revenue dropped 37% as global uncertainty spooked more companies out of merging or going public.And JPMorgan's Q2 net-interest margin -- the difference between interest a bank pays out and takes in -- widened to 2.13% from 2% a year ago. But the metric fell from 2.17% in Q1. The Federal Reserve's decision to lay off more-aggressive interest-rate hikes, amid concerns about economic growth, has strained banks' net interest margins.CEO Jamie Dimon said in the company's earnings release that ""outside of energy, both wholesale and consumer credit quality remained very good."" However, the company's provision for credit losses -- the money that banks reserve as a cushion to guard against bad loans -- jumped roughly 50% to $1.4 billion.""Nothing there was concerning to us,"" Stemm said of the extra money set aside. Much of that money, she said, was set aside for the debt-ridden oil and gas sector or expected credit-card losses that generally come as that market grows and matures.But she added that the low levels of credit and loan losses that banks have enjoyed in the past may be approaching an end.""On the flip side, we'll definitely admit credit quality can't get much better than it is today,"" she said.
"
359,MS,"Big-cap biotech Biogen (BIIB) beat Q2 earnings estimates and raised guidance, while its CEO announced his departure Thursday amid takeover speculation, sending shares up Thursday.CEO George Scangos will be leaving the company once it's identified a successor, the company said. Scangos joined Biogen six years ago and oversaw a boom period that produced substantial growth and the launch of several new products, including the much-heralded oral multiple-sclerosis treatment Tecfidera.Lately, however, MS sales have slumped and Biogen's pipeline has produced mixed results. Some high-ranking executives have already left. Still, Scangos' departure surprised many on Wall Street, and many saw it as a sign the company might be acquired.IBD'S TAKE: After a long slide, biotech stocks have been consolidating. The iShares biotech ETF IBB is trying to break out of a long bottoming consolidation, though it remains below its 200-day line.""We think Street will view this as a slightly increased chance of Biogen strategic optionality (but fully expect company to hire new CEO so stock would trade based on what 'type' of CEO they eventually bring in and whether the person is more science (oriented) or more operational and (has a) history of M&A),"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note.Biogen reported its first across-the-board financial beat in some time. Earnings per share came in nearly 12% above consensus and were up 23% from the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 11% and topped estimates by a more modest 4%.Biogen also raised its full-year EPS and sales guidance by single-digit percentages. It also announced a $5 billion share buyback over the next three years.Biogen stock ended the trading day up more than 7.6% to 282.45 on the stock market today, at a six-week high. Biogen moved back above its 200-day moving average, a key support area that the stock has rarely been above for the past year.
"
360,MS,"After several days of high-profile bank earnings, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all reported second-quarter results. All but Wells Fargo topped profit and revenue forecasts as financial giants weathered lower interest rates and mostly delivered solid trading and loan growth.JPMorgan reported a scant 1% EPS gain -- and the other five banks reported year-over-year declines. But it could have been worse.""We should keep in mind however that the reassuring piece of these bank results is not that they are great, but rather that they could have been a lot worse,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, said in commentary published online last week, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported. ""After all,"" he added, ""we got into this reporting cycle for the banks with estimates steadily coming down in the wake of lower treasury yields and Brexit-centric uncertainties.""Shares of all six banks have rallied since July 13, just before JPMorgan kicked off industry earnings. All but Goldman and Morgan Stanley were down less than 1% by the close on the stock market today. Goldman was down more than 1% to 160.05 while Morgan Stanley ticked up to 28.87.The second quarter ended with the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. That left the European financial landscape unclear and pushed back any plans for a near-term Federal Reserve rate hike. The Fed's cautiousness will likely keep a leash on banks' future earnings and net-interest margins, potentially forcing them to depend on higher loan volume and fees.""When the low-interest-rate environment is pressuring the traditional lending side of the business, the fee-income side of the business becomes that much more important,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said.JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo and BofA all reported loan growth and said consumer credit quality was strong, even though the debt-addled energy sector continued to be a drag. Money set aside for potentially bad loans rose for JPMorgan and BofA and more than tripled for Wells Fargo. While the bulked-up reserves for Wells Fargo largely reflect difficulties in the energy sector, some of the increase for other banks could reflect natural growth in credit markets.And as the industry looks to lift returns on its capital and other profitability measures back to pre-crisis levels, banks also worked to cut costs during the quarter.""In an environment where revenue growth is challenging, cost cutting becomes all the more important as a way to generate bottom-line growth,"" Stemm said.Meanwhile, Bank of America continued to shake off problems related to the housing bust of nearly a decade ago, and others reported lower legal costs associated with the crisis.""The biggest company-specific risk facing Bank of America has long stemmed from mortgages originated by the company and its predecessors between 2004 and 2008,"" Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal said in commentary published Monday. ""We think the company's troubles on that front are over.""With lower interest rates continuing far longer than many expected, mortgage banking could get a lift in the quarters ahead, while fees from IPOs and mergers could pick up as firming oil prices and other factors help ease economic anxieties in the business world.Equities trading, however, was sluggish during the second quarter, with many banks reporting weaker activity in Asia, where China's economy has cooled. But trading in bonds, currencies and commodities rose for JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, which reported results on Monday.The U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union may have helped, with more activity before and after the referendum.""You need this balance or this middle ground where you have some volatility around certain events, but in general the sentiment in the market is still largely positive,"" Stemm said. ""That sort of feels to me like more of the ideal sort of environment for trading results. And I think you got a little bit of of that this quarter, which was helpful.""
"
361,MS,"The fascinating thing about Hillary Clinton's lie that ""African-Americans"" are disproportionately killed by police is that she continues peddling it after the murders of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, which followed the ambush killings of five officers in Dallas.In both cases, the murderers were black men apparently convinced that the cops were out to get black people and who, therefore, sought to exact revenge.President Barack Obama, too, talks about the ""disparity"" that blacks, compared to whites, are more likely to be killed by the police. That Obama -- in lecturing about this so-called disparity -- gets away with ignoring the disproportionate rate at which blacks, especially young blacks, commit violent crime is truly astonishing.Should blacks, at 13% of the population, comprise 13%  of doctors, 13 percent of lawyers and 13% of NBA players? If not, does this mean there is a ""disparity"" that we must address as a society?According to economist John Lott, teenage black males, compared to teen white males, are nine times more likely to commit murder -- and the murder victim is almost always another young black man. What about that disparity, Mr. President?It's also interesting to watch the reaction of those who believe Clinton and defend her position, even when they are confronted with the facts. Talk about -- pardon the pun -- shooting the messenger. When I told someone that, according to The Washington Post, of the 965 blacks killed by cops last year, less than 4% involved a white cop and unarmed black man, he sniffed, ""Why should a cop kill anyone  who is unarmed?""Well, take the case for Michael Brown, arguably the white police-black suspect encounter that launched the Black Lives Matter movement and its mantra, ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot."" Eyewitness testimony and physical evidence show that Brown charged the police officer and attempted to get the cop's gun. Unarmed does not mean non-threatening.It's hard to believe that two Ivy League-educated lawyers, Obama and Clinton, do not understand things like statistics, ratios and how to properly interpret crime data to incorporate the rate at which crime is committed by young black men versus the rate at which crime is committed by young white men.As Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute writes in The Wall Street Journal, ""According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.""This leads us to but one conclusion: Obama and Clinton are flat-out lying. The goal is obvious -- to retain that monolithic black vote, without which Democrats cannot win at the presidential level.Obama cannot brag about -- and Clinton cannot run on -- his economic record for blacks. Under his watch, black poverty is up. Net worth is down. The ""wealth gap"" between blacks and whites is at a 25-year high. And as to the employment of black men, their ""labor force participation rate"" (the percentage of those 20 years of age and over who are either working or looking for work) hit its lowest rate in December 2013 -- well into Obama's second term and his economic ""recovery.""That low was the worst since 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping such records. And since December 2010, black men's employment rate every single month to date  has seen lower numbers than any month under all other presidents dating back to 1972.So, what to do? Change the subject, of course. Make the election about ""social justice."" Prattle on about what Clinton calls the ""school-to-prison pipeline."" Never mind that this drive to induce paranoia among blacks has real-world consequences.As mentioned, already it has helped inspire murderers to kill officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. But it also causes police officers to be less proactive, fearing that they, too, will be accused of unfairly ""profiling"" blacks. Cops pull back. This police passivity means crime increases, the victims of which are disproportionately black, the very people Ms. Clinton claims to care so deeply about.Lies get votes. But they also get people killed.

362,MS,"The big banks' earnings should suffer further when second-quarter results come out this week, but potential highlights include stronger mortgage revenues for Wells Fargo (WFC) and a better trading environment for Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), analysts say.Still, Wall Street will be focused on the quarters to come, with Brexit and extended low interest rates potentially weighing on results over at least the rest of the year.JPMorgan kicks off earnings season for the banks, with its quarterly results set to be reported on Thursday. Analysts see the bank reporting earnings per share of $1.43, down 7% from a year earlier, with revenue down 1.5% to $24.1 billion. Trading and loan growth are expected to help the bank, but competition in the credit-card business could weigh on results, Credit Suisse said in a report Monday.Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo report on Friday. Analysts expect Citigroup's EPS to slide 27% to $1.10, with revenue falling 8.5% to $17.5 billion. Wells Fargo's EPS is seen edging down 1.9% to $1.01, with revenue rising 4% to around $22.2 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Ahead of the earnings reports, legendary investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sought regulatory permission to boost its stake in this bank above 10%.The results will come after JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank (DB) last week warned that the U.K.'s vote last month to eventually leave the European Union could curb the industry's fee income and access to financial markets across the bloc. M&A dealmaking had already suffered leading up to the vote, according to Mergermarket.""We believe the largest driver of stock performance at earnings will be any forward-looking comments that could help shine light on future investment banking and trading activity, or additional expenses, post the Brexit vote,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note last week.A formal U.K. separation from the EU could also hurt finance-industry profits and prompt banks to cut or relocate thousands of jobs. Executives from Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan met with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne last week to discuss ways to keep London's financial reputation intact.And with the vote to exit the EU heightening global economic uncertainty, the Fed is unlikely to raise the benchmark interest rate anytime this year. That, along with other economic indicators, will likely strain banks' full-year net interest margins, the difference between interest banks take in from loans and what they pay to depositors, Fitch said in a statement Monday. Revenue is also likely to suffer, it added.But Brexit-related trading volatility may have been an opportunity for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs during the quarter, Credit Suisse said in a separate report Monday.""A rebound in credit markets (2Q16 was the best quarter for credit market asset prices since 2009) and elevated trading activity in and around Brexit should drive solid sequential quarter growth in trading revenues and profits,"" according to the firm.The other big banks report next week. Bank of America reports results next Monday. Wall Street expects EPS to fall 27% to 33 cents, with revenue down 8% to $20.5 billion. Credit Suisse also expects better trading results and loan and deposit growth for the bank.Goldman Sachs, which reports next Tuesday, is expected to report Q2 earnings per share of 3.02, a 53% jump from a year earlier, with revenue down 16% to $7.6 billion. Analysts expect Morgan Stanley's Q2 earnings per share to drop 24% to 60 cents on revenue down 13% to $8.3 billion. Morgan reports results next Wednesday.Bank stocks rose in the stock market today. JPMorgan edged up 0.7%, Bank of America 0.3%, Citigroup 0.7%, Wells Fargo 0.6%, Morgan Stanley 0.5% and Goldman Sachs 1.2%.
"
363,MS,"Watching a grieving Patricia Smith, mother of slain foreign service officer Scott Smith, was a lesson in pain. Her speech at the Republican convention Monday evening revealed a grief still raw and real. The cutaway shots showed how deeply she touched her audience, bringing many to tears.Her agenda, apart from keeping her son's memory alive, was to keep Benghazi alive. She did her best to shame Hillary Clinton, but some of the boos ought to have been directed at the organizers who thought it was a good idea to put a grieving mother on stage for political gain. Shame on them, too.We make a distinction between public and private people for good reason. Ms. Smith is clearly part of the latter group. Enormously brave in her willingness to share her grief publicly, she nonetheless was obviously not a member of the political classes, with the polish and experience to be at ease in a huge public venue.Her speech quickly morphed from grief to hate -- perfect for the circuslike atmosphere in which conventioneers were all too willing to feed Hillary to the lions. By the end it felt embarrassing and exploitative, a calculated political ploy at the expense of someone being used in the crassest way imaginable.There are many reasons to attack Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, but surely the Republicans can find sources that are more informed and dispassionate in their opinions. They might think, too, about expanding their critique of Clinton's record well beyond Benghazi, which has long since lost steam. Clinton should be held accountable for her entire four years as secretary.Democrats are just as bad -- all too willing to award her an easy A for four years of unexamined service. Both parties are remiss in failing to examine the bigger picture.And Clinton's record is vulnerable. For a woman who walked into the job with one of the world's greatest Rolodexes, she was surprisingly unadventurous. Her list of accomplishments is fairly small. Where are her fingerprints in the Middle East, China or Russia? Her apologists are quick to say that history failed to give her opportunities for real statesmanship, but it is at least possible that she failed to be sufficiently energetic in creating them for herself.Love or hate John Kerry, he has clearly upstaged her. With no plans for higher office, he has had the freedom to take calculated risks. His successes raise the question: Why couldn't Clinton have restarted relations with Cuba? Negotiated the Iran nuclear deal? She erred on the side of caution until caution itself became an error.Clinton's interests are not so much geopolitical as they are issue-oriented. She cares passionately about the global status of women and is sincere in her desire to improve their lot. But it doesn't substitute for a full-scale foreign policy. Clinton uttered the oft-repeated ""human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights,"" at Beijing back in 1995, and a whole generation has grown up since. Beyond that phrase, it's hard to find a Clinton doctrine.The Republicans' inability to move beyond Benghazi is all the more surprising given the unusual amount of evidence with which to judge Clinton's tenure. WikiLeaks cables cover the first part, and the trove of emails covers the entirety. The emails, by now as thoroughly explored as Benghazi, show a woman who was already running for office the day she set foot in Foggy Bottom. Her penchant for surrounding herself with political sycophants -- the rather silly and fawning emails are illustrative here -- meant that she was not taking full advantage of the intellects and experience already in the building.What her inner circle lacked was the strategic thinking and vision necessary to conduct an assertive and effective global foreign policy. She settled for being a good soldier and faithful implementer, ever loyal to her boss.There are plenty of lessons here. Obama's seemingly bold move to appoint a rival as his secretary -- especially when he knew she would likely run again -- suggests an uninspired choice. By accepting a job in which she was somewhat less than all-in, Clinton compounded the problem.Republicans have a rich legacy of foreign policy expertise that has been missing throughout the campaign. Relying on poor Ms. Smith is a cheap trick, unworthy of a party that shaped many of America's great foreign policy victories, and contributes little to what is shaping up to be a pompous, silly and rabble-rousing convention. It need not be this way if Republicans can rediscover that intellect, critical thinking and sound reasoning are crucial parts of foreign policy.

364,MS,"Stocks closed mixed Tuesday amid positive housing data and as earnings reports continued to roll in. Netflix (NFLX) hit the Nasdaq, while Lockheed Martin (LMT) scored gains during the regular session, and Microsoft (MSFT) jumped big after hours.The Dow Jones industrial average held a 0.1% gain, the S&P 500 gave up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.4%. Volume was also mixed according to preliminary figures, running slightly lower on the NYSE, but higher on the Nasdaq vs. Monday.Metal miners, movie-related stocks and oil drillers led the downside in the stock market today, as West Texas Intermediate crude prices slid 1.4% to $44.60 a barrel. Paper, solar and ship transport stocks advanced.After the close, Microsoft jumped 3.5% on a fiscal Q4 earnings and sales beat. The business software titan and Xbox maker earned 69 cents a share on $22.6 billion in revenue, above views for 58 cents on $22.15 billion, respectively. It fell 1.6% during the regular session, ahead of the earnings report. Shares were 6% off their 52-week high, based on Tuesday's close.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), up fractionally in regular trading, jumped 5% in extended trading after its Q2 results also topped forecasts. At Tuesday's close, shares were in buy range from a 654.98 flat-base entry.Netflix gapped down and sank 13% in heavy volume after reporting mixed Q2 results after the close Monday. Earnings topped views, but revenue and subscriber growth disappointed. Shares of the subscription streaming service fell below their 50-day line and are 35% off their 52-week high.Super Micro Computer (SMCI) gapped down and plunged 28% to a two-year low in massive trade, after the server systems maker cut its fiscal Q4 earnings and sales guidance late Monday.On the upside, Lockheed Martin settled for a 1% gain after soaring as much as 3% to a record best, then falling nearly 2% amid cash concerns as it waits on a government contract. The F-35 fighter jet maker reported Q2 earnings and revenue that topped views.On the IBD 50, Facebook (FB) added 1% as it approached the top of a flat base with a 121. 18 buy point. Other gainers included fabless chipmaker Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO), up 3% to a new high, and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU), which added nearly 2% in brisk trade.In economic news, June housing starts rose 5% to an annualized rate of 1.189 million, beating forecasts for 1.17 million.

"
365,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS), the Wall Street bank most reliant on trading, posted a 74 percent increase in second-quarter profit as legal costs fell and fixed-income revenue surpassed analysts' estimates.Net income rose to $1.82 billion, or $3.72 a share, from $1.05 billion, or $1.98, a year earlier, when the company had a $1.45 billion provision for legal and other regulatory matters, New York-based Goldman Sachs said Tuesday in a statement. Eighteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated per-share earnings of $3.05.Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 61, is trying to ride out a years-long slump in bond trading by dismissing employees, investing in technology and carrying out the biggest expense cuts in years. More than 400 employees have been dropped this year, including traders and salespeople in the securities unit.""We achieved solid results by continuing to serve our clients across our diversified franchise and by managing our business efficiently,"" Blankfein said in the statement.Goldman Sachs's struggles with fixed income show how idiosyncrasies in Wall Street's elite club can mean the difference between billions of dollars in revenue, and they highlight a challenge to the firm's business model. The franchise that trades bonds, currencies and commodities -- which once fueled record profits -- has dropped behind top U.S. competitors in recent years, leaving its market share in the 12 months through March the smallest since the financial crisis.Net revenue in the second quarter dropped 13 percent to $7.93 billion. Fixed-income trading revenue rose 33 percent to $1.93 billion. Equities trading generated $1.75 billion, an 11 percent drop. The trading figures exclude an accounting adjustment in last year's second quarter.The bank completed the purchase of the online bank of General Electric (GE) in the second quarter, adding more than $16 billion in deposits in one of the most-watched strategy shifts at Goldman Sachs, which became a bank holding company after the financial crisis. The firm is also developing a consumer-lending operation as it seeks to do more business with Main Street.IBD's TAKE: Goldman Sachs shares have been rising, but are still below their declining 200-day moving average, where they've been stuck for the past eight months. While we focus on Wall Street, the best-looking Money Center banks are all Canadian, including Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY). Both are setting up in consolidations.Goldman Sachs fell 9.4 percent this year through Monday, compared with a 1.1 percent decline for the S&P 500 Financials Index of 92 firms and a 6.4 percent advance for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Goldman Sachs is the fifth of the six biggest U.S. banks to report results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) kicked off earnings season last week by beating estimates as fixed-income trading revenue and loan growth jumped. Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) also exceeded estimates, while Wells Fargo (WFC) results were in line with expectations. Morgan Stanley (MS) is scheduled to report on Wednesday.

366,MS,"The drug industry's Q2 earnings season launches this week with three of its biggest names: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , Novartis (NVS) and Biogen (BIIB). Their broad portfolios could give investors a preview of how the business in general is doing.The big kahuna, Johnson & Johnson, on Tuesday morning is expected to report 1% year-over-year sales growth, but a modest decline in EPS to $1.68 a share. The stock hit a record high intraday Friday and is up 20% for the year. Credit ""strong pharma trends, and flight to safety and yield,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in his July 8 preview note.Analysts are expecting another good quarter for J&J's pharma business; Novarro wrote that based on prescription data from IMS Health (IMS), four of J&J's biggest drugs -- Remicade, Imbruvica, Invokana and Xarelto -- will beat consensus. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, in his July 10 preview, lowered his estimates for Invokana while raising them for Remicade and Xarelto. But he said he was concerned about the entry of cheaper biosimilar versions of Remicade later this year. Pfizer's (PFE) Remicade biosimilar was approved by the FDA in April.IBD'S TAKE: Most drug stocks have taken a pounding this year, but J&J has proved to be the exception. Last month our Stock Market Today column highlighted it as one of three standout defensive Dow stocks, and it's only gone higher since then.Biosimilars will also probably be a topic of discussion on Novartis' Q2 conference call, also Tuesday morning. On Wednesday, the Swiss drug giant's biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel won unanimous backing from an FDA advisory panel, making it likely to be Novartis' second biosimilar launch after its version of Amgen's Neupogen entered the market last year.Investors will also likely be interested in the performance of Novartis' two newest potential blockbuster drugs, Cosentyx for psoriasis and Entresto for heart failure. Both are first-in-class drugs that were approved in the U.S. last year, though Entresto so far has missed expectations while Cosentyx has enjoyed stronger uptake.Cosentyx also faced new competition in Q2, however, as Eli Lilly (LLY) launched a drug in the same class called Taltz.On Monday, Credit Suisse analysts cut their Q2 EPS estimate by 4% because the launches of the two drugs appear to be costing more than they'd expected. However, they wrote that the long-term outlook for the drugs look good, estimating $5 billion in peak annual Entresto sales. Peak Cosentyx estimates have been running about the same.Analysts expect that, as in Q1, Novartis' Q2 financials will suffer from the loss of patent protection for its leukemia drug Gleevec. Sales are seen falling 3% to $12.3 billion, with earnings down 6% to $1.18 a share.Novartis' stock is slowly recovering from a long slide from its July 20, 2015, peak of 106.84 to its April 1 low of 69.90. Shares found support at the 50-day line and in recent weeks has moved just above their 200-day, closing Friday at 81.61.On Thursday before the open, Biogen is expected to report a quarter of stronger growth but lower expectations, as its multiple-sclerosis franchise has missed expectations over the last several reports.Nonetheless, RBC analyst Michael Yee sees potential upside for its MS drug Tecfidera, and he expects Biogen to raise its 2016 EPS guidance ""from current $18.30-18.60 EPS up more toward consensus around $19, depending on expense cuts."" That would represent a significant improvement over last year's $17.01.For Q2, analysts estimate that earnings grew 11% to $4.69 a share, while revenue gained 8% to $2.8 billion.Biogen stock, after crashing last July, has been trading above and below its still-sliding 50-day line for most of the months since. Biogen did close above its 50-day line on Friday. Aside from a brief late May-early June stint, Biogen has not been above its 200-day for nearly a year.

370,MS,"JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon expressed doubt about the U.K.'s ability to sell financial services freely after the nation voted to leave the European Union, and Deutsche Bank (DB) warned that the Brexit would hurt banks' revenue. But industry executives said they'd work to keep London a major world financial hub.""If we have that passport after Brexit, we likely would not have to make any change at all,"" Dimon told the Il Sole 24 Ore, a media outlet based in Italy, according to Bloomberg.Financial ""passporting"" allows banks with operations in the U.K. to more easily do business with the rest of the European Union.""But I think the European Union will not accept that,"" Dimon continued. ""It will put more conditions on the U.K. and might force banks to become smaller in London.""JPMorgan shares rose 0.65% to 60.58 in the stock market today. Shares of the big banks have struggled to reclaim their 50-day and 200-day lines, as well as the ground they lost following the Brexit vote late last month.IBD'S TAKE: Despite fears of Brexit fallout hitting banks' results, the Fed's latest stress tests showed top lenders like JPMorgan can weather a severe economic downturn and still return billions of dollars in capital to shareholders.While Dimon said he hoped a formal separation from the EU might not happen -- the vote was technically non-binding -- he added that the bank could shift ""a few thousand"" employees to other areas if the impact from the separation got too difficult to deal with, Bloomberg said.What the financial terrain would look like if the U.K. did leave the EU is unclear, but the pound plunged to 30-year lows amid the economic uncertainly created by the vote. Analysts have worried that a decision to leave the bloc would gouge banks' profits, hurt housing prices and force banks to move employees out of London.Meanwhile, executives from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Bloomberg said.They issued a statement saying they would work together ""to help London retain its position as the leading international financial center.""Bank of America shares rose 1.2%, Morgan Stanley added 2.2%, and Goldman Sachs edged up 1%.Deutsche Bank also warned of ""a smaller fee pool"" and ""a lot of uncertainty"" for the banks following the vote, according to Bloomberg.Even before the vote, merger activity suffered in the U.K. amid the uncertainty. During the first half of the year, there were 638 U.K. merger deals worth $58.2 billion, the lowest value in six years and down from record levels last year, the firm Mergermarket said in a report this week.""Firms postponed deals, cautious of the impact exchange rates and questioning what they will actually be buying into, unaware of how future negotiations will affect them,"" Mergermarket said in the report.JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are slated to report their quarterly earnings next week. Analysts will be on the lookout for further commentary on how the Brexit might affect banks' future results.

Citigroup (C) topped Wall Street forecasts on both earnings and revenue.No. 1 mortgage lender Wells Fargo's earnings per share dipped 1.9% to $1.01 after the San Francisco-based bank beat EPS estimates the prior three quarters in a row. Revenue rose 4% to $22.16 billion, just below analyst consensus for $22.174 billion.Wells Fargo's mortgage banking losses shrank. Total loan originations as of June 30 were $957.2 billion. Total average deposits of $1.2 trillion during the quarter were up 4% from a year earlier.Provisions for credit losses more than tripled to $1.07 billion, most on energy sector lending.Wells' net interest margin, a key metric for bank profitability, shrank for a fourth straight quarter.At the end of March, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) head Buffett boosted his company's holdings in Wells Fargo to 504.3 million shares, giving it a 10% stake in the bank, making Berkshire by far the largest shareholder. Berkshire recently filed for permission to raise its stake above 10%, but has no plans to do so now.Wells Fargo shares ended the trading day down 2.5% to 47.71 on the stock market today, falling back below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Wells Fargo has a 28 Composite Rating, meaning it outperforms just 28% of stocks based on key fundamental and technical factors. Big winning stocks tend to have very high Composite Ratings before starting their runs.

Tesla fell modestly for four straight days but still closed the week up 1.7% and above its 50-day line. Tesla rose 3.7% Monday after Elon Musk tweeted Sunday night that he would soon release ""Secret Masterplan, Part 2.""In a strong sign for initial public offerings, Japan-based messaging company Line bolted out the gate on its first day of U.S. trading Thursday, rising 27% to 41.58, then retreated 4.6% Friday to close at 39.65.

Citigroup (C) also reported second-quarter results that topped expectations. Wells Fargo (WFC) matched EPS expectations but missed on revenue, though mortgage banking losses shrank.Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next week.JPMorgan rose 3.8% and Citi shares 5.6% for the week, while Wells dipped 0.2%.The parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut reported a 9% year-over-year Q2 adjusted earnings gain to 75 cents, topping by a penny, on a 3% revenue decline $3.01 billion. Analysts had expected $3.09 billion in sales. But Yum Brands (YUM) raised full-year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 14%, up from a prior outlook of 12%. Same-store sales were unchanged, and Yum said its China unit has started off Q3 well. McDonald's (MCD), which is seeking a partner for its China operations, reports July 26.Yum shares rose 2% to 87.49 for the week, retaking an 85.89 buy point.Airbus (EADSY) won 279 orders and commitments worth $35 billion at list prices at the Farnborough Airshow thanks to a massive 100 plane order from AirAsia. That easily beat Boeing (BA), which got orders for 182 aircraft, valued at $26.8 billion. But orders at the biannual show were weak overall and analysts are concerned that Boeing and Airbus won't reach their projected sales targets for the year. Boeing did well on the defense side, as the U.K. finalized a $3.88 billion contract for nine new P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft.

The carrier said the era of cheap oil boost profits is largely over. Delta said it's aiming for unit revenue growth by year-end. Delta says it will curb capacity growth in Q4, partly due to the Brexit vote's impact on the economy and the pound. But it won't reduce capacity outright.Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) (IBD) forecast Q2 unit revenue that was better than earlier forecasts. American also inked credit card deals that it said would bring in $1.55 billion in pretax income through 2018.Airline stocks have rebounded somewhat from post-Brexit vote sell-offs. They fell Friday following Thursday night's deadly terror attack in Nice, France but still closed up sharply for the week.No one expects the Fed to raise rates at its meeting later this month. And markets don't see much of a chance of a hike this year. But it no longer seems completely off the table. Stocks are at record highs, more than recouping brief post-Brexit losses. Meanwhile, U.S. and Chinese economic data signal solid growth, if not acceleration.U.S. Economic DataJune retail sales rose 0.6%, far better than expected. They rose 0.7% excluding autos and gas. E-commerce and other nonstore sales rose 14.2% vs. a year earlier, the best in a decade. Core consumer inflation matched its highest level since September 2008. Industrial production rose the most in 11 months. Those reports follow the prior week's strong jobs and U.S. manufacturing data.China's Growth StabilizesThanks to massive credit-driven stimulus, China's economy expanded 6.7% in Q2 vs. a year earlier, matching Q1's gain and slightly better than views for 6.6%. GDP growth is still the weakest since Q1 2009, but suggests that the world's No. 2 economy is finding its footing. June data for industrial production, retail sales and lending all were stronger than expected and accelerated from May.Rail operator CSX (CSX) said Q2 EPS fell 16% to 47 cents, but that topped views by 3 cents.

373,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said second-quarter profit fell 1.4 percent, beating analysts' estimates as fixed-income trading revenue and loan growth jumped.Net income dropped to $6.2 billion, or $1.55 a share, from $6.29 billion, or $1.54, a year earlier, the New York-based company said Thursday in a statement. Excluding an accounting adjustment and a legal benefit, earnings were $1.46 a share, 3 cents higher than analysts' average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. JPMorgan shares advanced 2.3 percent to $64.61 at 7:42 a.m. in New York.Revenue climbed 2.8 percent to $25.2 billion, beating the $24.5 billion average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company said average core loans increased 16 percent from a year earlier. The revenue figure included $3.96 billion from fixed-income trading, a 35 percent increase, beating the $3.57 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equity trading rose 1.5 percent to $1.6 billion.JPMorgan kicks off earnings season for U.S. banks, and may offer insight into the industry's prospects for trading and advisory operations after the U.K.'s surprise vote last month to leave the European Union. While JPMorgan executives have said trading rebounded in April and May, that was before the referendum roiled markets and pushed out expectations for additional U.S. interest-rate increases to at least next year. The delay would extend a post-financial-crisis era of low rates that's forced banks to rely on expense cuts to cope with stagnant revenue.IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan shares have retaken their 200-day and 50-day moving averages this week, but it's not at a proper buy point. Investors also should focus on stocks with Composite Ratings closer to a best-possible 99. But with earnings continuing to fall, JPMorgan's Composite Rating is just 36. See IBD Stock Checkup for a complete JPM scorecard. Bank stocks plummeted after the vote and yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record, draining financial firms of interest income. JPMorgan, which lost about 10 percent in the two days after the June 23 referendum, has since recovered most of that decline.""We saw strong underlying performance with record consumer deposits, credit-card sales volume, merchant processing volume and broad core loan growth"" fueled by mortgages and commercial real estate, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the statement.Non-interest expenses fell 6 percent to $13.6 billion on cost cutting and lower legal bills, the bank said. That compared with analysts' $14 billion estimate.Earnings at the corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, climbed 6.5 percent to $2.49 billion as revenue rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier. Markets revenue, which includes bond and stock trading, rose 23 percent. In June, Pinto said that trading revenue in the quarter was headed for a mid-teens percentage increase from a year earlier on strength in fixed income, especially rates trading.Investment banking revenue fell 15 percent to $1.5 billion on lower equity-underwriting fees. The figure was in line with analysts' $1.49 billion estimate.Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are scheduled to report results Friday, while Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are due next week. Analysts estimate the industry will post its fourth-straight profit decline in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The group saw profits fall 12 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.

374,MS,"Stocks remained lower into Tuesday's close but well off the session's worst levels, as Brexit worries draped over Wall Street, hitting major banks such as  U.S. Bancorp (USB) and Morgan Stanley (MS).The Nasdaq was down 0.7%, the S&P 500 0.6%, and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.5%. Volume was tracking higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session. Losers led winners by a 3-to-2 ratio on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.Financials were broadly lower, in particular the big banks. Those stocks were among the most battered about a week ago, when the shock of the Brexit vote first hit the markets. The European Central Bank is weighing state aid for eurozone banks, reports said Tuesday.Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and U.S. Bancorp were down more than 2% apiece, while Morgan Stanley lost more than 3%.Energy, transportation and retail were other sectors at the bottom of the day's performance list.Harley Davidson (HOG) slid 11%, retracing much of a 20% surge Friday, when the stock soared on buyout talk. But an analyst doused those reports, financial media sites said.With fresh worries over the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union, most of the stocks down in big volume were European companies. Prudential (PUK) and Italian utility Eni (E) were down 8% and 4%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase downgraded Prudential to underweight from neutral.Both European companies were among the stocks with the highest volume compared to normal levels in the stock market today.On the plus side, Campbell Soup (CPB) broke out of a cup-shaped base with a 66.85 buy point. Shares climbed 2%, but volume was only slightly above normal.Real estate investment trusts also kept making new highs, and Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) cleared the 36.08 buy point of a cup-style base. Volume was tracking below average, which diminished the breakout.
"
375,MS,"Even in this age of runaway emotions, there are still some people who want to know the facts. Nowhere are facts more important, or more lacking, than in what has been aptly called ""The War on Cops,"" the title of a devastating new book by Heather Mac Donald.Few, if any, of the most fashionable notions about the police, minorities and the criminal justice system can withstand an examination of hard facts. Yet those fashionable notions continue to dominate discussions in the media, in politics and in academia. But Ms. Mac Donald's book of documented facts demolishes many fashionable notions.Consider one of the big talking points of politicians and others who claim that the harsher penalties for people selling crack cocaine than for people selling powder cocaine show racism, since crack cocaine is more likely to be used by blacks.The cold fact, however, is that black political and community leaders, back in the 1980s, spearheaded the drive for more severe legal penalties against those who sold crack cocaine. Black Congressman Charlie Rangel of Harlem was just one of those black leaders who urged these more severe penalties. So did the New York Times, the promoter of many crusades on the left.Fast forward to the present, when both black leaders and the New York Times are blaming white racism for the more severe penalties for selling crack cocaine. If you want to see what they were saying back in the 1980s, check pages 154-159 of ""The War on Cops.""When the political winds change, politicians change. But that does not change the facts about what they said and did before.As in her previous book, ""Are Cops Racist?"" Heather Mac Donald put hard facts front and center -- and those facts devastate many a fashionable notion in the media, in politics and in academia.One of the most popular arguments used in many different contexts is to show that blacks have been disproportionately represented among people stopped by police, arrested or imprisoned, as well as disproportionately represented among people turned down for mortgage loans or for other benefits.Although many people regard these ""disparate impact"" statistics as evidence, or virtually proof, of racial discrimination, suppose that I should tell you that black basketball players are penalized by NBA referees out of all proportion to the 13% that blacks are in the American population.""Wait a minute!"" you might respond. ""Blacks are more than just 13% of the players in the NBA.""Black basketball players are several times more numerous than 13% of all NBA players. This is especially so among the star players, who are more likely to be on the floor, rather than sitting on the bench. And players on the floor most are the ones most likely to get penalized.The difference between the percentage of blacks in the general population and the percentage of blacks in the particular activity being discussed is the key to the fraudulent use of ""disparate impact"" statistics in many other contexts.Hillary Clinton, for example, decried a ""disgrace of a criminal-justice system that incarcerates so many more African-Americans proportionately than whites.""The most reliable crime statistics are statistics on murders, 52% of which were committed by blacks over the period from 1976 to 2005. If blacks are convicted of far more than 13% of all murders, does that mean that racism in the courts must be the reason?On the benefits side, there was instant condemnation of mortgage lenders when statistics showed blacks being turned down for prime mortgage loans in 2000 at twice the rate that whites were turned down.Seldom, if ever, did the media report that whites were turned down at nearly twice the rate that Asian-Americans were turned down -- or that Asian-Americans' average credit scores were higher than the average credit scores of whites, which were higher than the average credit scores of blacks.Such facts would have spoiled the prevailing preconceptions. Many facts reported in ""The War on Cops"" spoil many notions that all too many people choose to believe. We need to stop this nonsense, before there is a race war that no one can win.This is the second of two parts.

376,MS,"Even as the Federal Reserve signals that tougher standards lie ahead for its annual stress tests, banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC) and others could still get more generous with their payouts as the tests become more routine, analysts suggest.After the Fed approved 31 of 33 bank capital plans late Wednesday, JPMorgan announced a $10.6 billion buyback, Bank of America OK'd a $5 billion repurchase and a 50% payout increase, and Citigroup unveiled a $8.6 billion buyback and more than tripled its dividend. Morgan Stanley (MS) hiked its dividend 33% and announced a $3.5 billion buyback.The results ""highlight the capital strength that enabled the sector to broadly increase payout requests,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement Thursday, later adding that banks are ""becoming increasingly comfortable with the annual process.""As massive as the shareholder returns unveiled Wednesday were, there appears to be room for more among giants like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, based on the ratio of dividends and buybacks vs. earnings expected over the next year.Comerica (CMA) and M&T Bank (MTB) lead banks with net payout ratios of 119% each, followed by Morgan Stanley at 105%, according to Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's is 73%, while the ratio for both Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) is 65%, Citigroup's is 63%, and Bank of America's is 49%.Shares of Morgan Stanley climbed 3% on the stock market today. JPMorgan added 1.5%. Bank of America and Citigroup rose 0.6%. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.1%.Even before the stress test results came out, analysts have been expecting the banks to get more aggressive with shareholder returns after finally emerging from the aftereffects of the financial crisis.A CLSA note this month said JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are likely to hand out a bigger chunk of profits over the next four years, meaning greater gains for investors who stuck with them through lean times.Portales Partners this month said it expects banks ""to get more creative in their capital return requests, as the companies are becoming more familiar with the process"" of submitting capital plans for the stress tests, as well as resubmitting them if the Fed has any concerns with risk assessment or whether banks' dividend and buyback plans could overburden their finances if the economy falters.But even as banks push the envelope on capital returns and become more accustomed to the yearly drill of visualizing their state of affairs in an economic crisis, the Fed has warned of potentially stricter capital requirements in future tests.""The Fed noted that, despite general progress, banks still need to improve internal controls around various elements of capital planning,"" Fitch said.

377,MS,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

379,MS,"In the background of another epic bounce for U.S. stocks was the bull market's oldest friend: buybacks.American companies announced $52 billion of repurchases last week alone, following the Federal Reserve's approval of capital plans for 33 financial firms, according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates. That pushed total buybacks in June to more than $65 billion, the most since February.The cascade of announcements came as the S&P 500 Index was erasing a loss that swelled to more than 5% after the U.K. voted to exit the European Union.The Fed's vote of confidence in the ability of U.S. banks to withstand a severe economic shock cleared the way for large firms from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) to outline planned share repurchases last week. Buybacks have been a primary source of buoyancy for the second-longest bull market in history -- a pillar of strength that the Fed has been happy to fuel with dovish monetary policy.""It was helpful to the market in the wake of Brexit that all those announcements came last week,"" said John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management, which oversees about $230 billion. ""The central bank has signaled that they'll do what they can to support markets by continuing to supply cheap credit and bond-purchasing activity.""Resurgent buybacks may help ease or even erase a falloff earlier in the year. Through the first four months of 2016, announced repurchases were down 38% from a year ago.The S&P 500 slipped 3.6% on June 24, the first day of trading after the U.K. voted to leave the EU. That Friday loss marked its biggest daily decline since August. The benchmark index fell another 1.8% the following Monday before reversing course and rising in four straight sessions to end the week. The gauge's 5.1% increase over the period got it back within 0.5% of where it was before the Brexit referendum.Financial shares had the most at stake in the Fed's stress tests, and when the central bank gave the all-clear last Wednesday, they surged on the news. An index of financial stocks in the S&P 500 climbed 3.9% across the following two days.IBD's Take: Shares of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are all trading below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.  All have reported declining earnings in some recent quarters as sluggish economic growth and flat yield curves weigh on results.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) announced $10.6 billion in buybacks, the most out of any financial firm last week, according to Birinyi Associates data. Citigroup (C) authorized $8.6 billion in repurchases, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley said they'll buy back more than $3.5 billion each.The U.S. stock recovery last week also received a boost from investors closing bearish options bets they'd made heading into the Brexit decision. Short sales had reached the highest since the financial crisis amid the uncertainty leading up to the referendum. The S&P 500 also got a lift from deal activity, as Mondelez International (MDLZ) bid $23 billion for Hershey (HSY) on Thursday.Still, U.S. stocks are going to need alternative sources of strength going forward, like improved growth for both profits and the overall economy, according to Carey. The S&P 500 is expected to see earnings contraction of 5.4% for the second quarter, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg.""We're seeing some steps that could prop up the U.S. market in the near-term,"" said Carey. ""At some point we're going to need economic growth and improving earnings to keep the market going higher.""

380,MS,"The U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union is likely to delay a Federal Reserve rate hike but unlikely to be a factor as the Fed weighs the capital return plans of banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C), which all passed the first round of stress tests.The Federal Reserve on Thursday said all 33 banks that were tested had a common equity tier-one capital ratio that would come in above the Fed's minimum in the worst-case economic scenario, which included 10% unemployment and negative rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries.In round two of the stress tests, the results of which will come out Wednesday, the Fed will accept or reject capital plans, determining whether banks can boost dividends and buyback programs.But some banks factored a ""Leave"" vote into their stress-test responses, the Financial Times reported, and Brexit is unlikely to be a factor in the Fed's evaluations.""I think what's built into the stress test is far worse than what would come in the next two years as a result of the Brexit vote,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst David Hilder said.Credit Suisse, in a report released Friday, said the vote could cause a recession in the U.K. as soon as the second half of this year, echoing other forecasts for higher U.K. unemployment, a drop in housing prices, and erosion of earnings at U.S. banks that have operations in London.But the report also cautioned against comparisons to a potential crisis.""We estimate the vote does not represent a systemic shock to the financial system (like Lehman in '08 or Greece in '11),"" Credit Suisse said, ""but it does represent a significant step away from globalization.""Still, Seth Kaplowitz, a finance lecturer at San Diego State University, questioned whether the banks' contingency plans for a U.K. departure were sufficient, noting the crash of the British pound vs. the dollar to its lowest in more than 30 years.""That shouldn't have happened if the bankers were on top of everything,"" he said by phone from Coatia. ""So I tend to think that this caught everybody off-guard -- that everybody was so sure they were going to stay, to remain stable, that they didn't hedge their bet.""Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, two of the big banks that the Fed's stress tests showed were among the most prepared for a financial crisis, led banks downward Friday. Morgan closed down 10%, and Citi tumbled 9.4% in the stock market today.JPMorgan lost 7%, Goldman Sachs 7.1% and Bank of America (BAC) 7.4%. European lenders fared far worse, especially U.K. banks, with Barclays (BCS) down 20.5%, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) 27.5%, Deutsche Bank (DB) 17.5%, UBS (UBS) 13.35%, and Credit Suisse (CS) 16.1%.Even as banks took a beating in the stock market as the pound and euro sank, other analysts urges investors to take a deep breath in a market that had anticipated Britons would vote ""Remain.""""Everything that operated the way that it operated two days ago vis-à-vis the U.K. and every other country in the EU will continue to operate that way for the reasonably foreseeable future,"" said Kevin Petrasic, head of Global Financial Institutions Advisory at the law firm White & Case. ""We should take consolation in that.""And any Brexit-related impact could give banks reason to pause and take stock of themselves -- something he is urging clients, which include big financial firms, to do amid the upheaval.""They do have the luxury, based on the stress-test results, to do that,"" Petrasic said.
"
381,MS,"A U.K. exit from the European Union could weigh most on JPMorgan Chase's (JPM), Goldman Sachs' (GS) and Morgan Stanley's (MS) profits next year and raise questions about regulations, data-sharing and consumer privacy.Media outlets have declared the Leave campaign the winner. The U.K.'s referendum follows years during which U.S. banks have tried to fatten their financial cushions in the wake of the financial crisis. But a so-called Brexit could heighten existing global economic uncertainty and postpone investments.""You might call it a different kind of stress test, I guess,"" IDC analyst Jerry Silva said of the vote last week.Morgan Stanley's earnings per share next year could fall 9% from current 2017 estimates as a result of a Brexit, the most for any U.S. bank, compared with a 7.9% drop for Goldman Sachs and a 6.7% decline for JPMorgan, according to a report from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods released June 16.JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman have the highest percentage of their total employees that could be affected by the U.K.'s departure, with Goldman topping at 4.4%, the report said. A decision to leave the EU would put a choke-hold on U.K. banks' financial ""passporting,"" or their ability to sell financial services freely across the bloc.Big U.S. banks have warned of U.K. job cuts or a relocation of thousands of staffers to continental Europe as a result. Jobs in investment and commercial banking, trading and sales are seen as the most vulnerable, analysts say. But fewer employees of Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are likely to be affected, as they draw a smaller portion of income from their U.K. subsidiaries than their rivals.London's reputation is also at stake. The city, which sits between North American and Asian markets, has been a global financial anchor for centuries, and big U.S. banks have set up shop there for its financial infrastructure, technology and intellectual capital. The language barrier for American bankers is also nonexistent.But a Brexit stands to give other regions more clout as employees are dispersed, potentially, to financial hubs like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris or Cyprus.""London as a financial hub could lose some of its cachet if you get this greater spreading of resources,"" Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said.Among U.K. banks, Barclays (BCS) had the ""highest gearing to Investment Banking revenues, which we believe are going to tank,"" research firm Bernstein said in a report last week about a Brexit's potential near-term impact. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and HSBC (HSBC) also have massive exposures to the U.K., Bernstein said.The U.K.'s departure could force the pound to drop as much as 15% from current levels and send unemployment higher and housing prices lower, compounding the banks' difficulties, the report said.Within continental Europe, Deutsche Bank (DB) and Credit Suisse (CS) are ""very fragile"" as they grapple with restructuring and capital issues, a Main First analyst told Bloomberg.""In fact, uncertainty is the key challenge in regard to Brexit, and this uncertainty will contribute to falls in business and consumer confidence as well as delays to investment decisions,"" Euromonitor analyst Sarah Boumphrey said in an email. ""The protracted nature of any exit negotiations -- which could take up to two years -- will not help the UK economy.""Since the post-Brexit financial landscape depends on those negotiations, the exact adjustments that banks will have to make aren't exactly clear.""The other EU countries are going to need to be accommodating from a regulatory perspective if they want to continue to keep trade somewhere the way it is,"" Biggar said.But others think the EU has the upper hand in negotiations, meaning the U.K. could have to work out separate agreements with individual nations' regulators for banks to operate there. However, banks comfortably shift resources from nation to nation already, and are usually adept at adapting to regulations once they're in place, analysts said.""Ultimately, (given) the way the markets are reacting,"" Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeffery Harte said, ""I think that just getting it out of the way is going to be the key.""On the tech front, regulations could put up new barriers to banks' data-sharing across Europe, affecting analytics and potentially compromising consumer privacy as banks move technological infrastructure from the U.K.""Cloud, for example, is going to be really interesting to the extent that these banks are using cloud to service the entire EU market,"" Silva said. ""With the data privacy in question, can you continue to use cloud services across both the U.K. and the EU?""Opportunity for any bank to take market share from the U.K. seems minimal, as any regulatory churn from Brexit is unlikely to result in banks pulling out of European markets, analysts said.And some think a Brexit won't have a significant long-term impact on U.S. banks or the nation's economy.Boumphrey said Brexit would have only a ""negligible impact"" on the U.S. economy, with real GDP growth next year being only 0.05% lower than it would have been otherwise.""U.K. and eurozone companies certainly are making contingency plans (and) broadening supply chains,"" Argus analyst Peter Canelo said in a report Wednesday. ""And we dismiss the idea that the U.S. economy is so weak that trade delays with the U.K. -- our 7th-largest trading partner with whom we do just 3.3% of all our trade -- will have much impact on U.S. economic growth.""
"
382,MS,"Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) and 27 other banks passed the first round of Federal Reserve stress tests on Thursday, despite losses of $526 billion forecast in the central bank's most dire economic scenario.Investors will now turn their attention to the second round of stress-test results, which the Fed releases Wednesday. Wall Street tends to focus more on that round, as the Fed determines whether the banks' requests for bigger dividends and stock buybacks are reasonable given the impact the firms would sustain under the test scenarios.The Fed said the 33 banks tested this year would sustain $385 billion in loan losses under the 2016 test circumstances, which include a sharp drop in housing prices, 10% unemployment and negative rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries, a notable difference from the tests last year. Consumer loans accounted for 52% of forecast loan losses among the banks, the Fed said.The Fed also noted that its hypothetical conditions were softer on investment banks' profits, but that the negative short-term interest rates were harder hit by the negative rates.""As compared to last year's severely adverse scenario, firms that are active in trading and market activities saw smaller losses in net income as a result of less severe stress in the equity markets, but firms more focused on traditional lending activities were more affected by negative short-term interest rates and greater stress in the real economy,"" the Fed said.Analysts largely expected the banks to get through the first round unscathed, although the Fed could still reject their capital plans next week.Among major banks, Citi came out with the highest Tier 1 common capital ratio -- a way of quantifying banks' most durable assets and the most-watched metric for the tests -- at a 9.2% minimum in the Fed's darkest scenario. Morgan Stanley had 9.1%, Goldman Sachs 8.4%, JPMorgan 8.3%, BofA 8.1% and Wells Fargo 7.2%. The Fed requires at least 5% to pass.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) came closest to falling short, with a ratio of 5%.JPMorgan rose 1% after hours on the stock market today, Bank of America added 1.7% and Citigroup gained 2.7%, and Wells Fargo edged up 0.6%. Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, seen as potentially more vulnerable to recent market swings, were up 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively.The Fed first posed the economic scenario to the 33 banks in January. Banks responded with their stress-test results and capital-return plans in April.""Today's results have reaffirmed what we already knew — U.S. banks are strongly capitalized and remain well-positioned to serve as a critical economic driver going forward,"" American Bankers Association CEO Rob Nichols said in a statement following the release of the stress-test results.""Even under the worst imaginable conditions, banks' strong capital positions and solid balance sheets would allow them to continue lending and meeting the needs of their clients, customers and communities.""

383,MS,"Shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) rallied ahead of the outcome of the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" referendum, with investors anticipating that the nation will vote to stay in the European Union and, in turn, preserve the financial-industry status quo.As uncertainty lingers ahead of the vote, hedge funds and banks are using private exit-polling data for the vote, likely to anticipate any big market moves that might come from the results, according to the Financial Times.JPMorgan rose 2% in the stock market today. Bank of America was up 2.8%, Citigroup 3.7%, Morgan Stanley 2.6%, Goldman Sachs 2.6% and Wells Fargo 1.6%.European banks were also up. Deutsche Bank (DB) jumped 5%, HSBC (HSBC) 2.6%, Barclays (BCS) 3.3%, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) 2.1%, Credit Suisse (CS) 4.3% and UBS (UBS) 3.4%.Deutsche Bank also confirmed Thursday that it will shut a quarter of its German branches, leaving it with 535 vs. an original target of only 500.U.S. banks have warned that many jobs in the U.K. could be cut or relocated if the U.K. departed the EU. Analysts have predicted that such a decision could damage the British pound, send unemployment higher, drive banks' EPS lower and restrict the U.K.-located banks' access to European financial markets.

384,MS,"Politicians and policymakers continued to deal with the ramifications of the U.K.'s decision to vote to leave the European Union, but investors shrugged off ""Brexit"" with stocks enjoying solid gains. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) hiked payouts after the Federal Reserve OK'd their capital plans in the second round of stress tests. Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing. With the ruling, GE will no longer have to follow minimum capital and liquidity requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) label was put on GE Capital in 2013. But since then General Electric has slashed GE Capital assets as it refocuses on its industrial core.GE shares rose 5.6% to 31.49, near a 32.15 buy point.The ISM manufacturing index rose 1.9 points in June to 53.2, its best reading in 15 months. The new orders and production subindexes showed solid gains. The employment measure rose 1.2 points to 50.4, the first positive reading of 2016. The export orders gauge rose to its best level since late 2014. Separately, U.S. automakers reported strong U.S. sales, with most roughly in line with analyst expectations.The June employment report is due July 8, but with the Federal Reserve likely on hold for the foreseeable future, it may not have as great a market impact.The No. 1 sportswear brand topped analysts' profit views by a penny with flat year-over-year Q4 EPS of 49 cents. But sales slightly missed views with a 6% gain to $8.24 billion, the third straight quarter to miss revenue estimates. Currency-neutral global futures orders rose 11%, below estimates. Nike sees high-single-digit reported revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Q1 guidance disappointed. But analysts broadly remain bullish on Nike's long-term story, and management assured on the earnings call that inventory levels were ""clean"" and its basketball business was strong.Nike named Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook as its lead independent director late Thursday. Founder Phil Knight is stepping down as chairman.Nike shares rose 5.7% for the week.Volkswagen agreed to an estimated $14.7 billion in buybacks and fixes for diesel engine models sold in the U.S. after earlier admitting that it had altered software in them to cheat on emissions tests. But the problem is far from resolved. The world's largest automaker still faces multiple lawsuits. And after Volkswagen confirmed the U.S. settlement, Europe's Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska called on Volkswagen to offer similar compensation to VW buyers in Europe, Reuters reported. Volkswagen fell 2.6% for the week.Tesla Motors confirmed late Thursday that regulators are probing a fatal crash of a Model S operating in self-driving mode. The news could have negative implications for autonomous driving broadly. But Tesla still rose 2% on Friday and 12.1% for the week, closing just below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.Mobileye (MBLY), which makes driver-assistance camera systems for Tesla and many others, announced an alliance with BMW and Intel (INTC) on Friday to produce a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021.

Stifel called the move ""appropriately defensive,"" given the movie industry's volatility, among other factors. The deal brings Lions Gate a rival to Time Warner (TWX) premium channel HBO. Lions Gate fell 3.9% to 19.45, while Starz jumped 3.35% to 29.67.Hershey (HSY): The chocolate giant rejected an unsolicited $107-a-share bid from snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ), saying it sees no basis for further talks. Hershey still closed up 14.3% to 111.95 on Thursday, suggesting that some investors see a sweeter offer working.Energy Transfer Equity (ETE): The pipeline company terminated its $33 billion merger deal with gas pipeline leader Williams Co. (WMB) after a court ruled, despite an appeal from Williams, that Energy Transfer was contractually entitled to end the agreement. Energy Transfer shares fell 0.2%. Williams, which is seeking monetary damages, fell 3.5%, largely on the surprise news that its chairman and five other board members resigned.In what some view as a defensive play against Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon.com set July 12 for its second annual deal-loaded Prime Day -- expected to be its biggest shopping day of the year. Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines. Beer sales rose 19%. Wine and spirits sales grew 8%. Shares rose 7.3% for the week, hitting a record high.Late Thursday, Micron Technology (MU) reported $2.89 billion in sales minus items, down 25% year over year, and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items, swinging from a 54-cent gain in the year-earlier quarter. Fiscal Q3 sales missed analysts' forecast for $2.96 billion, but losses topped views for a 9-cent loss.  Micron announced a $300 million cost-cutting plan that includes job cuts.Micron shares tumbled 9.2% on Friday, 5.4% for the week.General Mills' (GIS) fiscal Q4 earnings per share and revenue both beat estimates, and it raised its cost savings estimate to $600 million by 2018, up from $500 million earlier. The maker of Cheerios and Wheaties cereals and other shelf-stable brands has topped earnings estimates in four of the last five quarters. Shares leapt 8.8% for the week to a record high.In contrast, shelf-stable and frozen foods maker ConAgra Foods (CAG) reported lower Q4 EPS that just met views and a worse-than-expected revenue decline. ConAgra affirmed plans to split off its Lamb Weston potato products business this fall, sell parts of its commercial foods business and move its headquarters to Chicago. ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations. Acquisitions helped sales, and the company remained optimistic despite any potential impact from the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU. The company has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Acuity Brands stock rose 1.45% for the week.Paychex: Outsourcing services firm Paychex (PAYX) said Q4 EPS climbed 11% to 49 cents, in line with views. Revenue increased 9% to $753.9 million, beating estimates. The stock popped on the report, trading up 8.8% for the week to 59.44, the best since late 2000. That's also more than 8% past a consolidation buy point at 54.88.

385,MS,"Thursday, like the month of June as a whole, came in like a lamb and went out like a lion for major stock ETFs. Investors digested news that more stimulus efforts may be coming from the Bank of England.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) bolted 1.4% higher into the close, after creeping up in morning trade. Its underlying index recovered for a third straight day following a sharp Brexit-inspired sell-off.SPY eked out a 0.4% gain for June after clawing back most of the steep losses that followed Britons' vote to leave the European Union. The bellwether U.S. exchange traded fund posted a 2.5% gain for the second quarter -- its third positive quarter in a row -- and a 3.8% gain for 2016 so far.Financial stocks took the ETF spotlight Thursday as investors cheered news that a majority of 33 banks passed the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, opening the door to a dividend and share buyback windfall.The largest financial sector exchange traded fund wobbled between gains and losses in early Thursday trade, but closed a solid 1.6% higher.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) has a 33% weighting in commercial banks but also holds REITs, insurance companies and capital market heavyweights.Its smaller siblings, focused more exclusively on the banking sector, also advanced.SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) popped 2.3% on the stock market today.SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) added 2.0%.Late Wednesday, the Fed approved the capital plans for 31 of 33 banks. The U.S. units of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) failed to gain the nod, while approval for Morgan Stanley (MS) was conditional.Still, Morgan Stanley announced a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion share buyback. JPMorgan (JPM) approved a $10.6 billion buyback while keeping its dividend the same. Bank of America (BAC) declared a $5 billion share repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup (C) will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) said its plan includes both buybacks and a dividend hike, without offering details. Wells Fargo (WFC) kept its capital plans unchanged.XLF counts many of these bank majors among its top 10 holdings. The exchange traded fund is poised for a weekly gain that would snap a four-week string of losses.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rose again Thursday as it trades near a 52-week high.

387,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are expected to boost shareholder returns at a faster pace than investment banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), top regional banks, and credit card giant Capital One (COF).As investors await the next round of stress-test results Wednesday night, CLSA estimated in a recent report that returns through buybacks and dividends from JPMorgan, BofA, Citi and Wells Fargo could potentially rise to $51 billion over the next year, or nearly two-thirds of earnings, and continue increasing through 2020.The bump in capital return for the big money-center banks would follow their attempts to shore up capital, which helped them pass the first round of annual stress tests last week.In fact, all 33 banks tested passed that round, which quantifies whether banks' capital reserves would meet the Fed's minimum required levels in difficult economic conditions -- including 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries in this year's doomsday scenario. Citigroup led the charge in the improved capital levels.""This reinforces our view that the money center banks offer the greatest upside potential for capital return when capital plans are announced next Wednesday,"" Buckingham Research analyst Jim Mitchell wrote in a research note released Friday.In the second of those two rounds, also known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve determines whether banks could reasonably deliver planned dividend and buyback increases amid financial strain.Buckingham Research, in a note Friday, said the odds were low that big banks of particular significance to the economy would have their plans rejected by the Fed. Similarly, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note on Thursday that most banks that it covers ""appear well positioned to meet our capital return expectations.""""Overall, we believe that stress test results are most positive for (Citigroup), (Bank of America), and Morgan Stanley -- where meaningful increases in capital returns are projected -- but the whole group should benefit if investors view the stress test as becoming less stressful for Universal Banks longer term,"" KBW said.CLSA, however, warned that from 2013 to 2015, one out of seven banks has had qualitative problems in the second round of the tests, even after performing well on a quantitative level.Bank stocks rallied for a second straight session in the stock market today as they and global markets continue to recover from the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. JPMorgan rose 2.8% while Bank of America climbed 3.9% and Citigroup 4.15%. Wells Fargo tacked on 1.9%, Morgan Stanley 2.5% and Goldman Sachs (GS) 2.2%.

388,MS,"Media leaks over who could buy Yahoo (YHOO) -- Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T) or somebody else -- have died down ahead of the web portal's annual meeting on Thursday, where shareholders will likely ask for an update on the sales process.Besides Verizon and AT&T, private equity firms are believed to be among the bidders. The sales process has dragged on since early May. Most reports have cited bids in a range of $4 billion to $6 billion for Yahoo's core internet assets, real estate and patents.Shareholders are expect to approve Yahoo's new board of directors, which in April was expanded to 11 from nine members. Six have been added since March, posing a challenge for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.Yahoo shook up its board in April, agreeing to add four new members at the behest of activist investor Starboard Value. With two current board members leaving, Yahoo in April also changed the make-up of some committees.Yahoo's three-member Strategic Review Committee, which has been exploring Yahoo's sale, is chaired by Thomas McInerney, former CFO of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC). It also includes Eric Brandt, a former Broadcom (AVGO) executive. Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith was added to the strategic review committee in April.Brandt had joined Yahoo's board in March, along with Catherine Friedman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS).Yahoo shareholders are expected to approve the three other Starboard nominees: Tor Braham, a former Deutsche Bank (DB) managing director; Eddy Hartenstein, former CEO of satellite broadcaster DirecTV; and Richard Hill, former CEO of semiconductor gear maker Novellus Systems.Yahoo has a market cap near $35 billion, but the vast bulk of its value stems from its big stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA) and Yahoo Japan.Two private equity firms and a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert -- and said to include Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) Warren Buffett -- were recently reported to be still in the hunt for Yahoo.New internet privacy rules could hinder AT&T and Verizon if they buy Yahoo, some analysts say.Yahoo stock, which touched a three-month low of 35.05 on Monday amid the Brexit fallout, closed up 2.3% at 36.86 in the stock market today.

Lloyds Banking plunged 23% on Friday. Barclays dived 20.9% to its lowest level since February 2009, amid the global financial crisis. Barclays tumbled 20.5% on Friday.

Swiss-based Credit Suisse (CS) lost 8.8% and UBS (UBS) fell 8.2%.The British pound continued to suffer despite comments by British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne that tried to reassure markets after Britain's decision to leave the EU.In his first comments since the Brexit vote, Osborne on Monday said, ""You should not underestimate our resolve. We were prepared for the unexpected,"" the Daily Mail reported.The continued slump was a reaction to the surprise Brexit vote after polls prior to the referendum had indicated that opinion among Brits was trending in favor of  staying in the EU. The vote increased probability that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again, further impacting the sterling.Bank of America (BAC) ended 6.3% lower, and Citigroup (C) declined 4.5%. JPMorgan Chase slid 3.3% and Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 3.7% Monday.

"
392,MS,"Banks haven't delivered much bang for the buck in the past year, and are trying ETF investors' patience some more.The financial sector crumbled to the bottom of the S&P 500 heap Friday after Brexit -- the U.K.'s exit from the European Union -- came to pass. That plunge came on the heels of upbeat news for Wall Street banks: Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Wells Fargo (WFC) and 27 other banks passed the first round of Federal Reserve stress tests, an annual rite of passage that puts them through the wringer.All 33 banks showed they could absorb serious market shocks and maintain their capital cushions even in a ""hypothetical firestorm of 10% unemployment, negative interest rates, deflation, etc.,"" said S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Erik OjaNow financial companies are being seriously challenged on another front. The Brexit result will likely create several headwinds for U.S. banks, according to Oja.""We now see a further decline in long-term U.S. interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar, and low probability that the Fed will raise short-term rates in the foreseeable future,"" he wrote Friday. ""This will further pressure net interest margins at banks, and lead to lower oil prices -- with negative credit effects on banks' energy lending.""The importance of the financial sector to investors can hardly be overstated. It accounts for roughly 15% of the S&P 500. The impact of its policies ripple across from American households to mom-and-pop shops to giant U.S. corporates.Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Global's director of exchange traded funds research, concurs that the Brexit news is sobering for this key sector.""We think financial ETFs with hefty exposure to banks will be negatively impacted,"" he said in an email. As examples, Rosenbluth cites the bellwether Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and iShares U.S. Financials (IYF).XLF sank nearly 5% on the stock market as investors digested the Brexit result. Year to date through June 23, XLF was down 1.1% for the worst performance of any S&P sector.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has risen 4.5%.Banks got beat up as the Federal Reserve kept Americans guessing about its next rate move. In December, the Fed hiked interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. This year, it has waffled about the timing of the next increase. Banks benefit from higher interest rates, which boost their net profit margins.SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) and SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) have slumped  4.0% and 2.3% respectively so far in 2016.A more gloomy rate outlook post-Brexit could spell trouble for regional banks. Although the largest banks did surprisingly well in the latest stress tests, regional banks did not fare as well, Oja wrote.""They had a difficult test with negative interest rates,"" he added. Still, market watchers point out that U.S. banks overall are on solid footing.The heavyweights, in particular, have strong capital positions and solid balance sheets. ""The money center banks are probably in the best capital shape that they have been since the financial crisis started in 2008,"" Charles Peabody of Portales Partners, a broker dealer, wrote in a June 8 note. The firm expects this banking group to be a major source of dividends and buybacks for shareholders this year and next.At BlackRock, strategists expect the UK's divorce from the Europe Union to trigger a long period of political, economic and market uncertainty.They said: ""We see the vote leading to declines in global shares and other risk assets. Yet indiscriminate selling could translate into opportunities. U.S. and Asia markets are only marginally affected by the U.K.'s exit from the EU, and are supported by a mix of easy monetary policy and economic growth.""The immediate negative reaction to the news is exactly what ETF strategists at CLS Investments are homing in on. Both U.S. financial and Europe financial ETFs are looking attractive to CIO Rusty Vanneman.""We're looking to buy,"" Vanneman told Investor's Business Daily on Friday. The firm has been a better buyer of financials in 2016, moving from an underweight to overweight position in the sector. ""Our plan is to get to an overweight, and this sell-off will provide an opportunity for us to add to those positions,"" he added.He finds iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN) particularly attractive from a valuation standpoint given the recent drubbing for the likes of HSBC (HSBC), Credit Suisse (CS) and Deutsche Bank (DB).

393,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) said Tuesday that its risky but potentially transformative multiple-sclerosis drug candidate had failed its clinical trial, driving the big biotech's stock down sharply on Tuesday.Biogen said that its drug opicinumab, better known by its medical acronym anti-LINGO, hadn't met either the primary or secondary endpoints in its mid-stage trial, which measured improvements in physical and cognitive functions as well as disability and disease progression. Biogen nonetheless said that ""evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose-response was observed,"" so it was analyzing the results in hopes of designing another study.Anti-LINGO is a novel technology that promised to be the first to rebuild myelin -- the fatty layer around the nerve cells that erodes in MS patients -- and thereby actually reverse the progression of the disease. Results last year of an earlier trial of optic neuritis -- a form of vision loss in MS patients associated with demyelination -- were technically positive but ambiguous enough that expectations were low going into the MS results.""This was one of the most unknown, unpredictable major clinical events investors were trying to do work on,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""It also reflects the challenging dynamic with the stock for many growth investors in that it is seen as a 'high risk, high reward' pipeline company, and it's hard to get conviction on the events without data despite lots of potential upside if it works.""Biogen's other high-risk, high-reward program is in Alzheimer's disease, which was very promising in earlier trials but is in a disease area with a long history of failure. The next batch of data on that isn't expected for more than a year, though an expected Eli Lilly (LLY) report on its own Alzheimer's drug late this year could provide some read-across, analysts say.Biogen shares tumbled 12.8% to 252.86 on the stock market today. The stock gapped below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.
"
394,MS,"Median shareholder payout from many of the biggest U.S. banks could rise to as much as 77% of earnings from 68% last year if their dividend-and-buyback plans pass the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, analysts say, with money centers like JPMorgan (JPM) and credit-card banks American Express (AXP) potentially leading the returns.And banks' finances are generally seen holding up when the Federal Reserve on Thursday reports the first results of the tests, in which the Fed analyzes how well 33 banks' capital cushions could absorb shocks to the market and their finances. In the second round of evaluations, released on June 29, the Fed not only evaluates whether banks' finances pass muster amid broader economic turmoil but also whether their plans to return money to shareholders would be justified as a result, potentially restraining their ability to repurchase shares or hike dividends.Those passing grades would come despite a volatile market over the past year, rising consumer debt and tougher testing standards. In January, the Fed asked banks to assess how they would handle an economy with 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. government bonds -- stricter criteria than in years past. Banks responded with their plans in April.But analysts feel that the banks are on solid enough footing today to withstand those rigors -- after Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan had to modify their capital return plans to pass the tests last year.""More broadly, we see limited downside risk given that nearly all of the companies under coverage have seen material improvement in capital ratios"" since the previous tests, Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell said in a note Monday.The big money-center banks -- like JPMorgan, Citigroup, BofA and Wells Fargo -- ""are probably in the best capital shape that they have been since the financial crisis,"" Portales Partners said this month in a research note, which predicted that such banks would turn out the biggest shareholder returns.""I'd be surprised if any of the big four had a big hiccup this year,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Werner told IBD, referring to JPMorgan, Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America.Portales predicted that on average, roughly half of earnings this year and next from those banks would come back to shareholders in the form of buyback programs and dividends.Those increases would be in part driven by low payouts last year and an improved capital buffer, Mitchell said. He also said those big banks would see a bigger payout increase, 20%-44% as measured in dollars, than any other kind of bank Buckingham covers.Credit-card banks like Capital One (COF), Discover (DFS), and American Express (AXP), were also likely to ""enjoy above industry average payouts"" over the next year, Portales said.""It's surprising the credit-card banks have been more resilient, even with the large consumer losses that they predict and that they model,"" Werner said. ""I think the capital levels at those banks have generally been stronger, just because of the nature of the business.""But beyond JPMorgan and the credit-card banks, the picture for potential returns is less clear.On one hand, Buckingham Research said Monday that Morgan Stanley had tremendous potential for ""upside surprise,"" citing in part its move away from volatile fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading. Credit Suisse on Monday also said Morgan was among those best positioned to return a high percentage of its capital.However, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods remained cautious on Morgan, after the bank had to modify its capital plan last year. Portales analyst Paul Gulberg told IBD that investment banks Morgan, along with Goldman Sachs, were more exposed to the U.K.'s potential decision to leave the EU and other world market chaos, and could ""get hurt a little bit.""Coincidentally, the U.K.'s referendum on leaving the EU also takes place Thursday. Analysts have warned that a so-called 'Brexit' could roil the financial landscape in Europe and reverberate into U.S.-based banks. Some U.S. banks detailed what effect Brexit would have on them in their stress-test responses, the Financial Times reported this week.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods has also warned that post-stress-test payouts could be topping out.""Overall, payouts are near the upper end of what we believe is the long-term range of 70% to 80% of earnings over the CCAR cycle for the median bank,"" the firm said in a note last month, referring to the second round of testing, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.Payouts this year could also be affected by proposed adjustments to the stress tests' methodology in the future.Federal Reserve governors this month said some large banks could have to set more money aside to pass stress tests down the road. Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a note that while those new requirements might not take hold until 2018, payout ratios could be affected as soon as this year.""The Fed has done its best to not be so predictable with its models,"" Werner said. ""It sounds like it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game – they don't want to banks gaming the models, but at the same time the banks are trying their best to get a more predictable result.""JPMorgan and Wells Fargo rose about 2% on the stock market today on optimism about the Brexit vote as well as the stress tests. Citigroup climbed more than 4% while Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advanced more than 3%. American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial rose roughly 2%.

395,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS) reported first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates as the firm cut costs and revenue from trading stocks and bonds declined less than some analysts predicted. The shares climbed.Net income fell 53% to $1.13 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $2.39 billion, or $1.18, a year earlier, the New York-based company said Monday in a statement. Profit surpassed the 47-cent average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.While Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has been shrinking the firm’s fixed-income trading division to emphasize the less-volatile wealth-management business, Morgan Stanley is still exposed to slumping markets that hurt results across Wall Street. The firm follows JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup (C) Inc. in lowering expenses to compensate for falling revenue. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which reports results Tuesday, is embarking on its biggest cost-cutting push in years, people with knowledge of the effort said last week.Revenue fell 21% to $7.79 billion, compared with the $7.76 billion estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Non-interest expenses fell 14% to $6.05 billion, below the $6.42 billion estimate. Compensation expense dropped 19% to $3.68 billion and non-compensation costs declined 6.2 percent to $2.37 billion.“The first quarter was characterized by challenging market conditions and muted client activity,” Gorman said in the statement. “While we see some signs of market recovery, global uncertainties continue to weigh on investor activity.”

The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market.

Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

399,MS,"Energy remains a drag for Wells Fargo (WFC), which charged off $204 million in energy loans in Q1, up about 75% from Q4, and added $200 million to its energy loan-loss reserves, while the tally of oil sector bankruptcies climbed higher with a filing Thursday from Energy XXI (EXXI).Bank of America (BAC) boosted its energy loan-loss reserves by $525 million vs. Q4 levels to $1 billion in Q1.The collapse of crude oil prices since mid-2014 has battered energy companies. More than 50 North American oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy protection since early 2015, according to a Reuters analysis.Houston-based Energy XXI, one of the biggest shallow-water drillers in the Gulf of Mexico, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday.Despite Wells Fargo's exposure to the oil bust, the San Francisco-based lender beat Q1 estimates, earning 99 cents a share, down 5% from Q1 2015 and topping views by 2 cents. Revenue rose 4.3% to $22.2 billion, beating views of $21.6 billion.Total loans grew 10% to $947.3 billion. Commercial loans rose 19% to $488.2 billion, due in part to Well Fargo's acquisition of General Electric's (GE) commercial lending and leasing unit, as well as its railcar leasing unit.Wells Fargo shares closed 0.5% lower on the stock market today. Energy XXI shares sank 80% to less than 13 cents. GE edged up 0.1%Long considered a bellwether for the housing market due to its robust mortgage portfolio, Wells said its mortgage applications rose 20% to $77 billion, while originations fell 6% to $44 billion. Mortgage fees increased 3% to $1.6 billion.Profit at Wells' community banking division fell 7% to $3.3 billion, while its wholesale banking division profit fell 2.7% to $1.9 billion. Its wealth and investment management division profit fell 3.2% to $512 million.The bank's net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability that measures the difference between what it pays out to depositors vs. what it charges in loan interest, narrowed to 2.9%, compared to 2.92% as of the end of Q4 2015.Meanwhile, Bank of America earned 21 cents a share in Q1, down 22% from a year earlier but beating by a penny estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 8.6% to $19.6 billion, missing views of $20.3 billion.Bank of America's consumer and commercial banking units gained 16% year over year to $4.5 billion, Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. Total loans and leases rose 3% to $901 billion. The bank issued 1.2 million new U.S. consumer cards in Q1, and total debit and credit card activity increased 5%.The positive numbers were enough to send BofA's shares up 2.5%.The downside wasn't that bad for Bank of America, since the result was expected, given stocks' horrendous start to the year. Total trading revenue fell 16% to $3.8 billion, with fixed-income trading falling 17% to $2.4 billion. Equities revenue fell 11% to $1.04 billion. Investment banking revenue tumbled 20% to $1.2 billion.""It was a really bad quarter for the Street across the board,"" said Dan Burrows, a senior writer at InvestorPlace. ""The banks pretty much performed as we expected them to.""As of March 31, BofA's full-time employee count was down 3% to 213,183 workers. Total assets rose 2% to $2.2 trillion.Analysts weren't expecting great things from big banks in Q1, so it's mostly been a case of under-promising and over-delivering. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) beat Q1 estimates when it reported results on Wednesday, thanks to a strong performance in its commercial and consumer units overcoming weakness in trading revenue and energy loan losses.Citigroup (C) reports Q1 earnings on Friday. Investment bank behemoths Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) report first-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.

400,MS,"Environment:  The Sierra Club, one of America’s richest environmental groups, has in recent years helped destroy the American coal industry. In so doing, it's put tens of thousands of middle-class Americans into unemployment lines.The war on coal has also cost investors and pensioners tens of billions of dollars.Now that coal has been brought to its knees, the Sierra Club’s moved on to its next victim: natural gas. Big Green has a strategy to destroy American oil and gas production with the same tactics.Don’t take our word for it: Here is what Lena Moffitt, who runs the Sierra Club's Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, says: ""‎We have moved to a very clear and firm and vehement position of opposing gas. Our board recently passed a policy that we oppose any new gas-fired power plants. We also have a policy opposing fracking on our books.""That's an amazing admission, given that natural gas is a clean-burning fuel that is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and real pollutants, too. There have been no reported cases of water contamination from fracking technology, as even the Obama administration has admitted. But facts don't matter much in this debate.Ms. Moffitt wasn't done unveiling the Sierra Club's master plan.In the same interview with S&P Global Market Intelligence, she admitted: ""We are doing everything we can to bring the same expertise that we brought to taking down the coal industry and coal-fired power in this country to taking on gas in the same way.""‎""I look forward to seeing the same success brought to taking down gas plants to ensure that we're actually moving to a 100% clean energy future,"" she continued. ""That is the one Sierra Club policy that we are all working toward: getting us to 100% clean energy, which, of course, would include no new gas.""So the Sierra Club admits that their agenda is to destroy millions more energy jobs and American industries, and to make electricity production more expensive and less reliable. They are against LNG terminals for exporting oil and gas, pipelines for transporting it, fracking for drilling it, refineries for refining it. Only a few years ago, the Sierra Club and even Nancy Pelosi were singing the praises of natural gas for its environmental benefits. ‎But once it became very cheap and abundant, Big Green changed its tune.Do the industrial labor unions -- the Democrats' other big interest group -- have any idea what this environmental agenda would do to the well-being and job opportunities of American workers? The lost energy jobs -- most of them unionized -- will never be replaced with so-called ""green jobs.""  We already fell for that ruse at the start of the Obama administration.  The Sierra Club strategy would simply mean America would be far more reliant on foreign energy -- which is dirtier than ours.  OPEC and Vladimir Putin will love this agenda.Meanwhile, the idea that America will be 100% reliant on green energy is a deeply delusional and dangerous fantasy. Even after more than $100 billion in government subsidies over the past decade, wind and solar power are so expensive and unworkable that they account for less than 4% of our energy supply. Is America really expected to give up on the other 96%?We thank the Sierra Club for its brutal honesty. These are modern-day Stalinists who will burn down the village to rebuild it. If this group has its way, it will send America back to stone-age energy sources. It will rapidly de-industrialize America, drive up unemployment and make our nation much, much poorer.Wake up, America.  That is the Sierra Club's end goal.

401,MS,"Susan B. Anthony never imagined she would become the most famous advocate for women’s rights in American history.It wasn’t until she was 29 that she gave her first public speech, and this was against alcohol.When she tried to say something at a temperance convention three years later, the chairman stopped her, saying that women were there only to listen and learn.In 1853, she attended the World Temperance Convention, a New York City event that spent three chaotic days debating the propriety of letting women have the floor. The same year, the men of the New York State Teachers’ Association tried in vain to stop her from speaking at their conference.Anthony admonished them: “Do you not see that so long as society says a woman is incompetent to be a lawyer, minister or doctor, but has the ability to be a teacher, that every man of you who chooses this profession tacitly acknowledges that he has no more brains than a woman?”“Anthony was above else a pragmatic organizer and politician,” Sarah Murphy Abbamonte, director of communications for the National Susan B. Anthony Museum & House in Rochester, N.Y., told IBD. “This was a time when women weren’t encouraged to speak in public, let alone lead one of the world’s greatest nonviolent revolutions. She was not wealthy or a celebrity, but built a coalition of women and men that changed the world.”Anthony (1820-1906) was born in Adams, Mass., to a Quaker father and non-Quaker mother, which made the entire family tolerant of different views and committed to social reform, especially in the anti-slavery movement and the push to restrict the availability of alcohol.In 1826, they moved to Battenville, N.Y., where her father managed a cotton factory, but it went bust during the economic panic 11 years later. Anthony took a teaching job to pay the bills, and in 1845 the family moved to a farm near Rochester. The next year she became the headmistress of girls at a school a few hours east in Canajoharie, but she was dissatisfied that men were paid more than women for the same jobs. She returned to the farm in 1849.Though she had suitors, Anthony decided she wanted to remain single and put all of her energy into social improvement, with hopes of living off speaking fees.In 1851, Anthony met Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Seneca Falls, N.Y., after a lecture by anti-slavery leader William Lloyd Garrison. Stanton had organized the first National Women’s Rights Convention there in 1848, and Anthony attended the one in Syracuse in 1852.“The two women could not have been more different,” wrote Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward in “Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.” “Stanton had been born to wealth and comfort and was for many years the housebound mother of seven. She was witty and hospitable … but she was also an uncompromising revolutionary, for improving the status of all women in every area of life. … Anthony was unfettered and possessed of almost manic energy, willing to do the kind of arduous logistical work — renting halls, raising funds, running petition campaigns, speaking wherever she could drum up a crowd — that intimidated most women of her time.”In 1853, Anthony launched a campaign to improve property rights for married women. She lectured and circulated petitions all over the state over the next two years, but the New York Senate Judiciary Committee mocked her efforts when presented with the results. It wasn’t until 1860 that a law passed giving women the right to own separate property, enter into contracts and be joint guardians of their children.In 1858, Lucy Stone, who had done much of the organizing for the national women’s conventions, turned this responsibility over to Anthony after giving birth to another child. Anthony was already working for the American Anti-Slavery Society, but was persuaded she could handle both positions and presided over the conference that year. She then served as the secretary, while Stanton became president.The two women founded the Women’s Loyal National League in 1863 to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to abolish slavery. Anthony coordinated 2,000 activists gathering nearly 400,000 signatures, the largest petition in U.S. history to that time, which led to the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865.After an amendment was proposed to give black men the vote, Anthony and Stanton organized the American Equal Rights Association to push for universal suffrage. Although supported by Stone and former slave Frederick Douglass, it was opposed by women leaders who feared resistance to giving women the vote would harm the chances for blacks.Stone and Julia Ward Howe finally decided to support black men's vote first and formed the American Woman Suffrage Association, helping work for the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870.Anthony and Stanton opposed this, founding the National Woman Suffrage Association to pursue a broader agenda of women’s rights, including divorce reform and equal pay.Their work began to yield fruit when Wyoming became the first state to grant women suffrage in 1869, followed by Utah in 1870. Anthony began giving 75 to 100 lectures a year, traveling largely by train. She was also an effective fundraiser, with audiences impressed by her simple lifestyle, and she trained younger activists to lead.In 1872, Anthony and 14 other women insisted on voting for the presidential election in Rochester. Two weeks later, all 15 were arrested, though the rest were released to await the verdict in Anthony’s trial. It began in June 1873, and Anthony protested that she was not being judged by her peers, since women were not allowed to be jurors. She was found guilty, but refused to pay the $100 fine and wanted to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The judge released her instead.In 1883, Anthony and Stanton traveled through Europe to promote women’s rights, leading to the formation of the International Council of Women in 1888 at a conference in Washington, D.C. President Grover Cleveland and first lady Frances held a reception at the White House.“After two decades of conflict, the two suffrage organizations finally began to converge in philosophy and tactics,” wrote Adam Grant in “Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World.” “Stanton and Anthony were investing their energy in educating the public: Stanton led the writing of the history of the movement; Anthony traveled around the country to lecture and lobby. They saw eye to eye with Stone on the value of an alliance with temperance workers and a campaign focusing solely on suffrage. Anthony came to understand the value of tempered radicalism. … Stone’s daughter and husband successfully negotiated the terms of an alliance with Anthony’s organization, and they merged in 1890 to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).”Stanton served as president for two years, then Anthony took over.In 1893, Congress called for the World’s Columbian Exposition to host several conferences on specialized topics, including the topic of women. The decision was largely the result of Anthony working behind the scenes to line up support through a petition signed by the wives and daughters of Supreme Court justices, senators, Cabinet members and other dignitaries. The World’s Congress of Representative Women at the Exposition had delegates from 27 countries, and its sessions were attended by 150,000 women and men.Anthony retired from the NAWSA in 1900, and her 80th birthday was celebrated by President William McKinley and first lady Ida at the White House.Anthony remained active until her death six years later.On Aug. 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was certified, giving American women the right to vote.“We have reviewed over 800 letters penned by Anthony to understand who she was and how she had the sustained commitment to helping women gain the right to vote,” said Catherine Cerulli, director of the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Leadership at the University of Rochester. “What we found was that she was singularly focused on her goals and would only engage in activities and relationships that would further them. One lesson is that, in today’s society when everyone is distracted by information overload, we shouldn’t try to read or do everything, staying focused on our principles and values. We launched a project in August 2015 to tweet two quotes a week from Ms. Anthony, and in the first month they had 20,000 views, which shows that many appreciate that we can look back to the wisdom of the past in order to move forward.”Crucial American advocate of equal rights for women.Overcame: Attitudes that women should not have a voice in politics.Lesson: Set a goal to leave a legacy beyond your lifetime.“Cautious, careful people always casting about to preserve their reputations can never effect a reform.”

402,MS,"Banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are expected to report poor earnings this week as market turmoil hits investment banking and trading. But investors may pay more attention to banks' massive loans to now-embattled energy companies.Even though oil prices have rebounded from early 2016 lows, cash-flow woes persist for many shale companies that bet big when crude was trading at $100 a barrel. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and several other banks already have set aside more funds for potential energy-loan losses. A key question is how much they will raise loan loss provisions now.Fitch Ratings, in an analysis released Tuesday, said that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will classify many high-yield loans to oil and gas exploration and production companies as Criticized -- specifically, as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss.Justin Fuller, Fitch's senior director of financial institutions, said that the troubles could worsen if nonbank lenders step in and buy Criticized loans, in which case ""banks may see losses crystallize, given the low bid prices on some loans and uncertainty around oil prices.""Meanwhile, banks continue to set aside billions in reserves to cover losses related to bad energy loans, Barclays said.""The noise surrounding energy-related provisions trends in 1Q '16 reached deafening levels across the banking industry when JPM announced at its Investor Day on February 23 that it planned to add about $500 million to its oil & gas related reserve in 1Q '16,"" bringing its total up to about $1.3 billion, Barclays said in an April 1 report.JPMorgan's late February announcement that it would hike energy loan loss reserves was followed by Comerica (CMA), which disclosed in a regulatory filing that if current conditions persist, an estimated additional provision of $75 million to $125 million could result.Morgan Stanley (MS) on Feb. 23 said in an SEC filing that it has $15.9 billion in energy-related loans outstanding. Morgan Stanley added that 60% of the loans are investment grade, implying that 40% were junk-rated. Morgan Stanley reports earnings on April 18.Wells Fargo, which reports earnings Thursday, set aside $1.2 billion for energy-loan losses in Q4. It has $17.4 billion in energy loans, with $24 billion in untapped credit lines.Bank of America has about $21 billion in energy-related loans and about the same amount in credit lines yet to be drawn down. Bank of America also reports earnings Thursday.Citigroup (C) also has $21 billion in energy loans and $37 billion in credit lines yet to be tapped. Citigroup reports earnings on Friday.JPMorgan reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares closed up 1.85% on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. The stock fell to a 52.50 low on Feb. 11 before turning up, but it is still below its 200-day average.Wells Fargo stock rose 1.6%, Morgan Stanley 1.95%, Citigroup 1.9% and Bank of America 2.3%. All are below their 200-day lines.Fitch said that many energy companies with high levels of cash-flow and balance-sheet leverage are at risk of default. ""Classified risk ratings from the OCC could amplify the pain that many leverage E&P borrowers are already feeling,"" Fitch Senior Director of Leveraged Finance Sharon Bonelli said in the report.""However,"" Fitch offered in a positive caveat, ""most large banks have manageable exposure to energy loans, averaging just 23% of tangible common equity in Fitch's portfolio.""

403,MS,"T-10 hrs days until the official start of earnings season and T-5 days until Uncle Sam comes knocking on your door asking for money…..all while the big banks are working extra hard to hold prices nearer the recent highs as the tax deadline approaches….Stocks ended lower last week with the S&P and Dow finishing in positive territory for the day but about 1% lower for the week….energy tried to make a comeback while financials and tech came under continued pressure. In initial trading – stocks gapped UP on the open – continuing to reflect the inverse relationship between the weaker dollar and oil – you see - as the dollar weakens, oil, other commodities and stocks tend to strengthen – but the strength in stocks was short lived as sellers took advantage of the move ahead of the weekend and buyers grew weary.There was plenty of conflicting data to deal with during the week - First we had a bevy of Fed Presidents giving their views on the state of affairs – as they try to show that they are in control of both monetary policy and the dollar – Does the word 'conflicting' mean anything to anyone? (Yellen - FED Chair - says rates are not going anywhere while members of the Peanut Gallery suggest that rates are going up at the end of the month) So once again the conflicting speeches did nothing but cause confusion and frustration among investors as the reality of exhausted monetary policy initiatives begins to bubble to the surface.And speaking of an 'exhausted monetary policy' – Did you hear all of the chatter around how the Yen continues to advance in the face of NEGATIVE interest rates? Yes – ma'am – the BoJ (Bank of Japan) last month introduced negative rates - as another source of stimulus - to try and force the Yen to weaken – thereby helping their export economy – but in a perverse twist of fate – the Yen has only strengthened vs. the dollar which is sending PM Shinzo Abe, Finance Minister Taro Aso and BoJ Governor Hauhiko Kuroda into a rage….And not to be outdone - negative interest rates imposed by the ECB (European Central Bank) two months ago are also NOT accomplishing the stated goals as the Euro continues to strengthen as well – sending Uncle Mario (Draghi) and other members of the ECB closer to the edge.But this leaves us to ask – are the strength in these currencies due to the recent FED inaction over the future of US interest rates or due to healthier Asian and European economies? The smart money is betting the former....(Remember: The expectation of a rate rise in March caused the dollar to rally vs. these currencies - from early Feb thru Mid March....but then - a NO action move by the fed, coupled with a clear concern over the state of the global economy caused the dollar to weaken sending these other reserve currencies higher and this is causing angst and panic among the paparazzi).Next up – we got a range of macroeconomic data points – all showing continued weakness in the economy which did nothing to help investor psyche – add in the chatter from some of the Fed representatives who discount the data and tell us that we are all wrong and that the economy is firing on all 12 cylinders and you have a perfect recipe for paralysis…..How's that working for you?And this week – there is plenty of global macro data points to digest. Retail sales from the US, China and Brazil. PPI's from the US, UK, Japan and China. CPI's from the US, UK, Euro zone, China. Industrial Production numbers from the US, Euro zone, China, Japan. Capacity Utilization and Empire Manufacturing from the US. We will also here from the BoE and the PBoC on additional monetary policy initiatives.Next up - Earnings! and while they tell us that we are NOT in another recession - there is no argument that US Corporate earnings are......As we know - this qtr is set to be the WORST season in 6 yrs.....with earnings projected to FALL by 9% - but with all of the most recent downgrades to earnings - the joke begins again.....You see - In the end – analysts cut the estimates to the bone, lowering the bar and making it almost impossible for companies NOT to beat the expectations and then the street gets to celebrate and the conversation turns to how the season 'wasn't so bad'…… (Psychology 101)Tonight after the bell - we get Alcoa (AA) - no longer considered the bell weather that it was when it was a member of the DOW - but their results will set the tone for some of the large multi-nationals.....The real kicker is going to be the major banks - think JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) which begin their confessional period on Wednesday...…..so watch for much more stock specific activity in the days ahead as the reports hit the tape. In the next couple f weeks - we will get the regional banks, energy and oil companies, retailers, drugs, healthcare, home builders, industrials/conglomerates and technology. What will the multinationals say about the state of affairs in their respective industries and the impact of monetary policy on their businesses – (Think dollar) vs. what will US businesses say about the condition of the US economy and the health of the US consumer?Remember – earnings are now history – they are what they are – what investors and the mkts want to see are the seeds of real top line revenue growth and projections for a more vibrant, robust future vs. continued talk of layoffs and cost cutting to support the bottom line…A quick glance back at mkt action over the past half dozen years and beyond reveals a seasonal weakness right after the 15th….and I would not expect this year to be any different at all…..I mean – What has changed in 8 yrs? Nothing really –Oh yes….the Obama administration will tell us how the economy has created some 14 mil new jobs and that the unemployment rate is below 5% and wages have stabilized and the consumer has never been stronger – and to that I say BS! Because if that were really true then FED policy would be different……rates would have normalized long ago, GDP would not be the pathetic sub 2% that it is, inflation would be greater than the 2% target and we would be seeing strong upward pressure on wages as companies compete for employees – and that is NOT happening at all. In fact – wages continue to weaken because of the massive supply of underemployed and unemployed Americans, older workers are getting thrown out in favor of younger less experienced workers (think expensive senior level people), other jobs continue to get shifted overseas where the minimum wage is maybe $3.50 an hr…Take the banking and credit card industry as an example – every time you call the 800 number – you get someone in a third world country that wants you SS number, your physical address, your IP address and your DOB... and then we wonder how we get our identities stolen?Overnight – Asian mkts were mixed. Japan (-0.5%) continues to be assaulted by a rising Yen sending exporters deeper into negative territory. BoJ Governor Kuroda is keeping a close eye on how a rising Yen is creating instability in the Nikkei and is prepared to act if need be. He will be in NY on Thursday - so expect to hear more from him then. In China (+1.4%) – The gov't released their March inflation data – CPI rose by 2.3% y/y – in line with forecasts while the monthly read fell by 0.4% m/m. The PPI fell by 4.3% y/y marking the 49th consecutive month of lower readings and this news only suggests that we can expect more monetary easing.
"
404,MS,"The World Bank also warned of slowing economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific Rim due to a weaker China.....(more of the same....but it is a reason for some of today's Asian weakness) .European mkts are all in positive territory now that oil reversed its course lower in early trading. The Euro is trading flat vs. the dollar and the expectation of additional monetary stimulus continues to support those mkts. so the focus for them is also the coming earnings season. FTSE +0.01%, CAC 40 + 0.59%, DAX + 1.19%, EUROSTOXX + 1%, SPAIN +1.42% and ITALY +1.74%US futures are higher by 9 pts this morning - in a continued game of 'cat and mouse' ....suggesting that the S&P will try to test the most recent highs of 2075 before the onslaught of earnings begins. Remember - the underlying tech tone of the mkts is suspect at best......Companies that are in buyback mode are effectively out of the mkt for now - so let's see how investors really feel about the quality of earnings and the quality of the global macro data. I continue to believe that we will remain in the 2040/2070 range until we get bank earnings beginning on Wednesday.....And then the real test begins.Take Good Care

406,MS,"Gold swung between gains and losses Monday as a sell-off in oil and advances in equities left investors contemplating the metal’s appeal as an alternative asset.Negotiations in Doha, Qatar, between OPEC members and other oil producers ended without an agreement to limit supplies, a diplomatic failure that threatens to renew a rout in prices and boost gold’s appeal as a haven asset. Equities gained amid better-than-forecast earnings from Morgan Stanley (MS) and Hasbro Inc. (HAS)Gold has climbed 16% this year amid financial-market tumult and concerns over the outlook for global economic growth. Money managers increased their wagers on a price rally to the highest since 2012, taking their optimism to a level last seen before a three-year bear market started.“Overnight, oil was going lower and stocks were down, but the stock market has recovered all the losses,” James Cordier, the founder of Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Fla., said in a telephone interview. “That’s all that happened here for gold in the last hour and a half, and that’s probably justifiable for how we just moved here.”Gold futures for June delivery climbed less than 0.1% to settle at $1,235 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New York, headed for a second day of gains.The net-long position in gold futures and options jumped 13% to 184,218 contracts in the week ended April 12, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later.Assets in exchange-traded funds backed by gold increased for the first time in three days on Friday, rising 5.3 metric tons to 1,765.3 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors have increased holdings by 21% this year.In other precious metals:Silver futures for May delivery slid 0.4% to $16.253 an ounce on the Comex. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum and palladium dropped.

407,MS,"JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM) first-quarter earnings Wednesday pointed to the resilience of the U.S. consumer and economy amid recent stock market turmoil.Kicking off big banks' earnings season, the New York-based lender's Q1 earnings fell 7% to $1.35 a share, beating consensus estimates by 9 cents. Revenue slipped 3% to $24.1 billion, above forecasts of $23.4 billion.But while the top and bottom lines declined, net income at JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division rose 12% to $2.5 billion. Net revenue grew 4% to $11.1 billion.Shares jumped 4.2% and lifted stocks of other bank giants. Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), which report results Thursday, added 3.9% and 2.6% respectively. Citigroup (C), which reports Friday, surged 5.6%. Investment banking heavyweight Morgan Stanley (MS) popped 5.3% and rival Goldman Sachs (GS) added 3.6%.JPMorgan's lending during the January-to-March period surged 11% to $847.3 billion, powered by strength in auto loans, credit cards and commercial lending. Excluding credit cards, consumer loans gained 16%, suggesting that the consumer's appetite for spending and borrowing was undeterred by a tumultuous equities markets.""Total loan growth was unbelievably strong,"" said Erik Oja, an equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That bodes well for global banks.""Q1 usually is banks' strongest in terms of trading, but the horrific start to the year for stocks had Wall Street bracing for a disastrous quarter. In February, JPMorgan warned of a 20% plunge in trading revenue.But on Wednesday, the bank said fixed-income trading revenue notched a 13% drop, thanks to trading stabilizing in March.Still, there is room for caution as stocks have experienced two sharp downturns over the last 12 months. If the trading environment stabilizes, as JPMorgan has indicated, banks should do well enough through the remainder of 2016, analysts said. And the bank overall looks to continue building on its gains.""They’re still serving clients. They’re still growing loans. They’re still doing well in a number of segments,"" said Shannon Stemm, an equity analyst at Edward Jones.The Federal Reserve's decision last December to boost interest rates for the first time since 2006 also helped. JPMorgan's net interest income rose 1% to $11.7 billion, mostly driven by strong loan growth and the impact of higher interest rates on cash. Reported expenses fell 3% and head count declined 2% to 237,420 employees.On the downside, the bank nearly doubled its loan loss reserve to $1.8 billion, including $529 million for nonperforming energy loans and $162 million in mining and metal loans.Compared to other big banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, JPMorgan is more exposed to those sectors. Though crude oil has rallied to $41 per barrel from February's low of $26 per barrel, natural gas, mining and metals remain subdued.Despite the mounting losses, big banks are considered large enough and sufficiently diversified to endure the energy bust.Meanwhile, regulators at the FDIC and the Fed ordered JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) to make significant changes to their ""living wills,"" or their detailed bankruptcy plans required under the Dodd-Frank Act.For now, the regulators' findings are expected to be a speed bump and not much more.""We expect all these firms to aggressively address their short comings,"" wrote Jason Goldberg, a Barclays analyst, in a Wednesday note. ""We do not expect material changes to operations or costs.""

408,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning that fell less than expected as consumer gains mitigated investment banking trouble. The lifted shares of JPMorgan and rivals such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which all release Q1 results later this week.JPMorgan Chase earned $1.35 a share, down 7% from $1.45 a year earlier and the first decline in five quarters. Revenue fell to $24.08 billion vs. $24.82 billion a year earlier.The largest U.S. bank was expected to report Q1 earnings per share of $1.26 a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was expected to fall about 5% to $23.4 billion.""We delivered solid results this quarter with strong underlying drivers,"" CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""The consumer businesses continue to grow loans and deposits impressively, attracting deposits faster than the industry. The U.S. consumer remains healthy and consumer credit trends are favorable.""The bank's consumer and community banking division reported a 12% rise in net income and 4% gain in revenue.JPMorgan shares rose 4.2% on the stock market today to a 3-month high.JPMorgan nearly doubled loan loss reserves to $1.8 billion from $959 million a year earlier. That included $529 million for energy loans and $162 million in metal and mining loans. It February the bank said  that it planned to boost reserves for potential loan losses by $500 million for energy companies and $100 million for mining and metals.Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup all have large outstanding loans, though most analysts have said banking giants have plenty of capital to absorb energy-related loan losses. Banks also have been cutting credit lines to oil and gas exploration and production companies to limit exposure, though that could create hardship in the oil patch.JPMorgan also said banking revenue fell 19%, with investment banking revenue down 24%. The bank had said previously that investment-banking fee revenue was likely to fall 25%, with trading revenue off 20%.But fixed-income trading revenue ended up down just 13% in Q1. JPMorgan said that trading stabilized in March and so far this month.Citigroup has said trading revenue would likely fall 15%.Separately, the Federal Reserve and FDIC said that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BofA, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and State Street (STT) must make significant changes to their ""living wills."" Major banks were required to submit detailed bankruptcy plans as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. Meanwhile, the Fed on its own said that Goldman Sachs' (GS) living will fell short, while the FDIC on its own did not favor Morgan Stanley (MS). Citigroup did pass, despite ""shortcomings.""Bank of America stock popped 3.9%, Wells Fargo 2.6% and Citigroup 5.6%. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which report earnings early next week, climbed 3.6% and 5.3%, respectively.

409,MS,"The clock ticked and ticked and then at 8:30 am on Friday – the gov't released the all important NFP (Non Farm Payroll) report……expectations were for +200k jobs to be created…in fact they told us that 215k job were created – that's better than the expectation – and the mkt sold off (initially…). But by mid morning – the sell off had ended and the buyers became a bit more aggressive (see the ISM report)……and by the end of the day – Wall St was throwing a party – the Dow +107 pts, the S&P surged by 13 pts – ending the day at 2072 and Nasdaq charged ahead by 45 pts to end the day at 4914. What had changed?Everyone was cheering the jobs report – or were they cheering for lower rates for longer? I mean a strong jobs report would argue for higher rates – and higher rates now would cause the mkt to back off (which is what we saw early on...) – but then a funny thing happened on the way to the forum……Unemployment crept back up to 5% - as more people looked for meaningful work….the spin doctors using this as a positive – saying that the mood has changed – and people who long ago fell off the rolls are now coming back into the work force – or are at least trying (because they are all of sudden encouraged..) And deep within the jobs report – we find the different job categories and how those categories were impacted and what do we see?Manufacturing LOST 30k jobs last month and the bulk of the new jobs were what? PART TIME RETAIL. Do you see the disconnect? Yes – those part time retail jobs ARE jobs…..but the frustration is that we are once again losing good paying jobs for low paying service sector jobs…..and now you ask why wages have remained stagnant for so long? Part time retail sales jobs pay MINIMUM wages – and nothing more - while high paying jobs that do pay more continue to disappear which then puts downward pressure on wages….. So why would anyone think that there is going to be upward pressure on wages at all? So then the theory goes that rates are not going anywhere - just as Janet discussed and BOOM! The buy algo's kick in and the sellers pull back and the mkt rallies.....The funny thing is that Stephen Stanley – Chief Economist at Amherst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:""Any company facing the consumer is probably feeling pretty good about things right now. Despite a choppy economic environment for the past year – employment has been absolutely rock solid"".Did he say 'Rock Solid'? May I ask – what world is this guy living in? Did he even read the report? We lose high paying jobs and replace them with low paying jobs…….and he defines that as 'Rock Solid'? Investors, economists and our very own Janet Yellen – Fed Chair – remain suspect…..in fact many are slashing their estimates for 1qtr growth and for CY (calendar year) 2016.......(see below)…this guy is making it look like a bowl of cherries......saying that part time job creation at minimum wage rates is SOLID JOB GROWTH...Well - fast forward - an hour and half later - and we got the ISM report....at 10 am the Institute of Supply Management reported that the ISM Manufacturing index showed a gain of 51.8 – vs. the exp of 50.5……so get ready – because here is the 'kick'… at 8:30 am - The gov't reports that we are losing manufacturing jobs while at 10 am the ISM reports that we are gaining manufacturing jobs! (Beware the ISM is NOT a gov't report) And the spin machine is hard at work! How exactly are they going to reconcile these two reports so that they make sense? What is the mkt to believe? How can one report suggest weakness, while the other one suggests strength? In the end the mkt believes that jobs, wages and growth remain suspect and that the FED will hold rates steady - so higher we go....Next up - ......1st qtr earnings are expected to be -9.3% followed by 2 qtr earnings down 3.6%...... Full year 2016 earnings are now expected to be +2.2% which is an 81% reduction from the July 2015 estimates of +12% for the full year.Now we know that the analysts always start high and then progressively revise lower - and get to a point that they have lowered the bar so low - it is almost impossible to miss.........but what does this really say about the state of the economy? And if earnings are due to be negative for 2 qtrs...what will they have to be in the second half of the year to end positive? Well estimates call for +3.4% in the 3 qtr and +9.4% in the 4th qtr.....Really? We are going to get this massive recovery during the second half of 2016?Be sure to get a front row seat during earnings season – when companies report on how they did….listen carefully to the number of companies that have or will announce layoffs – Goldman Sachs (GS), Credit Suisse (CS), JP Morgan Chase (JPM),  Bank Of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Blackrock (BLK), Boeing (BA), Peabody Energy (BTU), US Steel, McKesson (MCK) have all announced layoffs - never mind the energy companies that have gotten slaughtered...... while Lockheed Martin (LMT) announced a 'voluntary layoff program'…and let me remind you – none of these lost jobs is a minimum wage job, none of these jobs is part time and none of these jobs are coming back next qtr or the qtr after that…..Mr. Stanley – would you care to comment?With earnings only days away now….I suggest that you pay attention to the top line revenues and bottom line profits – if they miss on the top line yet beat on the bottom line – then that just means that they continue to CUT expenses (wink, wink!) to achieve these 'great' results….US futures are up again this morning - currently +5 . The dollar is a bit stronger and oil is retreating....now trading at $36.71/barrel.....which is giving this latest surge some oomph....The mkt does feel like it wants to test the 2100 level.....before it rests.....and with little or no resistance right now - it is entirely possible we do so before the start of earnings season.....Today 's eco data includes ISM NY, Factory orders - exp of -1.8%, ex trans of -0.5%. Durable goods of -2.8% , ex trans of -1%. ...Not sure - but to me - negative numbers do not suggest strength at all.....Would anyone care to comment?And yes they do....today we get 3 FED mouthpieces...Boston's Eric Rosengren at 10:15 and Dallas Pres - Kaplan and Minneapolis's Neel Khashari both after the bell.Now you will recall that Khaskari was Hank Paulson's right hand man during the crisis and the country rewarded him with the Minneapolis FED Pres position last year. He is now singing a very different tune than he did when he was in the treasury office.....so - expect a lot of chatter after his speech as analysts and strategists dissect it. Dallas's Kaplan is also new on the scene...appointed in September - so the community is still trying to figure out which side of the fence he is on..... appears to be more of a Hawk.....So here we go again......Janet says 'no' and the mouthpieces say 'yes'......expect more confusion and volatility as we move into earnings.Take Good Care

411,MS,"Financial stock ETFs jabbed higher Tuesday as the big money-center banks gear for earnings kickoff this week.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, reports Wednesday. A slew of peers follow: Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Thursday, Citigroup (C) on Friday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, next week.Some market analysts caution that a tough first quarter is likely to weigh on their reports. They point out that the Federal Reserve's wariness on raising interest rates, coupled with global growth concerns, continue to weigh on the financial sector.Energy loans are particularly in focus as banks report, following JP Morgan's recent decision to raise energy-loan loss reserves.Despite oil's rebound from 2016 lows, cash-flow woes persist for many shale companies that bet big when crude was trading at $100 a barrel.Not all analysts share the concerns about the banking sector's health. Some say that U.S. bank stocks are the healthiest they have been in decades.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gained 1.3% on the stock market today. XLF invests in banks, insurance companies, capital markets companies, diversified financial companies, consumer banks, mortgage finance, REITs and real estate management companies.Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) reversed from a 1.5% loss intraday to a 1.1% gain at the close. XLFS invests in the same S&P 500 financial companies as XLF, but shuts out the REITs and real estate management companies.XLF and XLFS are down 5% and 8%, respectively, this year -- putting them at the bottom of the heap of 11 Select SPDR ETFs tracking S&P 500 sectors.One market technician says the chart picture for banks remains poor.""Banks remain troubled and should be avoided based on our work,"" said Ari Wald, executive director and senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. ""We see it as concerning that the KBW Bank index is showing signs of turning lower below its multiyear breakdown point.""Wald said the trend should be considered bearish while the index is below this important resistance. In addition, he noted that while (bank stock prices) have bounced from the February low, the industry’s relative strength has continued to trend lower -- a sign that banks continue to underperform.SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) offers targeted exposure to the banking industry.According to Wald, banks tend to perform well when interest rates rise, and vice versa, making it hard to recommend them in the current economic scenario.""We expect long-dated interest rates to remain anchored by global growth concerns,"" he said. ""Specifically, it’s difficult to make the case for U.S. rates to move significantly higher due to their relatively wide spread vs. ultralow interest rates in Germany and Japan.""As such, he recommended reducing positions in financial ETFs following the sector's bounce from its February low. At the industry level, he suggested buying the property and casualty insurance industry on weakness and selling life insurance on strength.Major stock indexes reversed sharply higher Tuesday as oil prices rose.West Texas Intermediate oil surged 4%, settling at $42.17 a barrel, its highest level in 2016. The gains came as major oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia reportedly reached an agreement to cut output.Energy led the S&P 500 sectors Tuesday. Real estate trailed.Here's a look at how the major exchange traded funds tracking various asset classes performed today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.9%, RS 63PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.8%, RS 63SPDR Dow Jones industrial average (DIA), +0.9%, RS 66IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +1.1%, RS 63IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +1.1%, RS 44IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +1.5%, RS 38Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +1.5%, RS 55SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), 0%, RS 83IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.2%, RS 59PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), 0%, RS 41IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), -3.4%, RS 20

412,MS,"Men may have long dominated the financial advisory field. But increasingly, signs show women are finally getting their shot.Amid a growing awareness of the “female market” for financial advice -- some data show women now controlling 51% of America’s personal wealth -- and the aftermath of some bias lawsuits, evidently more financial advisory firms are inviting women to be advisors as well as clients.“It’s a big deal,” said Michelle Lynch, vice president of Raymond James Financial’s (RJF) Network for Women Advisors. She added, “All the firms have some initiative now around women.”To be sure, female advisors are still comparatively few. Although women comprise more than half the population, they account for only 31% of financial advisors and 23% of certified financial planners (CFPs), according to a 2014 CFP Board report. And experts say that many women still aren’t even aware of the profession.But these days, programs in colleges, professional groups and company recruitment aim to boost the ranks of women advisors. Indeed, at Prudential Advisors, “our goal is to reflect the marketplace,” said Catalina Camoscio, the firm’s vice president of recruiting and development. Reflecting the marketplace would eventually mean “50% of (our) advisors” would be women.At big advisory firms, strategies to attract women -- often part of a firm’s broader “diversity” initiatives -- can include mentoring programs, college recruitment, hiring women returning to work after an extended leave, and the use of team advising.An example of the latter: A year and a half ago, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management (MLWM) expanded its training and development lineup with a Team Financial Advisor (TFA) offering. Participants take on one of five specific roles within an existing advisory team and receive 31 months of training.TFA recruits might include those starting a second career or new college graduates. Among TFA's attractions for women: It allows them “to work collaboratively with other advisors while contributing their expertise to the group,” said Linda Houston, division executive for New England at MLWM.Apprenticeships appear to be among the draws at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (MSWM). For a year, apprentices work with a team of wealth advisors to broaden their skills before starting their own advisory practice within Morgan Stanley (MS). Results so far: about half the apprenticeship program’s hires have been women, reports Kara Underwood, MSWM’s head of diversity. (Morgan Stanley did not provide specific numbers of hires.)This year, Prudential (PRU) hopes to launch its team approach to financial advising and include recruitment as part of it. While this initiative could involve anyone, “we expect it to attract women because of the mentorship and collaboration it offers,” Prudential's Camoscio said.So how can women learn of, and tap, such opportunities? Experts cite key steps to consider:
"
413,MS,"It is POST TIME! That time defined as the 'specific time' when the race begins.....when all participants need to be locked and loaded in the narrow gates awaiting the starters call......Yes folks - its RACE day or rather RACE month....when the CEO's & CFO's must confess the financial condition of publicly traded companies....and on each race day - the grooms - in this case the IR guy/gal leads the 'horse' to the 'saddling paddock'. The identifier checks the horse's identity (listed company) to make sure that the results correspond with the proper 'horse'. Then the horse is saddled up and the jockeys (usually the CFO) are given instructions on how to proceed. The jockey adorned in the 'silks' of the horse's owner ( in this case the CEO) are given instructions on how to proceed and together the jockey and the owner take their places....And they are OFF!Last night - post close - we got the first taste of what is expected to be a tough race.....Alcoa (AA) comes out of the gate stumbling....1Q earnings of .07 cts/sh were down 92%, Yes - earnings BEAT the estimate but top line revenues missed big time......coming in at $4.95 bil vs. the expectation of $5.20 bil....... Klaus Kleinfeld (CEO) discussed weak aluminum prices (down 40% over the last 5 yrs) and the state of the global economy.....2000 jobs are on the line because of weak mkts around the world......The stock fell 4% in after hours trading and is currently trading at $9.34 down 0.40 cts off of last night's close....'and so it was written' the season has begun.....'Stocks popped at the open but the rally was short-lived....stocks failed to sustain the early upside spike and stocks turned lower...sellers dominating the day and selling into the rally. The pullback attributed to the beginning of what is predicted to be a disappointing earnings season.What also added to the sour mood was the double secret meeting between Yellen and the Fed governors. Following this surprise expedited meeting, Janet Yellen met with President Obama to discuss the state of the economy. Now just an FYI - this was the first time since November 2014 that the sitting Fed chair has met one on one with the president....and the media was not invited...so what did they discuss? Rate hike - nah, GDP - maybe, the real unemployment rate? Doubtful - as Obama thinks it's all a bed of roses.....How about the state of the banking industry and how the global contraction has affected the industry....How about the quality of assets, how about margin compression and growth prospects in this less than stellar environment....... especially after two central banks - the ECB and the BoJ initiated negative interest rates. Oh boy.....so much to say....Now as discussed - we are expecting earnings to be down y/y - and as of the end of March - that number has been 'adjusted' to -8.5%....(slight improvement...) Energy, financials and industrials to take the brunt of the blame...... this will be the 4th straight qtr of EPS (Earnings per share) declines....but do not be concerned.....because as usual - expect to see 70% of those earnings 'beat the estimates' - but like Alcoa - will they beat due to cost cutting or will they actually GROW top line revenues? The jury is still out - but my money says - the majority of the 'beats' will come from 'expense management' vs organic growth.....Today we get a bit of a reprieve before the financials line up in the starting gate.....Wednesday - look for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) followed by the usual suspects - Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank Of America (BAC)..... Will weak earnings be discounted? Are we really expecting that 'hockey stick' recovery in the second half of 2016? And if so then this is a gift for the longer term investor...because if this as bad as it gets - then future action can only be UP......unless of course the mkt does not believe it and the guidance is less than stellar.....Now the VIX - is giving us a whole different storyline.....this index (otherwise known as the FEAR Index) - has fallen to a 7 month low.... What its telling us is that the mkts are not concerned about almost anything at the moment and some of the industry's recent surveys confirm this lack of concern.......The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) reveals that pessimism is at a 5 month low of 32.2% - well below the historical average of 39%. Bank of America's ""Bull & Bear"" index recently surged to 4.1, up dramatically from the March low of 0.1......,suggesting the most bullish reading in 9 months. So when everyone is so bullish - what's left??? But buyer beware....this can change in a heartbeat - as any number of things could cause a change in psychology....or sentiment.Yes - it's all nice when everyone plays nice on the jungle gym....but as soon as we get something unexpected then we could see a rather swift and painful sell off...Remember - as I have pointed out - the next two months is traditionally weak and with the US in the middle of a nasty presidential election cycle - so much can happen that will change the direction of the conversation.Risk remains high.....FED policy is uncertain and if the FED is forced to raise rates too quickly - then prepare for the massacre, Europe's economy is on the edge, China is slowing, a Yuan devaluation is NOT out of the question, negative interest rates causing concern around the globe, and continued currency wars and the geopolitical risks of terrorism, war and immigration could easily ignite mkt volatility and are only a few of the risks that exist.US futures are higher by 5pts this morning - no matter what the Alcoa earnings say.....The mkt remains stuck in the 2040/2070 range but feels a bit heavier each day.....a decisive break below 2040 will take us back to support at 2014. Remember - the underlying tone of the mkt is suspect at best......Bank earnings are now the next big thing for investors to watch and mkts to digest.We have 3 FED speeches today....Philly's Patrick Harker at 9 am, San Fran's John Williams at 3 pm, and Richmond's Jeffrey Lacker at 4 pm. Can't wait to hear what prophetic words are on the teleprompter....How will mkts react or have the mkts now decided that all of this FED speak is just noise?Take Good Care

416,MS,"The horrendous start to the first quarter for stocks, coupled with losses in energy and commodities, is expected to kick bank earnings in the teeth as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and others report this week.Plunging oil prices in January and February sent the market into a tailspin, lodging its worst-ever start to the year. Accordingly, a weak environment for trading and capital markets is expected to hurt banks. JPMorgan and Citigroup (C) are among the lenders who have issued warnings on trading revenue.JPMorgan, which reports Wednesday, is expected to see its earnings decline 13% to $1.26 a share, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue is expected to fall 5.5% from a year earlier to $23.4 billion. The New York-based bank’s shares tumbled 10.3% during the first quarter.In February, the nation's largest bank warned that its trading revenue should decline 20% in the quarter. The drop in trading revenue is expected to be exacerbated by the surge of the Swiss franc in January 2015, resulting in tough year-over-year comparisons. But CEO Jamie Dimon said at the time that improved market conditions in March could help.Dimon himself helped out in February, when he bought $26 million of JPMorgan shares.The bank also boosted its energy loan-loss reserves by $500 million for the quarter, though oil prices have rebounded somewhat since falling below $27 a barrel earlier in the quarter.Bank of America, which reports Thursday, is seen earning 21 cents a share in Q1, down 22% from a year earlier, while its revenue is expected to decline 5.2% to $20.4 billion. The Charlotte, N.C.-based lender’s shares plunged 20% in Q1.Q1 typically is the strongest quarter of the year, but weak trading and investment banking revenue this year ""would set up for a tough operating environment through the rest of 2016,"" according to Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, in a research note last week.Wells Fargo (WFC), which is also slated to report on Thursday, is expected to earn 97 cents a share, down 6.7%. But revenue is expected to grow a modest 1.6% to $21.6 billion. Its stock slipped 11% in Q1.The San Francisco-based bank focuses more on lending to consumers and businesses. As a result, it isn't quite as exposed to stock market fluctuations as some of its rivals.But Wells Fargo set aside $1.2 billion last quarter for nonperforming energy loans.Also looming overhead is the constant concern over how many times the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year. After December's 0.25 percentage-point increase, some Fed officials talked about four hikes in 2016. But the stock market's gyrations, coupled with weak overseas economic growth, has led some to speculate that there will be two rate hikes -- or maybe even none.In a healthy economy, higher interest rates help boost banks' net interest margins, a key measure of profitability. A bank's net interest margin is the difference between the interest it pays out to depositors and the interest it charges borrowers.""We want to see higher rates for the right reasons,"" said Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""If the economy is strong enough to handle higher rates, that’s good news for the banks as well.""Analysts at Barclays said they're closely watching Wells Fargo's mortgage activity. UBS analysts last month rated Wells Fargo a sell, arguing that its portfolio is tilted toward risky energy and auto loans. Most analysts remain positive on Wells Fargo.Citigroup will earn $1.06 a share, a 30% decline, analysts expect. The revenue forecast is for a tumble of 11% to $17.6 billion. The New York-based bank’s stock fell 19% during Q1. Citi reports Q1 results on Friday.In March, CFO John Gerspach warned that fixed-income trading is expected to fall 15% in Q1 and investment banking revenue is seen declining 25%.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) report Q1 results next week. Both investment banks are expected to post year-over-year declines in EPS and revenue.Image provided by Shutterstock.

417,MS,"A provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that takes effect in December forces banks to keep a stake in the commercial-property loans they package into securities and sell off to investors. The rule is intended to deter the type of risky lending that helped fuel the last decade’s boom and bust. Under the current business model, banks are encouraged to issue as many loans as they think they can securitize and sell, with underwriting standards sometimes falling by the wayside, said Lea Overby, a debt analyst at Nomura Holdings.“Originators know their product better than anyone, and they are less likely to underwrite really bad stuff if they have to hold it,” Overby said in an interview.The biggest players in the $550 billion market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Deutsche Bank (DB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), are juggling multiple scenarios as they prepare for the new rule, according to bankers with knowledge of the deliberations. Banks may be required to hold as much as $50 million in capital for a $1 billion deal, a tough prospect to stomach with banks under pressure to keep their balance sheets in check. The rule also creates an opportunity for investors to team up with banks on the debt.Turmoil in global markets is exacerbating the uncertainty surrounding how lenders will adjust to the new regulations. The CMBS market is already on shaky ground as the rout in oil prices, slowing growth in China and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s course on interest rates spook investors in stocks and bonds around the world.The extra yield buyers demand to own commercial-mortgage bonds relative to benchmark interest rates has surged to the highest since 2011, meaning investors view the securities as increasingly risky, according to Morgan Stanley (MS). Since January, the spread between the benchmark and CMBS rated BBB-minus, the lowest investment-grade ranking, has jumped 240 basis points, or 2.4 percentage points, the bank’s data show. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Richard Hill cut their 2016 CMBS sales forecast to $70 billion from $100 billion as lenders pull back.Dealers are struggling to sell CMBS deals that have been in the pipeline for months, according to Leo Huang, who oversees commercial real estate debt at Ellington Management Group.“Money is being lost in amounts that haven’t been seen in years,” Huang said. “This should remind people there is substantial risk in this business.”The new requirement, dubbed risk retention, applies to all types of securitization, the process by which debt is pooled together and sliced into bonds of varying risk and reward. Such offerings backed by home loans were ground zero for the financial crisis.The changes are creating an opportunity for real estate investors. Industry lobbyists won a concession from lawmakers to create an exemption for the CMBS market, allowing a third party to take on the risk on behalf of lenders as long as they agree not to sell their investment for at least five years. Banks will be held legally accountable if the firm they sell to violates the rules.The CMBS market has a built-in cohort, called B-piece buyers, that buys the riskiest portions, absorbing losses first in exchange for a hefty yield. Firms including Ellington, DoubleLine Capital and KKR & Co. (KKR) have entered the space in recent years, which was dominated by a handful of specialists prior to the financial crisis. Several B-piece buyers are seeking to raise funds to step in for the banks, though it may be difficult to find investors willing to lock up their cash for five years or more, said Warren Friend, an executive managing director at Situs, a commercial real estate consulting firm.Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan are among lenders weighing the costs of tying up their own capital versus the economics of compensating B-piece buyers for buying and holding large chunks of new deals, according to bankers at the firms who asked not to be identified because talks aren’t public. Banks with larger balance sheets are more likely to take on the risk themselves, they said.Representatives for Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan declined to comment on regulatory issues.One option is for B-piece buyers to buy loans from the banks -- as opposed to just buying a slice -- with the banks selling securitized debt to investors on behalf of the B-piece buyers, said Huang of Ellington, the hedge fund firm founded by Michael Vranos. The bank’s role in the deal would be more of an agent, as opposed to taking on principal risk, Huang said.“Our vision is for banks to do what they do well: using the relationships they have to originate loans and distribute bonds through their sales and trading desks,” Huang said.Some lenders probably will get pushed out of the business by escalating costs, said Overby of Nomura Holdings. Recent volatility has already claimed at least one of the smaller firms. Redwood Trust (RWT) , a Mill Valley, Calif.-based real estate finance company, said this month that it’s exiting the business of making loans for CMBS deals, citing the challenging market and escalating risks. About 25 employees will be cut, the company said.Other lenders are likely to become pickier about the commercial-property loans they issue as the end of the year approaches, said Friend of Situs. That may make it harder for property owners to refinance just as a wave of loans made during the market’s 2007 peak starts to come due, and some borrowers will have to swallow higher costs passed along by lenders, said Friend, who spent more than 14 years as a managing director in the CMBS groups at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank.“Rates will have to go up,” he said, “and the amount of equity they will have to put in the deal will increase.”Related:U.S. Property Companies See Israel As A Promised Land Of InvestorsMortgage Bankers Would Swap More Risk For Lower Fees

419,MS,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

420,MS,"Exposure to energy in Wells Fargo (WFC) and an underwhelming global banking performance for Citigroup (C) factored in as they, along with U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Friday.
"
421,MS,"Wells Fargo said it earned $1.03 a share for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier and beating by a penny the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.7% to $21.6 billion, missing estimates of $21.8 billion. Full-year EPS was $4.15 a share, up 1.2% from 2014's total and matched views. Full-year revenue rose 2% to $86.1 billion, missing views of $86.5 billion.
"
422,MS,"As of Dec. 31, total assets rose 6% to $1.8 trillion compared with a year earlier. Total loans rose 6.3% to $916.6 billion. Total consumer loans grew 2.7% to $460 billion. Commercial loans grew 10% to $456.6 billion.
"
423,MS,"Wells' net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn in loans vs. what they pay out to depositors, slipped to 2.92% from the third quarter's 2.96% and 3.04% a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's decision to boost interest rates by 0.25% last month — the first interest rate hike since 2006 — is seen as helping boost banks' profitability. But the brutal start to the year for stocks, weak global growth and underwhelming inflation numbers could mean that further hikes could be delayed.
"
424,MS,"The sagging energy sector also weighed on Wells Fargo to some degree. The San Francisco-based bank reported $831 million in credit losses in the fourth quarter, up 18.2% from the quarter before, primarily due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses as well as seasonal increases in non-real estate consumer portfolios. Costs decreased 2% to $12.4 billion from $12.65 billion, reflecting savings on employee benefits and commissions.
"
425,MS,"Shares tumbled 4.2% to 48.51 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo's IBD Composite Rating is 64 out of 99, meaning it is outperforming 64% of other publicly traded companies. It is trading well below its 50-day moving average, and that fell below its 200-day line back in September.

426,MS,"Meanwhile, Citigroup reported quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share, also beating views by a penny. The New York-based bank earned 6 cents a share in the year-ago quarter because of legal expenses. Revenue rose 4% to $18.6 billion, beating estimates of $17.9 billion. Full-year EPS was $5.35 a share, missing views by 9 cents, but during the year the bank earned $17.2 billion, its biggest profit in nearly a decade. For all of 2014, Citigroup earned $2.20 a share. Full-year revenue fell 1.5% to $76.1 billion, but beat estimates of $75.6 billion.
"
427,MS,"Allowance for loan losses was $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter, or 2.1% of total loans. A year earlier, that total was $16 billion, or $2.5% of total loans. Citi set aside $250 million to cover losses to its energy portfolio.
"
428,MS,"Operating expenses fell 23% to $11.1 billion, driven by lower legal costs. Loans fell 4% to $618 billion while deposits rose 1% to $908 billion. Net interest margins slipped to 2.92% compared with 2.94% in the third quarter.
"
429,MS,"Profit at Citi Holdings, Citigroup's ""bad bank"" that has housed the company's sour assets since the 2008-09 financial crisis, soared to $704 million from $87 million a year earlier, thanks in part to the sale of OneMain Financial Group, Citi's subprime lending unit. Net income at Citi's global banking unit fell 20% to $1.3 billion and income from its institutional clients group dropped 18% to $1.4 billion.
"
430,MS,"Citi has sought to become leaner and meaner since the financial crisis. It has sold off a number of its overseas assets in order to slim down. Total assets as of Dec. 31 were $1.7 trillion, putting it behind Wells Fargo in that department.

The settlement concerning residential mortgage backed securities reduced earnings by $3.41 per share. Including this total, Goldman Sachs would have earned $4.68 a share, easily beating analysts' expectations of $3.53 a share.Many other banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), reported lower litigation-related costs vs. a year earlier.Goldman Sachs revenue fell 5.4% to $7.3 billion, beating estimates of $7.1 billion. It's the third consecutive quarter of declining revenue.Goldman stock fell 2% to close at 153.75 the stock market today as the major averages plunged and pared losses Wednesday.Trading revenue fell 9% from a year earlier to $2.9 billion as big banks were hindered by stock market volatility.

Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean?

"
463,MS,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today.

"
465,MS,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
466,MS,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
467,MS,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.

468,MS,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.

473,MS,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
474,MS,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
475,MS,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
476,MS,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?Take good careKpYou can get better. It Starts Here""Words of War"" - A special evening in support of comprehensive mental healthcare for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans will take place tonight - Monday, October 19th, 2015 - Freedom Tower - NYC.The Headstrong Project - a veterans charitable organization begun by a returning Iraqi War Veteran - A US Marine - that not only saw but understood the impact that this war was going to have on a nation of Americans, will hold their 3rd Annual Fundraiser to help 'heal the hidden wounds of war'.

487,MS,"The financial advisory space is seeing a lot of change, posing challenges for investors. Robo-advisors are proliferating, evolving (with various hybrids emerging), gaining investors' assets and forming partnerships with big asset managers like Fidelity (FNF) and BlackRock (BLK).

488,MS,"Revenue — and how to grow it — were the name of the game for Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) in Q3, and one bank succeeded where the other didn't.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo earned $1.05 a share, up 2.9% from a year earlier, on a profit of $5.8 billion. Earnings per share beat analysts' estimates by a penny. Revenue rose 2.6% to $21.9 billion, topping estimates of $21.8 billion.The bank's net interest margin fell 1 basis point from Q2 to 2.96%. A year earlier, that number was 3.06%. The net interest margin measures banks' profitability from interest charged on loans vs. interest paid out in deposits. Banks' margins have been squeezed as the Federal Reserve has kept benchmark rates near zero since December 2008.Loans rose 7.7% year-over-year to $903.2 billion, with commercial and industrial lending up 15%, commercial real-estate mortgages up 8.2%, total consumer loans up 3%, and auto loans up 7.1%.Wells Fargo's mortgage business generated $1.6 billion in fees, down 2.7%. Total assets expanded by 7% to $1.8 trillion as of Sept. 30. Expenses grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion.Shares were down 0.7% to 51.50 in the stock market today.Wells Fargo has been buying some General Electric (GE) assets and recently announced the purchase of GE Capital's $30 billion commercial leasing and lending unit. Earlier this year, the bank bought $9 billion worth of General Electric property loans.Bank of America swung to a profit of 34 cents a share in Q3, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-ago loss of 4 cents a share. Net income in Q3 2015 was $4.5 billion.Revenue fell 2.4% to $20.9 billion, beating estimates of $20.8 billion but marking the sixth time in seven quarters that BofA has posted a revenue decline.But shares rose 0.8% to 15.68.Total assets grew 1.4% to $2.2 trillion as of Sept. 30. Residential mortgage and home-equity loan originations rose 13% to $17 billion. Excluding an accounting adjustment, trading revenue fell 3.8% to $3.2 billion — better than the predicted fall of 5% to 6%. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities sales and trading revenue dropped 11%, hurt by declines in credit-related businesses.Expenses sank 31% to $13.8 billion. Legal expenses plunged to $231 million from $6 billion a year earlier, primarily because of the $17 billion settlement Bank of America paid to regulators last year.BofA is seeking to boost its revenue while waiting for the Fed to raise rates. Cost-cutting has been among the methods applied.The bank's core net interest margin fell to 2.10% from 2.37% in Q2 and from 2.29% in Q3 2014.It was an eventful quarter for BofA, which saw its CEO Brian Moynihan successfully fight off an effort by some shareholders to strip him of his chairmanship. The bank also had to resubmit a stress test to the Federal Reserve.Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) will report third-quarter earnings Thursday. Rounding out the big six, Morgan Stanley (MS) reports Q3 results on Monday. Citigroup stock fell 1% Wednesday, Goldman lost 0.8% and Morgan Stanley 0.2%JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported its quarterly results late Tuesday, with revenue falling in a number of its units.

537,MS,"Payments startup Square plans to file an S-1 document for its initial public offering within two weeks, Fortune reported Friday, and what that could mean for microblog Twitter (TWTR) remains to be seen.Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is interim CEO at the microblog while also serving as CEO at Square, which he founded. But Dorsey has been the top pick of many on Wall Street to take on the Twitter post permanently.Should Dorsey be selected to become Twitter's permanent CEO, he wouldn't be the first to run two firms simultaneously. Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and of privately held SpaceX, while also serving as chairman of solar installer SolarCity (SCTY).And Steve Jobs ran Apple (AAPL) and Pixar at the same time.Twitter's directors have said the company would only consider as a full-time CEO someone in a ""position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter.""But Dorsey ""is rumored to be well respected inside Twitter, and he has a thorough understanding of the inner workings of the product,"" Chilton Capital Management analyst Sam Rines told IBD in an email Friday.""Square moving forward with an IPO may force Twitter's board to come to terms with having a CEO with two jobs. There are other tech companies with similar set-ups, and Dorsey has a proper team around him with Twitter's head of global revenue and partnerships Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto,"" Rines said. ""Dorsey may be able to handle both jobs, and the clarity would be a positive for internal Twitter sentiment and external perception of the company.""Dorsey took over in July as interim CEO following the departure of embattled CEO Dick Costolo.When tapped to step up at Twitter, Dorsey continued as CEO of San Francisco-based Square, which Bloomberg said submitted a confidential filing designed for companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue earlier this summer, paving the way for an IPO.Fortune's report Friday said Goldman Sachs (GS) will serve as lead underwriter, with Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also participating.Square's latest round of private funding valued the company at around $6 billion, Fortune said.Twitter stock fell 4.9% Friday to 25.29, below its IPO price of 26.Since hitting an 11-month high of 53.49 in April, Twitter stock has tumbled more than 50%.In July, Twitter posted a Q2 earnings beat, but investors focused on stalled user-growth.In Q2, the company's monthly active user base — including SMS Fast Followers who can get tweets on their phone without being registered users — rose 15% year over year to 316 million, below the 322 million that RBC Capital Markets had expected.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook .

Most had expected the generic version of Acorda's multiple-sclerosis drug to come sooner.""We and many investors have perceived Acorda as having little negotiating power to generate a favorable settlement,"" wrote Leerink analyst Paul Matteis in a research note Monday. ""The agreement that Actavis cannot market generic Ampyra until 2027 represents a best-case scenario for a settlement, in our view.""Ampyra provides virtually all of Acorda's current revenue, running at $437 million over the past 12 months, so Acorda stock responded favorably with a 12% spike to above 31 in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Allergan was down 3% near 279. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which has agreed to acquire the Actavis business in a deal closing early next year, was down 3% near 58.""If the Ampyra franchise really does go out and have increased visibility to 2027, or anywhere in the 2020s, then the current $420 million Ampyra business should be worth more like comparables of four to five times sales, implying Ampyra could be a $1.6-2.0 billion equity value business or $35-44/share just for the MS indication alone,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""Of course, the Phase III post-stroke indication would add significantly to this if that study is positive, given the potential to double sales.""However, Matteis pointed out that there are nine other generic drugmakers who've sued to make generic versions of Ampyra, so the business is hardly settled. He also wrote that it was possible that the Teva acquisition influenced the settlement more than the fundamental legal issues, especially since Teva itself was one of the other filers contesting the patent.""Eliminating one of two filings for Ampyra may be a strategic move ahead of FTC review/approval of the (Teva-Actavis) deal, or could be merely driven by a desire to save money and avoid redundant legal expenses,"" Matteis wrote. ""If this were the case, the readthrough onto other (filers) would be limited; however, we are unsure if this was a motivating factor.""Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

568,MS,"Immigration: Donald Trump got a standing ovation from some 20,000 supporters Monday after vowing to kick illegal alien gangsters out of the country. An alarming new Texas study on the MS-13 threat shows why.Conducted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the study reveals that the nation's most violent street gang — MS-13 — has been energized by the flood of illegal immigrant minors entering the U.S. through Mexico, after President Obama rolled out the welcome mat for them.El Salvador-based MS-13 has now emerged as a ""top-tier"" threat in Texas, responsible for a rash of gruesome machete murders in Houston and other Texas cities.""In 2014, Texas experienced a dramatic spike in illegal aliens crossing into the United States from Mexico and Central America,"" the study warned.""Among those who illegally cross the Texas-Mexico border are gang members and associates, including those associated with large transnational gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13).""The influx of illegal alien gang members crossing the border into Texas, along with reports of extremely violent murders committed by its members in the Houston area, positions the gang as one of the most significant gang threats in the state for this upcoming year. MS-13 gang members are known for highly violent crimes, including brutal murders and dismemberments.""The 57-page report says that some of the illegal immigrant murderers are teens as young as 14. Many of these juveniles, who have killed U.S. citizens, illegally crossed into the U.S. last year when Obama loosened border restrictions. Little wonder, then, that Texans went bonkers for Trump's anti-immigrant gang message at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.The GOP front-runner decried ""anchor babies"" and gang members among the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, drawing huge ovations from the crowd.""You look at crime in so many different places, and you see gangs. Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They're rough dudes. They will be out of here so freaking fast!"" Trump promised to wild cheering and clapping.""You people are suffering,"" Trump told the Texans. ""I'm in New York, but they're in New York, too. They're all over the place.""He's right. The threat from ruthless foreign gangs has become a national concern. Separate reports reveal that MS-13 is consolidating power in Los Angeles neighborhoods and even taking over high schools in the wealthy suburbs around Washington, D.C.With the spread of ""maras"" gang violence, it's not surprising that a just-released CNN poll shows illegal immigration as the defining issue of the presidential race.Almost 90% of Americans say that stopping immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally should be a top government priority, while 52% favor building a Trump-style wall on the Mexican border. That's up from 45% in 2006, CNN reported.Under Democrats, the U.S. has become a dumping ground for violent criminals from Mexico and Central America. Trump's popularity signals that voters are fed up with it.

571,MS,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
572,MS,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
573,MS,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
574,MS,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
575,MS,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
576,MS,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
577,MS,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
578,MS,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
579,MS,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
580,MS,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
581,MS,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
582,MS,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
583,MS,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
584,MS,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
585,MS,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
586,MS,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
587,MS,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
588,MS,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
589,MS,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
590,MS,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
591,MS,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
592,MS,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
593,MS,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
594,MS,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
595,MS,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
596,MS,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
597,MS,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
598,MS,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
599,MS,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
600,MS,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
601,MS,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
602,MS,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
603,MS,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
604,MS,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
605,MS,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
606,MS,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
607,MS,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
608,MS,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
609,MS,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
610,MS,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
611,MS,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
612,MS,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
613,MS,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
614,MS,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
615,MS,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
616,MS,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
617,MS,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
618,MS,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
619,MS,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
620,MS,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
621,MS,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
622,MS,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
623,MS,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
624,MS,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
625,MS,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
626,MS,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
627,MS,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
628,MS,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
629,MS,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
630,MS,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
631,MS,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
632,MS,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
633,MS,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
634,MS,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
635,MS,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
636,MS,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
637,MS,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
638,MS,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
639,MS,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
640,MS,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
641,MS,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
642,MS,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
643,MS,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
644,MS,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T.

That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.IBD: What's your Visa thesis?Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.They've got a powerful pipeline.IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.

"
670,MS,"Scandal: Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills has brazenly threatened to violate a court order and delete State Department emails. What role would she play in a Hillary Clinton administration? Investigation obstructor in chief?Mills, Clinton and Clinton aide Huma Abedin were ordered on July 31 by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan to produce ""all responsive information that was or is in their possession as a result of their employment at the State Department.""Clinton has since told Sullivan that she has turned over all work-related emails from her private account, and Abedin's lawyer has told the media that ""we have been working expeditiously to gather the remaining materials in Ms. Abedin's possession that are responsive or potentially responsive.""Mills' response to the judge? Drop dead. Well, not her exact words, but the essence of what her lawyers are saying. In a letter dated Aug. 6, the attorneys said that ""following our production on Aug. 10, 2015, we have instructed (Mills) to delete any and all electronic copies (of potential federal records) in her possession.""Judicial Watch, which has been forcing the State Department to release the Clinton emails through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, calls this ""one startling revelation.""When told of these plans, Sullivan ordered the three not to ""delete any federal documents, electronic or otherwise, in their possession or control"" and asked for ""appropriate assurances ... that the above-named individuals will not delete any such documents.""The Clinton team has never been fully forthcoming about the personal email account handled by her private server that she used for business while secretary of state.Judicial Watch first filed suit in 2013 seeking records about Clinton confidante Abedin and her employment outside the State Department while working there. The lawsuit was reopened in June at Judicial Watch's request because, in the understated words of Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, ""Clinton's massive email cover-up (was) unraveling.""Rather than cooperate throughout, the Clinton team, with help from the Obama administration, has slow-walked the process. It's as if it knew that a criminal investigation was coming — one has indeed arrived — and wanted to put it off as long as it could.A reasonable person would be justified in thinking that Mills' plan to delete emails was just the latest hurdle thrown in front of the pursuit of justice and transparency.Mills and the Clintons go back a long way. She was Hillary's chief of staff when Clinton was secretary of state, and deputy White House Counsel when Bill was president. She was also part of the legal team that defended Bill during his impeachment trial.Mills has a reputation as a fixer for the Clintons, whom she has worked for since she joined the transition team in 1992. The couple, says Jay Carson, traveling press secretary for Hillary's 2008 presidential campaign, ""trust her implicitly"" and know they can count on her in a crisis.So it's no surprise that Mills would be eager to destroy any evidence that would incriminate or even reflect poorly on Hillary. By now, taking out the trash for the Clintons is likely just a habit for her.If there is nothing to hide in the personal email account that Hillary used for government business, then the Clinton team could have saved itself a lot of headaches and turned everything over as quickly as possible. The resistance, however, suggests something else.In fact, the very existence of Clinton's private server and personal email account strongly indicates there is a something else, namely that Clinton and her aides wanted to conduct State Department business in secret.This sort of behavior is a moral — and possibly criminal — offense in a country where government transparency is held so dear that it is even promised by presidential candidates.Clinton and her aides have to be held accountable for their actions. The reality is that in their arrogance they are telling an entire nation, not just a federal judge, to drop dead.

671,MS,"While drugs for treating and curing hepatitis C have made one biotech company the envy of the industry, another biotech — Celgene — is poised to break ahead of its peer pack over the next few years.
"
672,MS,"Celgene's (CELG) sales and profit growth is seen rising in double digits through at least 2019 from multiple drugs for multiple disorders.
"
673,MS,"Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the biotech firm behind hepatitis C drug Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi — is expected to see earnings slow to low single digits over that time starting in 2016 as patients cure out of the liver virus.
"
674,MS,"Other big-cap biotechs, such as Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), will also fall far short of Celgene's expected growth rate, analysts say.
"
675,MS,"""Celgene has the best top-line growth in all of large biotech right now and will have the fastest revenue and earnings growth over the next five years,"" said Michael Yee, managing director and analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
"
676,MS,"'Next Major Mover'?
"
677,MS,"Piper Jaffray analysts told clients in a recent research report that Celgene is ""positioned to be a next major mover among large-cap biotech stocks.""
"
678,MS,"They noted that Celgene is a returning name ""as a top large-cap pick for us."" Its shares have climbed 19% this year.
"
679,MS,"Celgene has been especially active in developing drugs for various cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases.
"
680,MS,"Two drugs that fight at least one common disease, multiple myeloma, are among its fastest growing.
"
681,MS,"The first, Revlimid, is Celgene's top-selling drug, with $1.44 billion in sales in the second quarter, 19% higher than a year earlier. The oral drug is used to treat anemia and multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood that affects plasma cells.
"
682,MS,"Sales of Pomalyst, similar to Revlimid but more potent, increased 46% over last year to $235 million, making it the fastest growing of the company's current lineup. The drug launched in Japan in June.
"
683,MS,"Other drugs currently generating revenue for Celgene include Abraxane, which treats advanced cancers in the breast, lungs and pancreas; Vidaza, which helps bone marrow produce healthier blood cells; and Otezla, a pill for treating psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis.
"
684,MS,"With sales in the second quarter up 13% from the prior year, to $244 million, Abraxane is one of Celgene's slower-growing drugs.
"
685,MS,"Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn noted that it ""continues to face competition in breast and lung cancer,"" though its share in treating pancreatic cancer in the U.S., now at 50%, has been growing.
"
686,MS,"Analysts expect new indications and geographic expansion to keep Abraxane from petering out.
"
687,MS,"Sales of Otezla, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in March 2014, totaled $90 million in Q2, up 49% from Q1.
"
688,MS,"Total revenue in the quarter rose 22% to $2.28 billion. Analysts expect full-year revenue to rise 21% to $9.3 billion. Earnings are seen growing 29% to $4.78 per share and rising another 24% in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
689,MS,"But there's a lot more to come from other drugs percolating in the wings. In Celgene's Q2 report in late July, CEO Bob Hugin said that new transactions with AstraZeneca (AZN), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Receptos (RCPT) would likely speed up earnings growth, starting in 2019.
"
690,MS,"The biggest deal, announced mid-July and valued at $7.2 billion, is Celgene's pending acquisition of Receptos, a biotech firm whose lead drug, Ozanimod, has shown good results in treating ulcerative colitis and relapsing multiple sclerosis.
"
691,MS,"Biggest Biotech Mergers
"
692,MS,"If a higher bid doesn't thwart the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter, it would be one of the largest mergers and acquisitions in the biotech/drug industry this year, after AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Alexion 's (ALXN) $8.4 billion agreement to merge with Synageva BioPharma (GEVA).
"
693,MS,"Celgene's offer for Receptos, amounting to $232 per share, expires August 24.
"
694,MS,"Receptos' oral pill Ozanimod could generate around $2 billion in annual revenue for ulcerative colitis alone, plus another $1 billion for MS, Yee says. He puts peak sales in total at $5 billion.
"
695,MS,"Phase three data for MS is expected in 2017 and for ulcerative colitis in 2018.
"
696,MS,"Another oral drug, which Celgene acquired last year in a $710 million licensing deal with Dublin, Ireland-based Nogra Pharma, could generate $1 billion as well, Yee says. Known as GED-0301, it treats Crohn's disease. Phase three trials are expected to start in Q3, later than initially planned.
"
697,MS,"""They have a very robust pipeline of partnerships and new growth drivers, with multiple billion-dollar opportunities over the next five years,"" Yee said.
"
698,MS,"Earlier this summer, Celgene announced a 10-year collaboration with Juno to develop and commercialize immunotherapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases.
"
699,MS,"Celgene will pay $150 million upfront and buy 9.1 million shares of Juno's stock, at $93 per share. It also has the right to take up to a 30% stake in Juno.
"
700,MS,"But it's not all full speed ahead. One ""overhang"" on Celgene's stock, notes Flynn, remains the potentially negative impact of a patent dispute that could shave off some of the years when Revlimid is patent-protected.
"
701,MS,"Celgene is in litigation with Allergan (AGN) over some Revlimid patents that extend through 2019 and 2026. A key challenge is on a patent that now expires in 2026. Pretrial hearings are underway.

803,MS,"Economics: Barack Obama told voters before 2014's midterm elections that, while he couldn't be on the ballot, they could still vote for his policies. Guess what? In 2016, Obama's policies will be on the ballot again.Obama's policies in 2014 suffered a historic trouncing by voters. But they haven't disappeared. Far from it. The agenda that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, unveiled on Monday contains almost the entire arsenal of Obama legislative and regulatory policies.She strongly endorsed ObamaCare and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, while calling for more taxes on businesses, more government spending, more regulations on employers, more union-friendly policies and a higher minimum wage. She calls it ""fair growth.""Why this latest Hillary Clinton reinvention? It's the Bernie Sanders effect. The Vermont senator, an avowed socialist, who was first viewed by many as a laughable addition to the race — has gained ground on Hillary by calling for 70% or more tax rates, slamming Wall Street, and expanding the entitlement state.What's sad is that the more centrist positions that defined Bill Clinton's ""New Democrat"" model have vanished from the public square. New Democrats in the 1990s ran on welfare reform, free trade, fiscal responsibility, and ""reinventing government."" But here, Hillary isn't espousing reinventing government — but reinventing herself and her belief structure.Obama beat Hillary in 2008 by moving to the left of her. To prevent that in 2016, she's now tacked so far to the left, the good ship Queen Hillary could capsize.Hillary 3.0 shouldn't be confused as a government reform agenda — but a government expansion manifesto.Her call for more child care and public infrastructure spending (paid for with more debt), more government-imposed mandated benefits on employers, more federal regulations to make it easier for the big labor bosses to unionize plants, minimum-wage hikes, more taxes on hedge funds and U.S. corporations with foreign earnings, and more green energy subsidies broadens the size and scope of Washington at every turn.Anything here sound new?Even Hillary herself half-joked that this agenda isn't new, but ""time-tested and battle-scarred."" It sure is. And what all this means in practical terms is that Hillary is now running for Barack Obama's third term.But Americans want a new direction on the half-paced 2% growth economy — not full speed ahead with Obamanomics. Ms. Clinton promises this program will help ""everyday Americans."" By this does she mean the Americans who have been financially clobbered in this Obama recovery? Given that the median-income family has lost ground over the last six years under these policies, Hillary will have a tough case explaining why warmed-over Obamanomics will fare any better.She obediently rails against inequality while she espouses the same Obama policies that have made it worse. And almost comically, she pretends to feel the pain of ""people left behind in coal country,"" as she advances the very radical climate change agenda that has decimated coal towns across the nation.To be fair, there were some good ideas. She called for a cut in the long-term capital gains tax cut, tax credits for employers, and she touted the old Jack Kemp idea of empowerment zones.But then in her next breath she wonders why businesses aren't investing and reinvesting more in the U.S. economy for ""the long term"" — even as the tax hikes and regulatory burdens of the last six years, which she praises, have punished investment.What all this means is that the real reform agenda that Americans are demanding of Washington is only likely to come from the GOP. Republicans need to fill the policy vacuum with bold and decisive ideas, like the flat tax, aimed at faster growth and a prosperity that touches more than the top 10%.Hillary and her political cronies don't get it. Those ""everyday Americans,"" who don't earn $200,000 to give speeches to lobbyists and Wall Street power brokers, have seen what Obamanomics and progressivism have done to their family finances under the guise of ""fairness"" — and they wisely want less of it.

807,MS,"Border: Recent busts of murderous MS-13 gangsters put the lie to President Obama's sympathetic amnesty narrative of illegal immigrants as ""workers who mow our lawns, make our beds (and) clean out bedpans.""Authorities Wednesday rounded up 37 MS-13 gang members in Charlotte, N.C., on racketeering conspiracy charges, along with charges of murder, attempted murder and firearms violations. All of them are illegal aliens from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Several are round-trippers — illegals who broke in once, committed crimes, got deported and broke back into the U.S. — proving that our border is porous and unsecured.Charlotte police discovered the rat's nest of foreign gangsters after some of them started shooting up local nightclubs and bars.Reading the indictment, much of the money these immigrant hoods raise from illegal gang activity is wired back to El Salvador to arrange for even more gangsters to come across the border.The funds are wired back to Central America through remittances that Obama has made cheaper and easier for illegals to send through new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules on banks.""The alleged MS-13 gang members have committed numerous violent crimes, including armed robberies, assaults, and murders, for the benefit of the criminal enterprise,"" prosecutors said in a statement.The catalog of their alleged crimes runs 17 pages in the indictment. Several pages list suspected gang members charged with ""illegal re-entry by an aggravated felon,"" or entering the U.S. illegally after they had already been deported.It's not immediately clear if any of the suspects had been given amnesty under Obama's DACA executive order for younger illegal immigrants.But the busts come on the heels of the deferred deportation the Obama administration granted to vicious Charlotte gangster Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez.Rangel-Hernandez, 19, was placed in the removal process in March 2012, following drug charges, but was shielded from removal by the administration even though it knew of his gang membership. He is now charged with the murders of four Charlotte residents, including former ""America's Next Top Model"" contestant Mirjana Puhar.Meanwhile, authorities busted a reputed MS-13 gang member wanted for execution-style murders in New York. Police in Atlanta on Tuesday arrested 22-year-old Arnolvin Umanzor Velasquez, charging him and two co-defendants — Edwin Acosta-Martinez and Sergio Cerna — with three murders, four attempted murders and multiple racketeering offenses.All three suspects were members of MS-13.These same illegal immigrant thugs are terrorizing Los Angeles, Chicago and even the nation's capital. Hundreds have been arrested in Los Angeles within the last two years. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles and has spread to states across the country.There are more than 6,000 already in the U.S. illegally, and dozens more are coming across the border daily. And though they routinely commit crimes, immigration officers don't kick them out of the country. That's because our president has told ICE to stand down.Arrests of immigrant gang members under Obama peaked in 2012, then dropped by more than 25% in 2013 and continued to decline in 2014, according to arrest records released by ICE in response to a Center for Immigration Studies FOIA request.Clearly, even violent gang members are not a high priority for enforcement. These are the beneficiaries of Obama's executive amnesty program.Obama makes it seem as if all illegals in the U.S. are hard-working and honest laborers seeking a better life, when in fact many of them are murderous thugs who are building a criminal network spanning both coasts.His rationale for granting them amnesty is a terrible falsehood and a threat to homeland security.

835,MS,"President Donald Trump doubled down on calling members of a notorious street gang — MS-13 — ""animals."" Good for him for not backing down and for shining a light on an outrageous phenomenon, especially in Southern California: Latino gangs that target blacks, whether or not they belong to gangs, for death.Trump, during a roundtable discussion last week with state and local officials from California about so-called sanctuary laws, said: ""Deadly and unconstitutional sanctuary state laws ... (offer) safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on earth, like MS-13 gang members, putting innocent men, women and children at the mercy of these sadistic criminals.""Margaret Mims, the sheriff of Northern California's Fresno County, talked about the problems caused by the state's so-called sanctuary laws, and that such laws made it harder ""to find the bad guys."" Mims said, ""There could be an MS-13 gang member I know about: If they don't reach a certain threshold (under California's sanctuary laws) I cannot tell ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) about it.""That's when Trump dropped the ""A-word.""In response to Sheriff Mims' comments, Trump said: ""We have people coming into the country — or trying to come in; we're stopping a lot of them. But we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals. And we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before.""Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., immediately pounced. The Senate minority leader tweeted: ""When all of our great-great-grandparents came to America they weren't 'animals,' and these people aren't either.""But even NBC's Chuck Todd admitted that his media colleagues widely misrepresented the President's remarks, especially the initial media reports that failed to note that Trump was referring to MS-13.""This is where I think that my colleagues do us all harm,"" Todd said. ""You know, cover this legitimately. There is plenty of legitimate stuff to ding him on, if you think he deserves to be dinged on. Just be careful. Don't be sloppy about it.""As for the ""A-word,"" Todd said: ""A lot of people have called violent anybody animals. Anybody who is a violent criminal, in my book, can get called an animal if they're sitting there mauling, killing and raping people. I don't care where they're from.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCue the selective outrage. Where was this concern for civility when Hillary ""deplorables"" Clinton said the NRA reminded her of the ""Iranians"" and the ""communists""? Recall, too, Clinton's own ""animals""-type description of some black criminals. In 1996, Clinton said: ""We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels. They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators.""Calling the MS-13 gang members ""animals"" is positively mild compared with what the liberal Southern Poverty Law Center said about other vicious Latino gangs. In 2007, the SPLC published a report called: ""Latino Gang Members in Southern California Are Terrorizing and Killing Blacks.""Some highlights:""While the vast majority of hate crimes nationwide are not committed by members of organized groups, Los Angeles County is a different story. Researchers found that in areas with high concentrations, or 'clusters,' of hate crimes, the perpetrators were typically members of Latino street gangs who were purposely targeting blacks. ...""Mexican Mafia leaders, or shot callers ... have issued a ""green light"" on all blacks. A sort of gang-life fatwah, this amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia. ...""Anti-black violence conducted by Latino gangs in Los Angeles has been ongoing for more than a decade. A 1995 Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) report about Latino gang activity in the Normandale Park neighborhood declared, 'This gang has been involved in an ongoing program to eradicate black citizens from the gang neighborhood.' A 1996 LAPD report on gangs in east Los Angeles stated, 'Local gangs will attack any black person that comes into the city.' ...""The LAPD estimates there are now 22,000 Latino gang members in the city of Los Angeles alone. That's not only more than all the Crips and the Bloods; it's more than all black, Asian, and white gang members combined. Almost all of those Latino gang members in L.A. — let alone those in other California cities — are loyal to the Mexican Mafia. Most have been thoroughly indoctrinated with the Mexican Mafia's violent racism during stints in prison, where most gangs are racially based. ...""'It's almost anywhere in L.A. that you could find yourself in a difficult position (as a black person),' says (a) LAPD probation officer. 'All blacks are on green light no matter where.'""Trump, in calling brutal gang members ""animals,"" did not go far enough.Other columns by Larry Elder

836,MS,"Celgene (CELG) plunged more than 7% Monday on a report from Morgan Stanley suggesting its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod could be delayed by up to three years.But shares recovered a little as other analysts disagreed, saying the issue identified by Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison is largely a nonissue. Celgene stock lost 4.5%, at the closing bell, ending the day at 87.10. Shares rose a fraction after hours.During a recent presentation at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, Celgene noted there were some discrepancies between converting the amounts of specific substance used in preclinical studies of ozanimod in rats and monkeys to human-size doses.Harrison suggested that could be the reason the Food and Drug Administration refused to file Celgene's application for ozanimod. He further suggested it could mean a one- to three-year delay for Celgene to re-file.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Given the timeline to start the study, produce the study reports and re-file, we believe the delay is at a minimum one year and up to three years if management must redo all animal work,"" he said in a note.Celgene got ozanimod in its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos in 2015. Receptos did early studies of ozanimod in rodents for six months and in primates for nine months.Part of those studies tested the effect of a metabolite in ozanimod known as CC112273. A metabolite is a substance formed in, or necessary for, metabolism. For animal studies to be acceptable, the tests must closely mirror the impact a drug would have in humans.It appears ""exposure of CC112273 in animal models was likely below a relevant human therapeutic dose,"" Harrison said. This wasn't a problem for other metabolites. Notably, researchers discovered the issue with CC112273 in a later human study, he added.The FDA refused to file Celgene's application for ozanimod in February. Celgene cited issues in the ""non-clinical and clinical pharmacology sections"" of the application. It didn't go further into the specific problems.Celgene shares plummeted to a four-year low on that news. Also early this month, Scott Smith, a key executive who helped build up Celgene's inflammation and immunology business, unexpectedly left the company. Chief Executive Mark Alles took up his primary duties.Harrison kept his 93 price target and equal-weight rating on Celgene.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed argued if the FDA's decision on ozanimod is related to the CC112273 metabolite, it's really a nonissue. More than 4,000 human patients have taken ozanimod over two years.""If there was a deleterious effect on (effectiveness), safety or (toxicology), it would have shown up,"" he said in a report. ""Going back to introduce massively higher levels of the metabolite than animals create on their own, when we already know this does not impair safety or (effectiveness) in humans is irrelevant.""He added, ""It's creating a condition that does not exist.""Syed also performed a survey of 56 investors. Of those, 37% believe Celgene will refile with the FDA for approval in the first half of 2019. Slightly less, 36%, expect the firm to refile in the second half of 2018.RBC analyst Brian Williams believes Celgene has already begun additional preclinical work on ozanimod. Researchers discovered the CC112273 metabolite about a year ago. So even if Celgene needs to perform two years of additional study, it's already halfway through.Williams and Evercore analyst Umer Raffat also noted in separate reports that Celgene publicly brought attention to the issue in an email to analysts.""Celgene proactively drawing attention to this issue could be a signal of confidence into Friday's earnings call (and an) ozanimod filing update,"" Williams said in a note.Evercore's Raffat expects Celgene to wrap up additional studies on ozanimod as a multiple sclerosis drug in the summer. Then, it will likely re-file for approval in the late summer or early fall, he said in a note to clients.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Next Nvidia?

837,MS,"Wall Street's top stock traders got some help from their bond brethren.Morgan Stanley (MS) posted a surprise jump in fixed-income trading, which combined with better-than-expected equities results helped push revenue above $11 billion for the first time ever. First-quarter profit, boosted by corporate tax cuts, also rose to an all-time high.Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has overseen a recovery in his firm's bond-trading business even as the industry suffered in recent years from calm markets that cut demand for fixed-income services. Now, rising rates and political uncertainties offer a chance for the unit, led by Sam Kellie-Smith, to boost revenue and catch up to its stock-trading business, which is the world's biggest.Shares of the company, which gained 1.5% this year through Tuesday, advanced 1.9% to $54.25 in early New York trading at 7:10 a.m.Morgan Stanley used electronic systems to grab the stock-trading business of quantitative hedge funds that have increased assets in recent years. Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher said he wants to do the same for bonds.Investment-banking revenue climbed 7% to $1.51 billion, better than the 1.4% slump that analysts expected, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based bank was the No. 1 adviser so far this year on mergers and acquisitions, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

838,MS,"Celgene (CELG) ""nailed it"" in the first quarter after delivering a broad beat-and-raise Friday, analysts said, but they questioned the timeline for the release of its key multiple sclerosis drug.Analysts were split on whether the first-quarter beat was enough to outweigh concerns about the MS drug, dubbed ozanimod. The Food and Drug Administration punted Celgene's application for ozanimod in February. Now, Celgene expects to refile for approval in early 2019.The ""modest beat fails to offset more development setbacks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. But RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says the update on ozanimod is in line with expectations and ""should help diminish near-term uncertainty.""Investors rewarded Celgene, but it was short-lived. On the stock market today, Celgene rose as much as 4.1% before settling to a 1.7% gain at 86.89 by the close. Meanwhile, biotech stocks collectively lifted 1.3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the first quarter, Celgene reported $3.54 billion in sales, rising 19% to top the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.5 billion. Adjusted profit of $2.05 a share beat the consensus for $2 and grew nearly 23%.Revenue from cancer drugs outperformed expectations. Revlimid brought in $2.23 billion, in line with the consensus and up 19%, Porges said. Pomalyst raked in $453 million, growing 24.5% to beat views by 3%. Abraxane generated $262 million, up 11% and topping by 6%.In immunology, sales of psoriasis and arthritis drug Otezla grew 46% to $353 million. That was 2% above the consensus, Porges said, but down 5% sequentially. In the U.S., increased demand and improved access helped spike sales, Celgene said in a news release.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said Celgene ""nailed it"" for an ""awesome quarter.""""All products came in line or beat slightly,"" he said in a note. ""Total product revenues beat by $100 million and the company slightly raised the 2018 guide on the top and bottom line.""Celgene also boosted its sales guidance for 2018 to $14.8 billion, up from earlier views for $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. The firm also sees earnings of $8.45 a share, adjusted for the recent acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Analysts had predicted $14.84 billion in sales and earnings of $8.44 a share.The big news, though, regarded ozanimod. In February, the FDA refused to file the application for ozanimod. Celgene cited deficiencies in the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections of the application for the FDA's decision.Earlier in the week, an analyst suggested that the issue came down to a specific substance within the drug, known as a metabolite. A metabolite is a substance formed in, or necessary for, metabolism. Celgene discovered this specific metabolite in later-stage testing in humans.RBC's Abrahams noted that this specific metabolite, known as CC112273, seems to stay in the body much longer than researchers initially realized. It's also responsible for about 90% of the drug's activity, he said in a report to clients.""However, the longer half-life should not be a major issue once the metabolite is characterized,"" he said. ""Other drugs in the class, like Gilenya, also have half-lives in similar ranges.""Now, Celgene expects to refile its application for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis in the first quarter of 2019. This timeline ""takes the uber bear case of a two-plus-year delay off the table,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note.But it also means that Celgene's ozanimod, if approved, will be entering the market at about the same time as generic versions of Novartis' (NVS) rival drug Gilenya, Leerink's Porges said.""The new timeline is three quarters behind what we have forecast and may put the commercial launch in some uncertainty given the expected entry of generic Gilenya,"" he said. But he kept his outperform rating on Celgene stock.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

839,MS,"Jon Ayers knew Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) had rich potential as soon as he came on board the pet health care company.X""When I got here I felt there was a gold mine of opportunity,"" Ayers, who joined Idexx as chairman, president and CEO in January 2002, told IBD.Ayers also knew he needed to change Idexx's existing corporate mindset to tap into that opportunity.""Before I came here, the consensus was the growth in pet health care diagnostics had seen its day and was over,"" Ayers said. ""I thought that was completely wrong. In fact, I thought there was an enormous opportunity to bring new innovation and growth to that business which was growing at 3% to 4%"" a year, he said.So Ayers, a veteran business leader, combined his love of animals and interest in biology with his strong management skills to develop a strategy that would change that mentality and prove the naysayers wrong. At the core of this strategy is a focus on investing in constant innovation to provide veterinarians with cutting-edge diagnostic and information management tools that enhance the health and well-being of pets.Guided by this approach, Ayers and his team have transformed Idexx into a leader in pet health care innovation. And it's also led to the introduction of groundbreaking and lifesaving diagnostic products.Ayers' strategy at the outset was aimed at moving Idexx into growth mode.""When I came in 2002, I saw quotes that the company's growth in its diagnostics business could be three to four times what it was,"" Ayers said. ""Now the business is growing at double-digit rates and is five times larger. And we're still in the same business. What changed was this mentality that you couldn't grow the business,"" he said.Idexx's strategy, business and organization have been completely transformed under Ayers' leadership.In the process, Ayers and his team have propelled impressive financial growth and gained the attention of investors. Idexx revenue grew to $1.969 billion in 2017 from $400 million when Ayers took the helm in 2002. Over the last 16 years, revenue has grown at an average annual compound rate of 10.7%. Idexx's market cap has rocketed from around $1 billion in 2002 to roughly $18 billion today. Since Ayers became CEO in 2002 through the present, its stock price has surged at a compound annual rate of 23%, at a time when the S&P 500 grew at 5.3%, the company says. Idexx joined the S&P 500 in January 2017.""We feel like we're just getting started, even though we're growing aggressively,"" Ayers said. ""We are five times bigger than we were 16 years ago. And it's not through acquisitions. We're growing at a rate that is faster than it has been for the last 10 years. We've seen the company's acceleration in growth coming from the focus on innovation in pet health care.""Idexx's diagnostic and IT-based products and services for the veterinary market are part of its Companion Animal Group (CAG). It represents 87% of the company's business. Idexx's innovations in animal health care diagnostics includes tests to detect Lyme disease, heartworm and intestinal parasites; and most recently, a test that finds kidney disease early enough to treat it.Ayers' focus on innovation is one of his core principles and key to his management philosophy.""We bring innovation to new markets around our core focus of animal health care, specifically diagnostics,"" Ayers said. ""My philosophy is to focus on doing a few things really well and continue to improve. We focus on innovation that creates growth. There's enormous opportunity in animal health care. We're bringing a tremendous amount of innovation that provides insights into the status of the pet's health.""Idexx's position in pet animal health care has soared.""They are easily the dominant leader in animal health diagnostics globally,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro told IBD.He estimates Idexx has over 50% of the in-clinic animal health diagnostics market in the U.S.Massaro attributes the company's success to Ayers' strong leadership supported by his best-in-class management team.""Jon Ayers has a unique passion for animal health that is unrivaled in the entire industry,"" Massaro said. ""He is easily the most successful evangelist for animal health I've ever seen. He is an outstanding ambassador for a higher standard of care to test cats and dogs all over the world. His focus has never been limited to the U.S. Nearly 40% of its revenue is outside of North America.""Ayers' love for animals and inspiration for enhancing their health starts with his two cats, who have a variety of long-term medical conditions that have benefited from Idexx's diagnostics.""I don't think they'd be alive today if it hadn't been for Idexx,"" Ayers said. ""I like to understand the business through the eyes of a pet owner. We sell to veterinarians. But pet owners are ultimately behind the demand. If you're a pet owner, you really have a strong appreciation for the value we're bringing to the market.""Another one of Ayers' core principles is focus.""I like to say: Ten things half done equals nothing done,"" Ayers said. ""If you focus on doing a few things well, it will achieve better results. A lot of CEOs think they have to grow through acquisition. We grow organically at Idexx. We don't want to do anything that's outside of our core businesses and get distracted. Innovation is a team sport, and it starts with the CEO. Everyone is part of the team.""Ayers came to Idexx rich with leadership and business experience. He held various leadership posts at United Technologies (UTX) and its business unit Carrier Corp. He served as president of Carrier from 1999 to 2001. He was vice president of strategic planning at United Technologies from 1995 to 1997. From 1986 to 1995, Ayers held various positions at Morgan Stanley (MS) in M&A and corporate finance.William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels gives Ayers, 62, high marks for his leadership.""I covered Idexx for more than a decade and have traveled with Jon,"" Daniels said. ""I always said he is in the upper-echelon of the executives I have worked with in my career. He has surrounded himself with a great group of executive leaders. I am always tremendously impressed with the strong executive team and how collaborative Jon is in working with them on key strategic decisions.""Daniels says one example of that collaboration was when Idexx decided to go from a hybrid sales distribution model where it used a variety of distributors to sell the CAG group's products in the U.S. to an all-direct product distribution model.""It was a very controversial move,"" Daniels said. ""They had a leadership position and had a lot of exclusivity with a lot of distributors.""Ayers was fully aware the move was controversial. But going direct fit in with his growth strategy.""When we made the move in 2015 there were a lot of people who were skeptical about that shift, and many people said we made a big mistake,"" Ayers said. ""We had every confidence that by getting closer to our customers we would be better able to help our customers adopt our products, and services behind our innovation, at a faster rate.""And so it has.""We had developed a lot of new products and services,"" Ayers said. ""But the vet needs to understand the medicine behind it. By moving fully direct we could spend more time with customers, form deeper relationships.""Since it went direct, Ayers says the company has seen its growth rate accelerate. Ayers says that in the first quarter of 2018 recurring (CAG) diagnostics revenue accelerated to 13% growth organically.""That was a consequence not only of having innovation, but bringing our customers closer with our direct sales force,"" he said.Ayers' advice to MBA graduates? ""Take every job you have as a learning opportunity toward the goal that you seek. Work on self-development through your experiences through your entire life. No one else will do it for you. So take responsibility and seek those learning experiences.""That's what Ayers has done throughout his career.""I learned so much in every one of my jobs,"" Ayers said. ""I've been at Idexx for 16 years, and I'm still learning.""Transformed Idexx into a leader in pet health care innovation.Overcame: Slow-growth mindset in animal health care industry.Lessons: ""Take every job you have as a learning opportunity toward the goal that you seek.""

841,MS,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and shot down the capital plan of a Deutsche Bank (DB) U.S. subsidiary in its second round of stress tests. But the central bank largely cleared the big banks to deliver payouts to shareholders. Bank stocks largely rose for much of the day, but closed mixed as the major market indexes slashed gains.The Fed, in ""conditionally"" passing Morgan and Goldman in the tests, said the banks would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years, which will allow them to build capital over the next year.""The central bank said those banks' capital ratios, under the plans they originally submitted and with a one-time reduction resulting from tax reform, fell below the Fed's required levels in the test.The second round of the tests — the one Wall Street cares more about — evaluates banks' dividend and buyback plans, and the strength of their risk management practices and other internal controls. Many of the banks that passed the second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, dialed up their shareholder returns.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement.All the banks tested passed the first round of the tests last week, although Morgan and Goldman came close to falling short on a key leverage ratio. Still, passing the annual industry health checkup, implemented after the financial crisis a decade ago, has become easier for the big banks, even as the Fed each year tries to add harsher, or at least different, ingredients to the mix.But even amid a surging economy and loosening regulations, bank stocks have wilted over the last few months on concerns over the economy longer-term.After the Fed expressed reservations, Morgan Stanley said it would boost its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share, up from 25 cents, and buy back up to $4.7 billion in common stock. Morgan Stanley stock rose Friday but remained near six-month lows.Goldman said that its capital plan included a boost in its dividend to 85 cents per share, up from 80 cents. The bank also said its capital plan allowed up to $5 billion in stock buybacks. Goldman rose modestly and was near nine-month lows.Goldman said the Fed did not object to its capital plan, ""conditioned upon the firm returning not more than $6.3 billion of capital beginning in the third quarter of 2018 and ending in the second quarter of 2019.""The Fed said it objected to the capital plan from the Deutsche Bank subsidiary, DB USA Corp., citing ""material weaknesses in the firm's data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress.""The Fed also gave State Street Corp. (STT) a conditional pass. The central bank said its evaluation revealed ""counterparty exposures that produced large losses.""""The firm will be required to take certain steps regarding the management and analysis of its counterparty exposures under stress,"" the Fed added.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it intends to raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 80 cents a share, up from 56 cents a share, effective in Q3. The bank also OK'd share buybacks of up to $20.7 billion between July 1 and June 30, 2019.Citigroup (C), meanwhile, announced an increase in its dividend to 45 cents a share, up from 32 cents. It also announced a buyback program of up to $17.6 billion during the four quarters starting in the third quarter.Bank of America (BAC) said its board plans to raise its dividend by 25% to 15 cents a share, starting in Q3. BofA said it had also been cleared to buy back roughly $20.6 billion in common stock.JPMorgan Chase bumped retreated 0.7% in the stock market today, reversing from solid gains intraday. Bank of America retreated 1.6%. Citigroup picked up 0.1%. Goldman Sachs lost 1.3% while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.8%.In the first round of bank stress tests, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley nearly missed clearing the minimum for what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio. The ratio measures how much capital a bank needs in relation to its assets.Morgan Stanley, in a statement last week, said those results ""may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make"" after the release of the second round of results. Goldman said essentially the same thing, with a statement that it expected to discuss the first-round test results with the Fed.Banks can resubmit their payout plans if the Fed's results are too pessimistic for a bank's liking.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement last Thursday.Under the bleakest economic scenario, the Fed last week concluded that the 35 banks subject to the tests would lose $578 billion total. The so-called ""severely adverse"" scenario, the harshest one laid out by the Fed each year, included a global recession and a six percentage-point rise in unemployment to 10%.The source of bank stocks' woes has been the tightening Treasury yield curve. The curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, has narrowed sharply over the past several months to the flattest in years. The spread has narrowed further in the last few weeks.Rates on longer end of the curve tend to rise when expectations for the economy are brighter. The idea is that when the economy grows, prices rise, so investors demand a higher return on government debt to make up for the declining purchasing power of the dollar over that time. Borrowers are willing to pay up, because they expect a higher rate of return.But longer-term rates have waned. Meanwhile, the short end of the curve has risen, thanks to the Fed's recent hikes on overnight rates. That sluggish long-term yield reflects concerns that the Fed will raise rates too aggressively as the Trump tax cuts and fiscal stimulus boost economic growth in 2018 but then wear offBanks tend to borrow money according to short-term rates, while lending out money according to longer-term rates.

844,MS,"Deutsche Bank (DB) is reportedly planning to shed 10,000 jobs amid a cost-cutting drive and a broad retreat from key markets.XAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the struggling German financial giant had considered slashing 5,000 jobs earlier this year but worried it would not have much impact on investors.But the 10,000 cuts now being planned would represent about one in 10 workers and accelerate cost-cutting measures.The cuts also come as the bank plans to withdraw from a number of equities markets across the globe. Sources told Bloomberg earlier this month that the bank will sharply cut back its presence in the U.S. and has started cutting activities in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The bank is also under pressure from credit ratings agencies, with Standard & Poor's expected to say whether it will cut the lender's rating by the end of the month.

847,MS,"Regulators are reportedly planning to make changes to the so-called Volcker Rule that could make it easier for banks to handle short-term trading.The potential rollback, reported by Bloomberg, arrives as the House could soon pass legislation exempting smaller banks from the Volcker Rule entirely. The bill already cleared the Senate.The proposed short-term trading rollback follows complaints from banks and the Trump administration that the rule, intended to curb risky trading by banks in the wake of the financial crisis, is too complex. Limiting banks' short-term trading could reduce liquidity, exacerbating problems in a future financial crisis.Currently, the Volcker Rule bars banks from doing short-term proprietary trading with their own accounts and restricts other speculative moves. But the proposal from regulators would do away with a part of Volcker that assumes trading positions held by the banks for less than 60 days as speculative and thus not allowed, Bloomberg said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe proposed change would let banks assume those trades are OK, placing the burden on regulators to prove they aren't, Bloomberg said.The proposal, among others, could be released by the end of the month. Agencies will then vote on whether to hold public comment. The Volcker Rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, is part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.The Treasury Department last year argued that the Volcker Rule's take on short-term trades was too subjective and ""effectively requires an inquiry into the trader's intent.""""Recognizing the difficulty of discerning the purpose of a transaction, the regulations create a rebuttable presumption that any position held for fewer than 60 days constitutes proprietary trading,"" that report said.The report added that the measure ""places the burden on firms to justify the permissibility of their trading, creating undue pressure on compliance programs and leading to excessive conservatism in firms' trading activities.""""In addition, policymakers should assess whether the purpose test should be eliminated altogether, to avoid requiring banks to dissect the intent of a trade,"" the report said.Banks stocks were not that active Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.09%, its highest since 2011. Higher long-term yields can be good news for banks.

849,MS,"Citigroup (C) rallied Tuesday after semi-activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners reportedly amassed a $1.2 billion stake, saying the banking giant could return more capital to shareholders and roughly double its earnings per share by 2020.But an analyst played down the move, citing ValueAct's ""relatively passive"" involvement in other financial companies that it partially owns. The analyst also indicated that ValueAct's EPS target for Citigroup could be tough to reach. However, he said ValueAct could press Citi to make an acquisition.In a letter to investors seen by the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, ValueAct isn't demanding major changes at Citigroup.

851,MS,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues. Patients must be monitored after their first dose.""The attribute neurologists care most about in a next-generation S1P therapy is the absence of first-dose monitoring,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said. ""They also rank an advantage on liver enzyme impact pretty far down the list of comparative advantages they're looking for in an S1P vs. Gilenya.""It's not clear whether ozanimod will have a similar requirement. But Celgene management indicates ""the going assumption is that ozanimod won't avoid it,"" Raymond said in his note to clients.""As we see it, unless ozanimod can avoid first-dose monitoring, Celgene faces an uphill battle in its efforts to differentiate the molecule,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

852,MS,"Having launched tariff battles against China and other ""unfair traders,"" the Trump administration is now trying to revive trade subsidies for them. Both moves will damage the U.S. economy, unless Congress intervenes.The trade subsidies at issue are financial instruments that the U.S. Export-Import Bank provides to a select group of foreign companies and governments to subsidize their purchases of U.S. exports. China, Mexico and Canada ranked among the biggest beneficiaries in previous years.During the past three years, however, the bank has lacked a president and a board quorum — and therefore been barred from issuing export loans and credit guarantees in excess of $10 million. That has meant less taxpayer-backed financing for a cadre of multinational corporations and foreign governments that otherwise constitute Ex-Im's biggest beneficiaries.President Trump evidently is now convinced that the bank should return to full operation. He recently added a former Treasury official to a slate of board nominees that, if confirmed by the Senate, would restore Ex-Im's quorum. The bank would then be able to resume doling out multimillion dollar subsidies to foreign competitors of U.S. businesses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina routinely ranks among the top beneficiaries of Ex-Im's largesse. For example, government-controlled Air China received more than $1.8 billion in Ex-Im assistance between 2007 and 2013, and some $4.5 billion in export loans and credit insurance from Ex-Im to Chinese firms remains outstanding.Pemex, Mexico's national petroleum company, received $7.3 billion in Ex-Im assistance in the same period. And there remains $6.5 billion in ongoing assistance among various Mexican companies.This American generosity is clearly at odds with the president's repeated assertions that China, Mexico and Canada are taking advantage of the United States, and his insistence on renegotiating NAFTA and the recent imposition of tariffs.To be fair, the president may think that tariffs and export subsidies don't conflict — that one serves to block imports while the other props up (select) domestic exports. The reality, however, is quite different.Taken together, these policies punish American consumers of foreign goods — many of whom are U.S. manufacturers who may have to lay off workers — while rewarding Chinese consumers and manufacturers. Call it the ""Make Other Countries Great Again"" policy.And then there is the issue of Trump's board nominee, Kimberly Reed.She has lamented the hamstringing of Ex-Im, characterizing it as ""unilateral disarmament"" in the world of export subsidies. However, the ""disarmament"" argument presumes that such subsidies are necessary to compete.In fact, there is no shortage of private export financing.Indeed, the vast majority of U.S. exports — 98% — do not receive assistance from the bank. Nonetheless, U.S. exports exceeded $2.35 billion in 2017 — the second largest volume in nearly a half century.Ex-Im is cronyism incarnate. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 65% of the bank's subsidies benefited just 10 U.S. corporations. Yet those companies — Boeing, General Electric, Bechtel among them — hardly lack access to capital. Many of these companies are themselves sources of financing for global products.The bank's foremost beneficiary has long been Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, with a market cap of nearly $207 billion. Despite the absence of major Ex-Im Bank financing for its foreign customers, Boeing still managed (somehow!) to generate $93.4 billion in revenue last year on a record 763 commercial deliveries. The company's backlog remains robust at $488 billion, including a record 5,864 commercial aircraft.At the same time, Boeing's own financing arm — the Boeing Capital Corporation — holds a gross customer finance and investment portfolio of more than $3 billion. According to the company's 2017 annual report, ""(W)e expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.""The benefits provided by the bank impose costs on the rest of America. Foreign recipients of the bank's subsidies gain an artificial competitive advantage over domestic firms that go without the discount financing. Taxpayers, for their part, are on the hook for bank losses not covered by its reserves.Ex-Im revivalists warn that foreign export-credit agencies (China's, in particular) will overtake America's bounty of entrepreneurial advantages. They incessantly refer to the need for ""a level playing field."" But there is no such thing. As the principle of comparative advantage holds, every country possesses advantages that others lack. The notion that the U.S. Ex-Im will balance the playing field of global trade is absurd.Finance costs are only one among a variety of factors that affect a purchaser's choice of supplier. Availability, reliability and stability all play significant parts in purchase decisions. It's preposterous to worry that U.S. firms are incapable of competing successfully without corporate welfare.In addition to Ms. Reed's confirmation, the bank still needs two new board members to create a quorum — without which the bank will remain barred from approving any transaction over $10 million. Congress reauthorized the bank's charter through September 30, 2019, and it continues to process financing for smaller deals.There is no justification for the Senate to return Ex-Im to full operation. Export subsidies yield more harm than benefit to consumers and the companies that employ them.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business DailyWant to make more money in the stock market?

On Thursday, Amazon (AMZN) agreed to buy PillPack, making a decisive, long-rumored move into the pharmacy space.Walgreens, which reportedly sought the online pharmacy for itself, tumbled on the news, along with other drug stores and other pharmacy-related stocks.Walgreens stock peaked in January, then sank after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) struck a healthcare partnership. The move potentially threatens Walgreens, which also manages prescription-drug plans and provides health care to store customers.But the pharmacy chain now counts on roughly 10,000 stores — after acquiring thousands of Rite-Aid (RAD) locations — to return to earnings growth.Shares of Walgreens dived 17.4% in the first six months of 2018.Industrial conglomerate 3M must reckon with a continued shift away from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, analysts say.That macroeconomic trend coincided with a severe downturn in its key power market.

Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data.

The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles.

Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS.

Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents.

859,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) were among all 35 banks that passed the Federal Reserve's stress test, clearing a major hurdle toward huge hikes in capital returns.The Federal Reserve said the nation's largest banks are strongly capitalized, though Goldman Sachs (GS) came the closest to missing the mark, posting a leverage ratio of 3.1% vs. the Fed's minimum requirement of 3%.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a press release.The Dodd-Frank stress test results detail whether banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. This is the first of two tests. On June 28, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.Some analysts see a majority of banks making payouts that exceed profits for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo among them.""I don't think generally today's results, that everyone passed, are a big surprise to anybody. It was largely expected,"" Raymond James managing director Michael Rose said.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stress test actually being stricter this year.Under 2018's stress test scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak. This is tougher than the 6.5% drop that was modeled last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's stress test outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Banks will be able to unveil their capital return plans for the coming year following the release of the second set of results next Thursday. Those tests determine how large a capital buffer that banks need to protect themselves from a financial crisis.But Wells Fargo is at an elevated risk to fail the June 28 test due to oversight issues related to its account-opening scandal and perhaps a lack of focus by management on the exam due to the scandal, Rose said.""Even if everybody passes quantitatively, (Fed regulators have) historically made an example out of one or more banks on the qualitative side,"" he told IBD. ""I wouldn't expect them to deviate from that historical pattern when we get next week's CCAR results.""Shares of JPMorgan closed essentially unchanged on the stock market today. Bank of America rose 0.2% and Wells Fargo dipped 0.2%, while Citigroup gained 0.4%. Goldman Sachs fell 0.4% and Morgan Stanley (MS) slid 0.2%.After the close, Wells Fargo edged up, while the others fell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Not everyone is quite so bullish, however. The likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James see the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks. This is around a quarter more than in 2017.""We look for the median bank's total payout ratio to approach 100%, while both dividends and share repurchase increase over 20% from CCAR 2017's level,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note. ""We believe the pace of dividend increases could exceed that of share repurchase.""There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.One fly in the ointment is the current flattening yield curve. This could lower profits, as banks make money on the difference between long- and short-term rates.

861,MS,"Almost three decades ago, BlackRock (BLK) created software to obsessively monitor the then-fledgling firm's financial risks. Now, after turning it into an essential tool on Wall Street, the firm is zeroing in on another kind of client: financial advisors.The world's largest asset manager is marketing its risk analytics software, known as Aladdin, to the army of wealth managers who oversee billions of dollars in client assets. The effort has gained a foothold with the wealth-management units of Morgan Stanley (MS) and UBS Group (UBS), which oversee about $5.1 trillion in client assets, using the program to screen portfolios and analyze their weak spots.The software was the star of BlackRock's biannual investor day June 5. In an art deco ballroom in midtown Manhattan, a rotating cast of top executives took the stage bathed in teal light, where they outlined plans to spread Aladdin to further reaches of finance.""There is a huge opportunity for Aladdin to be the language of portfolio construction,"" said BlackRock Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein during his presentation. ""We've only just scratched the surface here.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAladdin is the linchpin of BlackRock's fast-growing technology business. Chief Executive Larry Fink has said he hopes technology will power 30% of the firm's revenue by 2022, though he said last year that would be a ""giant reach."" Winning over brokers and investment advisors will give the firm a huge platform from which to sell mutual funds and ETFs — and expand its already vast, some say alarming, influence in finance.BlackRock has a long way to go in wealth management. While about 20% of the top 200 global asset managers use the software, it's only reached 2% of the global private wealth industry, according to the company.The creation of Aladdin — short for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network — dates back almost as far as BlackRock itself. At first, the firm used it solely as an internal tool. It's often called the firm's ""central nervous system"" because the software analyzes the $6.3 trillion investment firm's every move. It monitors all of BlackRock's portfolios, weighing what-ifs and worst-case scenarios, and even handles tasks like tracking corporate head count.Today, outside firms and competitors license the software to 30,000 users in 50 countries, according to the company. In addition to asset managers, other clients using Aladdin include the largest U.S. pension funds, CalSTRS and CalPERS, and some of the top insurers. Even competitor Vanguard Group uses Aladdin to supplement some of its in-house risk-monitoring tools, according to a Vanguard spokesperson.The asset manager first got the idea to start licensing the product in the 1990s, during the U.S. recession, according to Goldstein, a 24-year veteran of the company. Wall Street firms asked BlackRock to examine their portfolios, giving the company an idea: it could sell the technology to other industry players and competitors.""We had built an X-ray machine, and there were a lot of people who felt like something didn't feel right and they needed an X-ray,"" Goldstein said in an interview.In total, Aladdin watches over a vast sum, rivaling the U.S. gross domestic product of more than $18 trillion.BlackRock's more recent plan grew out of an internal hackathon about three years ago. Engineers paved the way for a new product, called Aladdin for Wealth, which flipped the business model. While the traditional Aladdin software examines data on millions of securities for large accounts, the wealth product helps brokers and investment advisors analyze client accounts invested in a more limited pool of securities, such as mutual funds.Andy Saperstein, co-head of Morgan Stanley's wealth-management unit, has said that using the software will help scour client portfolios for ""risks that they didn't even know they were taking.""That's an area it can mine for opportunity. If Aladdin spots gaps or undue risk in a portfolio, BlackRock can be in a good position to promote — and sell — its products, especially low-fee ETFs and index funds that clients on Main Street crave.""This is something more holistic, which is where the industry's going,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""There's more demand for that now than there was five or 10 years ago.""BlackRock has also decided for the first time to open up part of the platform to engineers within its client organizations too, in an effort to further embed the software in their day-to-day business. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, sells financial software that competes on certain fronts with Aladdin.Competitors say Aladdin is becoming its own kind of risk. One recurring criticism of the software is that it could lead to a kind of groupthink about risk. With hundreds of clients relying on it, Aladdin could gravitate toward similar conclusions or fail to recognize common blind spots, critics contend.SimCorp of Copenhagen sells risk software that competes with Aladdin. Its chief executive, Klaus Holse, said some of his clients shun Aladdin because they ""don't want to enter into the systemic risk of being with BlackRock. If that for some reason fails, then everyone fails.""Some SimCorp clients have raised concerns about BlackRock because they ""don't want to fund a competitor,"" he said.BlackRock's Goldstein said such criticism is unfounded as Aladdin isn't a one-size-fits-all risk tool. Each customer uses it in distinctive ways and rather than dictating behavior, it functions more like ""a dashboard, in terms of how people drive a car,"" he said.The software is crucial to the asset manager's future, he added. Hoping to impress that upon shareholders at investor day, Goldstein stood in front of a giant projection screen that displayed the words ""ALADDIN IS BLACKROCK.""""Aladdin and technology are core to everything we do,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Amazon, Netflix Lead Tech Stocks As Key Index Hits Record High7 Key Ways To Check If The Stock Market Is HealthyWall Street Wants To Know If The Fed Will Boost Bank Stocks

She's particularly upset at the handful of her fellow Democrats who voted for a bill that watered down the Dodd-Frank banking regulation behemoth.Warren went on to say: ""Until we have all the Democrats who are willing to take on the billionaire class, until we have all the Democrats who are willing to fight for the American people and not for a handful of billionaires and giant corporations, then it's going to stay an uphill fight.""This makes little sense.For one thing, there are only 585 of them in the U.S. today, according to Forbes. And plenty of them are big-time Democrats.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDoes she intend, for example, to take on Warren Buffett, who, with a net worth of $84 billion, is the third richest man in the world? He's a longtime Democrat who's pushed for tax hikes on the rich, backed Hillary Clinton, and who gave 99% of his money to Democrats and liberal groups in the past four election cycles.Maybe she means Michael Bloomberg, 11th richest man in the world (net worth $50 billion). He's a huge gun control supporter.What about George Soros, who's worth $8 billion? He's an uber liberal who finances a multitude of left-wing groups like Center for American Progress and Moveon.org. He recently invested $3 million in The New York Times.In 2016, Soros gave at least $7 million to Hillary Clinton's Priorities USA super-PAC. He's donated more than $61 million to Democrats and liberals since 1989, according to OpenSecrets.org.Does Warren want to ""take on"" environmental activist Tom Steyer — net worth $1.6 billion. He donated more than $91 million to Democrats in 2016 alone, and funded a $20 million ad campaign calling for President Trump's impeachment.Or perhaps she means Netflix CEO Reed Hastings (net worth $2.7 billion). Except that Hastings is another prominent Democrat who eagerly supported Clinton and just signed a deal with Barack Obama to produce programs for Netflix.Other billionaires Warren says Democrats should have the ""guts"" take on would include liberals like Google's Larry Page ($48.8 billion), Laurene Powell Jobs ($18.8 billion), Oprah Winfrey ($2.7 billion), Starbucks' Howard Schultz ($2.7 billion), Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg ($1.6 billion).Of the 36 billionaires who made campaign contributions over the past four election cycles, 40% of their money — totaling $148 million — went to Democrats, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets.org. And this doesn't include ""dark money"" donations — funds given to groups engaged in politics that don't have to disclose their donors.What about those greedy bankers? Turns out, plenty of them are Democratic supporters, too.A few years ago, Yahoo Finance teamed up with Crowdpac to rank CEOs based on political donations. One of the five most liberal on the list was Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein, whose company made news during the election when it turned out that Goldman had paid Hillary Clinton $675,000 to appear at three Q&A sessions, two of them run by Blankfein himself.In 6th and 7th place were James Gorman of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase  (JPM).Billionaire hedge fund manager Jim Simons gave more than $7 million to Hillary Clinton's Priorities USA Action super PAC. He gave $2.6 million to the Democratic House and Senate Majority PACs, according to OpenSecrets.org.Laurence Fink, CEO of the investing giant BlackRock  (BLK), is another prominent Democrat who wants companies he invests in to have a ""positive impact on society"" (i.e., support liberal causes).Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan has over the years given money to Jeanne Shaheen, Patrick Kennedy, Harold Ford Jr., Ted Kennedy, Ed Markey and John Kerry. He even gave $6,300 to then Sen. Chris Dodd — he of Dodd-Frank fame.Sure, lots of billionaires support Republicans and oppose Warren's leftist politics. So do lots of people at all income levels.But the idea that the ""billionaire class"" opposes all that is good in this country and that they must be defeated to get anything done is nothing more than sophomoric political posturing.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Look Who's Complaining About Massive ObamaCare Premium Hikes — After Ignoring Them For YearsSay, Whatever Happened To That 'Gig Economy' Everybody Predicted?How Many Dems Agree With Bill Maher's Recession Wish?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

864,MS,"Maybe you've seen the video of the hero the French have dubbed ""Spider-Man."" When he saw a toddler dangling off a fourth-story balcony, he scaled the exterior of the Paris building in about 30 seconds to save the child. Turns out Mamoudou Gassama was a newly arrived illegal immigrant from Mali. A grateful President Emmanuel Macron made him a French citizen a day later.Or consider the story of Jesus Manuel Cordova. He illegally crossed the border from Mexico into Arizona and came upon a damaged car. Inside was a dead mother and an injured 9-year-old boy. Cordova stayed with the child for hours until help arrived.So, does that mean all illegal immigrants are heroes? Obviously not, no more than the crimes of MS-13 or the murder of Kate Steinle prove that all illegal immigrants are criminals.Both parties are resorting to stereotypes and incitement. The Democrats, intent upon portraying the utter depravity of the Trump administration's approach to immigration, seized upon a story that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency had ""lost"" 1,475 illegal immigrant minors who were separated from their parents. A widely cited story alleged that federal officials could not find these kids. Several pointed to a Frontline account alleging that at least some of the kids had been released to human traffickers.But within a couple of days, the corrections flowed in. It wasn't, The New York Times and others advised, that the kids were lost. Rather, these were among the ""unaccompanied minors"" who crossed the border in 2014. They were placed with adults. The Times quoted Ephrat Livni of Quartz, who explained: ""It certainly sounds bad,"" but ""many of those missing kids may well be with their parents or families, and they may have gone off the grid deliberately to avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities."" As for the Frontline story, it referenced a government report from 2016, i.e., before the current administration could be held accountable.But here's the irony: The Trump administration's position amounts to saying, ""We weren't responsible for separating children from their parents, but going forward, we will be."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced that separating even very young children from their parents will now be policy -- as deterrence. ""If you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law,"" he said. ""If you don't like that, then don't smuggle children over our border.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWell, if deterrence of illegal immigration justifies visiting the sins (if that's what they are) of the parents upon the children, why stop there? Why not confine the children in cages, feed them only bread and water and confiscate their teddy bears? After all, the current policy is indifferent to the suffering the children will experience in the name of punishing the parents, so why not ramp it up? Surely that would be an even better deterrent.The president and his advisers routinely recommend harsh immigration measures on the grounds of national security and crime, as if our borders are being overrun by terrorists and rapists. A Republican National Committee campaign spot shows Nancy Pelosi criticizing President Trump's use of the term ""animals"" regarding gang members. Her comments are juxtaposed against a gruesome story of a Satanic murder committed by a ""Guatemalan native,"" and other stories of crimes committed by MS-13. The tagline: ""Democrats' midterm message: MS-13 killers ... they aren't so bad."" At his Tennessee rally, President Trump, with characteristic judiciousness, told the crowd that Pelosi ""loves MS-13.""But it's flatly false to say that immigrants are disproportionately represented among offenders. The Cato Institute has published several studies showing that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born, and illegal immigrants are the most law-abiding of all. Overall crime rates in the United States, despite an uptick in murders in certain cities since 2014, have declined by 64% since 1990, while immigration rates spiked (immigration rates have declined since 2005). A study by four universities found that the 10 regions that had the largest increases in immigrants all had lower levels of crime in 2016 than in 1980.Of course there are awful cases. But the plural of anecdote is not data, and the appeal to fear is contemptible. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen expressed alarm that 300,000 would-be border crossers are apprehended yearly. But this is a stark drop from just 18 years ago, when more than 1.6 million were stopped. At the same time, more people are now leaving the U.S. to return to Mexico than arriving from Mexico.The dueling anecdote game can be played endlessly. ICE has arrested an illegal alien adult with Down syndrome, whose three siblings and father live in the U.S. An armed ICE agent was videotaped using a crowbar to enter a home. When the occupants demanded a warrant, he said, ""You're watching too many movies.""Most ICE agents doubtless follow the law and shouldn't be tarred by the bad acts of a few. The same can be said of immigrants.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

Shares of those two institutions remain near the lows of their current price consolidations and underperform other holdings.There's been multiple factors influencing the brokerage and exchange companies this year. Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock has yet to recover. Lazard (LAZ) has been basing most of the year.The ETF itself is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 69.49 buy point.

Square, which tried to break out amid the selling Tuesday, moved back above the buy zone Wednesday, while Mastercard and Visa remain above entry points.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) tumbled between 4% and 6% Tuesday each as investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, pushing the rate on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.79%. The two-year yield skidded, but not as much, to 2.34%, squeezing the yield spread and banks' profitability on loans. (These Wall Street giants rose modestly Wednesday, with Treasury yields recouping some losses.)But financial stocks with less exposure to falling interest rates were relatively unscathed. Visa and Mastercard, for example, oversee vast payment networks but don't issue credit cards directly, unlike fellow Dow Jones components JPMorgan and American Express (AXP). That means they aren't exposed to lower rates or credit risk directly.

That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCalling the cruelest among us names such as ""animal"" or any other ""dehumanizing"" epithet actually protects humans. The word ""beastly"" exists for a reason and is frequently applied to human beings. By rhetorically reading certain despicable people out of the human race, we elevate the human race. We have declared certain behaviors out of line with being human.Biologically, of course, we are all human. But if ""human"" is to mean anything moral -- anything beyond the purely biological -- then some people who have committed particularly heinous acts of evil against other human beings are not to be considered human. Otherwise ""human"" has no moral being. We should then not retain the word ""inhumane."" What is the difference between ""he is inhumane"" and ""he is an animal""? Both imply actions that render the person no longer human.Dionne provides his answer at the end of the paragraph: ""dehumanizing others always leads us down a dangerous path.""He provides not a single argument or illustration for this truly absurd comment.Anyone who refuses to ""dehumanize"" the Nazi physicians -- who, with no anesthesia, froze naked people for hours and then dropped them in boiling water to rewarm them; put people in depressurized rooms where their eardrums burst, driving them out of their minds from pain; rubbed wood shavings and ground glass into infected wounds, etc. -- is, to put it very gently, profoundly morally confused.What would Dionne have us call those Nazi physicians -- ""not nice,"" ""badly flawed,"" ""evil""? Why is rhetorically ostracizing them from the human race ""a dangerous path""? He doesn't have an answer because he lives in the left's world of moral-sounding platitudes.

But based on their relative reactions to the sadists of the MS-13 gangs, I trust Donald Trump's moral compass more than E. J. Dionne's.It is ever dangerous to use dehumanizing rhetoric on people? Of course -- when it is directed at people based on their race, religion, ethnicity, nationality or any other immutable physical characteristic. The Nazis did what they did to Jews and others because they dehumanized them based on their religious/ethnic/racial identity. That's why racism is evil. But why is it dangerous to use such rhetoric on people based on their behavior? By equating labeling the cruelest among us ""animals"" with labeling Jews ""animals,"" Dionne cheapens the fight against real evil.I once asked Rabbi Leon Radzik, a Holocaust survivor who had been in Auschwitz, what word he would use to characterize the sadistic guards in the camp. I will never forget his response: ""They were monsters with a human face.""Incredibly, Dionne would not agree with him.Other columns by Dennis Prager

872,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and other bank stocks cruised higher from late 2017 to February on diet of rising Treasury yields, a more-hawkish Fed rate hike outlook, lower corporate taxes, deregulation and a strengthening economy.The Federal Reserve spooked Wall Street by sanctioning Wells Fargo (WFC), sending the stock tumbling in early February. Other big bank stocks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup (C) also retreated.Even as analysts await some big first-quarter earnings gains from the banks, fears of a protracted trade battle with China have raised questions about the impact on the economy, Fed rates and the stock market. Bank stocks are heavily dependent on the economy and interest rates. Their relative strength lines, which measure a stock's performance against the S&P 500, have also flattened.But this is not that unusual. Bank stocks can lead the general market for a stretch, as they did modestly from September to February. But over the long term they struggle to outperform the S&P 500 index, as shown by RS lines. Bank stocks are a big part of the benchmark S&P 500, so if financial stocks are doing well they'll help lift the overall market.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (MS) had a decent run in much of 2017 vs. the S&P 500. But Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup had different issues that held them back.Shares of JPMorgan Chase are making their way through a flat base with a 119.43 buy point.

The Federal Reserve in February hit Wells with sanctions that will prevent it from growing, citing ""widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns"" after revelations that employees were creating fake consumer accounts in attempt to hit lofty sales goals, as well as suspicious practices elsewhere.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reportedly will levy big fines on Wells Fargo soon, Reuters reported Monday.But even before the early February tumble, Wells has been lagging the S&P 500 since late 2016, or even July 2015.Wells Fargo earnings are due Friday.With its large U.S. business, Bank of America, which climbed 0.8% on Monday, is most sensitive to the Fed's actions on interest rates.

The management team will also examine the high costs of end-of-life care, and determine ""why costly and specialized medicine and pharmaceuticals are frequently over- and under-utilized.""He added that the management team would work on improving wellness programs related to smoking and obesity. It will also focus on employee access to telemedicine options.Jamie Dimon also said the team would focus on ""better customer engagement and the improved creation of customer choice."" He stressed that high deductible plans ""have barely worked.""""This effort is just beginning, and we intend to start small,"" Dimon said. ""We will report on our progress in the coming years.""Some complaints around trade are legitimate, Dimon said. But ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war"" could endanger the global economy, he said. China on Wednesday proposed $50 billion in tariffs on a wide range of American products. That matched President Trump's planned duties.The brinkmanship has roiled markets in recent days, and follows U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel from China and others and China's response — a tariff on 128 U.S. products.Dimon recommended that the U.S. ""revisit"" and repair the multi-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact intended as a counterbalance to China's global economic influence. President Trump pulled out of the deal last year.The U.S., he said, should clearly lay out what it wants from China, listen closely to the nation's grievances, and do so in partnership with Japan and Europe.""The TPP could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between America and its allies, particularly Asia,"" Dimon said.He added: ""This is not against China: The country could at some point be offered the opportunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards, which would improve upon the rules-based global trading system under American leadership.""Dimon said that due to Trump's tax cuts and the prospect of lighter regulations, JPMorgan hopes to use more excess capital to expand its business and support its employees.""We want to remind our shareholders that we much prefer to use our capital to grow than to buy back stock,"" he said.JPMorgan Chase is starting to roll out technology such as a mobile banking pilot and facial recognition. But the financial giant also will expand branch locations into areas like Washington, D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. It hopes to expand into 15-20 new markets over the next five years.The company also believes it can grow its trading division and its investment banking division, where global market share is low.""We see growth opportunities even in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities, where we already have the #1 market share at 11.4%,"" he said.""This opportunity would be true for Investment Banking, too,"" he said. ""Country by country and industry by industry, there are still plenty of opportunities to increase our low market share. For example, we have 10% share in the United States but less than 5% share in Asia.""But Dimon warned that investors are underestimating the risks of ""drastic action"" by the Federal Reserve.""While in the past, interest rates have been lower and for longer than people expected, they may go higher and faster than people expect,"" he said.Bank of America (BAC) rose 1.5%, Citigroup (C) climbed 1.3%, Goldman Sachs (GS) advanced 1.3% and Morgan Stanley (MS) 2.2%.

878,MS,"New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is threatening to sue the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for its ongoing raids to detain illegal immigrants wanted for serious crimes like assault and rape.A staggering 80% of those apprehended in recent ICE raids in New York were either convicted criminals or charged with crimes. But Cuomo's siding with criminals over crime victims.He's playing politics. Faced with a challenge on his left flank from ""Sex and the City"" star and gubernatorial hopeful Cynthia Nixon, he's desperate to prove his liberal bona fides. Public safety be damned.The ambitious New York Governor is parroting Democrats across the nation who claim ICE should be abolished because it's breaking apart families and peaceful communities. The facts prove otherwise. Eighty-eight percent of the illegal immigrants arrested in recent Los Angeles ICE raids and 81% arrested throughout California, according to the latest ICE data, had criminal convictions.These are bad guys.So when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claims that ""unjust and cruel"" ICE raids ""terrorize innocent immigrant families,"" don't buy it.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCuomo's making the same bogus claim. Last Thursday, Cuomo denounced an ICE raid on an upstate farm looking for Marcial DeLeon-Aguilar, a three-time prior deportee convicted of felony aggravated assault. The governor complained that Aguilar's children had to watch their father being pinned by officers to block his escape.Nice try, governor. What about families victimized by violent illegal immigrants?Since January 2016, at least 25 Long Island youths have been executed by the MS-13 gang of Central American illegal immigrants. Some of the victims are left so mutilated they can hardly be identified. MS-13 beats the youngsters with baseball bats, puts plastic bags over their heads to suffocate them, and then slices off their noses, ears and lips with machetes. No one read these victims their constitutional rights.ICE's Operation Matador targets MS-13 gang members. Yet Cuomo seems angrier at the ICE agents than at the MS-13 butchers.Laughably, Cuomo issued a ""cease and desist"" letter to ICE last week, ordering federal agents to touch base with local police before taking enforcement action. Cuomo doesn't have a constitutional leg to stand on. Check the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Uncle Sam doesn't need Andrew Cuomo's permission to enforce federal laws.Why the surge in visible, violent sweeps? ICE is forced to conduct sweeps out in the community because New York's sanctuary laws are preventing the agency from taking custody of criminal aliens before they're released from jail, like the agency used to do. As ICE's Deputy Director Thomas Homan points out, these sanctuary policies are needlessly exposing New Yorkers to violence.Cuomo's mimicking California Democrats, who are in open rebellion against federal law enforcement. In February, Oakland California Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public alert about a planned ICE raid in her city before it took place, tipping off hundreds of wanted criminals to scatter. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said to Shaaf, ""How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda?""Political pandering is driving this agenda. An amazing 27% of California's population are immigrants. Immigrants disproportionately favor big government. California hasn't elected a statewide Republican since 2006. New York is moving in the same direction, with 23% of its population foreign-born and Democrats gaining increasing control of state government.Cuomo and other Democrats resist the federal crackdown on immigrant-related crime, and call for increased spending on after-school music and sports programs to provide an ""alternative"" to gang activity in immigrant communities. That's nonsense. Brutes willing to torture and mutilate a human being with a machete will not be dissuaded by learning to play the flute.President Trump calls them ""animals"" who have turned peaceful neighborhoods ""into bloodstained killing fields."" He's got the right plan: ""We will find you. We will arrest you. We will jail you. And we will deport you.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:By Handing Out Driver's Licenses, Far-Left California Invites Illegals To Stay — And Taxpayers To PayCalifornia's Loopy 'Sanctuary State' Law — Is It Trying To Secede?Census Citizenship Question: 5 Arguments Against It All Bogus

879,MS,"CAN SLIM investing in growth stocks can be a good match with retirement plans? Why?When it comes to generating retirement income from stocks via dividend investing, capital gains still matter. That's the main ingredient of growth stocks, which IBD's CAN SLIM investing method favors.This sounds unconventional if one thinks the only ""sure"" way to generate retirement income from stocks is to load up on century-old blue chip stocks. Either those or big utilities that pay a solid dividend, quarter after quarter.Yet an ""unconventional"" approach to finding, buying and selling stocks can be a gold mine of income for disciplined investors. What does it take? The ability to follow investing rules and don't let opinions interfere with the process.So why not employ the research-driven technique of selecting the best growth stock companies to enhance your annual return? By doing so you can avoid long-term erosion of your nest egg.It takes true commitment to study and monitor the market, learning from mistakes, and some patience to generate income from stocks. Mastering IBD's seven-point CAN SLIM investing paradigm for selecting, buying and selling stocks takes discipline. But the rewards are clear.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSuppose you have a $500,000 retirement account. You need $50,000 a year to live comfortably. If none of that money in your retirement account is invested, the gas tank goes empty in 10 years.You'll get income if you invested the entire wad in a basket of stocks that pay dividends with, say, an annual yield of 3%. That's well more than the 2% the S&P 500 provides today. Assuming no change in underlying stock prices, you could expect to receive $15,000 of cash dividends. Not enough income for your spending needs.Consider this option. Allocate half of the $500,000 toward highly ranked growth stocks. Ranked by what? Earnings growth, sales, profit margin, return on equity, industry leadership and rising fund sponsorship, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. You limit your buys to just six stocks during the year, investing $50,000 each time. Assume none of these stocks pay cash back to shareholders.Suppose three of the stocks turn out to be losers. You cut losses at -5% (equal to a $2,500 loss), -8% (-$4,000) and -8% (-$4,000). The other three make money. You achieve gains of 10% ($5,000 profit), 20% ($10,000) and 50% ($25,000). By year's end, you've amassed a net short-term capital gain of $29,500 before taxes, a return of almost 12% on half of your total portfolio.Now, suppose you place the other $250,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds, ultrasteady megacap blue chips with dividends yields of 2% to 4%. And some of that to perhaps some municipal bonds. Then you might earn approximately $7,500 in interest and dividend payments or more. This boosts your total gain to $37,000. The total return hits 7.4%.IBD's TAKE: The Dividend Leaders screen, part of IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, is one place to look for dividend-rich companies with highly stable earnings, critical for paying out future dividends.Now, withdraw 5% of the total portfolio, or $25,000, for your living expenses. Use Social Security and pensions to get the additional income for living costs. That leaves an extra $12,000 in your portfolio, giving the account a total boost of roughly 2.4%. That's enough to counter a potential loss of purchasing power due to inflation.Rinse and repeat. Chances look good that your nest egg will last a long time.You can start your search by looking at growth stock screens at Investors.com and in the IBD Weekly. IBD Big Cap 20 is a good place to look for stocks with both growth potential and cash payouts. Superregional banks Regions Financial (RF) and Northern Trust (NTRS), as well as investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and insurer Sun Life Financial (SLF) joined the Big Cap 20 in the Nov. 14, 2016, edition of IBD Weekly. All four pay dividends to shareholders, but capital gains in the months that followed proved more valuable to shareholders.Since then, Regions has done well. Even amid the current market correction, through Thursday's close, the Birmingham, Ala., institution has doubled from a 10.10 long saucer buy point; Northern Trust has climbed 50% past a 73.84 cup with handle entry; Morgan Stanley has rolled ahead 82% since an early October breakout past 32.47. And Sun Life has risen as much as 31% past a 33.93 saucer-with-handle pivot point before correcting again and working on a brand-new base.Sector rotation can hamper traditional income-generating plays. Consider Verizon (VZ). In late January 2016, the telecom rallied past a 47.33 buy point within a long saucer base and gained 20% by July 5. But over the next four months, Verizon gave back all of that gain. In 2017, integrated telecoms turned out to be market laggards.Instead of sitting through the disappointing round trip, use IBD's common-sense sell rule of taking at least some gains at 20%-25%. Redeploy the money in a more promising growth stock investment or park the profits in cash. In some cases, you need to take profits more quickly, especially when the market's ride gets rough.Alphabet (GOOGL) serves up a recent example. The megacap tech broke out of an 11-week flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point on Oct. 11, 2017. After a brief stumble, the stock really got moving a few weeks later, thanks to a strong gap up in price on Oct. 27. That helped spark a nearly 19% run to a new high of 1,197 on Jan. 29 of this year.But as seen in a daily chart, Alphabet succumbed to the sharp volatility and fast correction seen in stocks in early February. By Feb. 8, the Google search engine owner completed a round-trip of those solid gains. Lesson? It's fine to sell and preserve at least some profits before they all disappear. You can always buy a great stock such as Alphabet again.Do not dismiss the strategy of raising cash near major market tops. No matter how great a company's management or how big the cash dividend, you want to sidestep serious damage to any of your growth stocks. You can always buy shares back when market conditions improve. Reading IBD's The Big Picture column will help you spot these all-important junctures in the market.Will you panic and sell late if stocks go into a bear market? At some point, equities will fall hard again. Just look at the equity markets in 1990, 1998, 2000-02, 2008-09 and 2011. In every instance, at least one major index fell 20% or more from its 52-week peak.

880,MS,"Shares of Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are sliding Thursday on continued interest rates concerns. The 10-year Treasury yield edged down while spread between that long-term rate and the 2-year yield remains narrow.Even as the Treasury yield recently hit a four-year high of 3.02%, most bank stocks didn't rally because short-term yields continued to gradually close the gap. A narrower yield spread weighs on net interest margins for banks, and the Treasury yield curve is now at its flattest levels since the period just before the Great Recession.On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.95%, but off intraday lows. The 2-year yield edged down to 2.48%.As expected, the Fed did not unveil any new rate hikes on Wednesday, which was not enough to lift stocks for long.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

They included Marathon Oil (MRO) (up 6% in double average volume) and Tableau Software (DATA) (up nearly 7% in more than four times usual turnover).The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a tiny gain of 5 points as it notched a positive reversal. Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages. But some fast-growing banks, such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and SVB Financial (SIVB), have been holding up much more firmly.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on leading stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside The Big Picture?

882,MS,"The debt tsunami that is projected to slam the United States is overwhelmingly driven by escalating Social Security and health care entitlement costs. That is the conclusion of a bipartisan consensus of economists and policy experts including staff from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB), top think tank economists on the left and right, and even politicians ranging from House Speaker Paul Ryan to President Barack Obama. The only real disagreement has been on the preferred mixture of tax and spending solutions.This is why many were stunned when five elite liberal economists recently published a Washington Post op-ed titled ""A Debt Crisis Is Coming. But Don't Blame Entitlements.""The authors were five former Democratic chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers — Martin Neil Baily, Jason Furman, Alan Krueger, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, and Janet Yellen, who was also Chair of the Federal Reserve. These highly-respected economists asserted that the consensus that entitlements are primarily driving the future debt is incomplete, and that the 2017 tax cuts are as much to blame as entitlement spending.This conclusion — and the unconventional arguments employed to support it — baffled many economists and columnists, earning responses from John Cochrane, Ramesh Ponnuru, Justin Fox, and Veronique de Rugy. I added my own quick dissent on this page last week.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBecause the coming debt tsunami is perhaps the most important economic issue America faces, it is vital to understand its causes. Thus, I have ten questions for Mr. Baily, Mr. Furman, Mr. Krueger, Ms. Tyson, and Ms. Yellen.Group A: Overall trends:1) You focus on the 2017 tax cuts as one of the primary causes of long-term debt. Yet last summer — before the tax cuts — CBO had already forecast the budget deficit rising from 3% to 10% of GDP by 2047. How can a subsequent 1 percent of GDP tax cut be a major cause of a budget deficit that was already rising by 7% of GDP due to other policies?2) You recommend that readers ""don't blame entitlements"" for the coming long-term debt explosion — and instead elevate the tax cuts as an equal cause. However, over the 2017 to 2047 period, CBO estimates that total entitlement spending will rise by 4.8% of GDP, and the resulting interest costs on the Social Security and Medicare program shortfalls will add another 4% of GDP. Last year's tax cuts – if extended – will cost roughly one percent of GDP. Does this not conclusively show that escalating entitlement costs are driving the overwhelming majority of the coming debt?Group B: Your central data point is that ""the tax cuts passed last year actually added an amount to America's long-run fiscal challenge that is roughly the same size as the preexisting shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare."" On Twitter, one of you clarified this point as ""The CBO fiscal gap is ~2% of GDP. The tax cuts if made permanent are ~1% of GDP."" The 2% figure seems to consist of the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds. This brings up several questions:3) Even your own (incomplete) figures show a Social Security and Medicare shortfall twice as large as the 2017 tax cuts. How is that ""roughly the same size as the preexisting shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare?"" The one percent differential is not some pedantic margin of error, it is equal to the total size of the tax cuts. And if tax cuts totaling one percent of GDP are a fiscal catastrophe, then how does your own 2% of GDP Social Security and Medicare shortfall lead to the conclusion of ""don't blame entitlements?""4) More importantly, since when do entitlement costs include only the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds? Over the next few decades, subsidies to Medicare B and D are projected to grow rapidly and (if combined) become the largest federal expenditure from general revenues. How do you justify not even acknowledging these surging entitlement costs? And how do you justify excluding Medicaid, which is projected by CBO to expand by 0.8% of GDP over the next 30 years, from your entitlement cost figures?5) Essentially, your entire argument rests on a rhetorical bait-and-switch. The article repeatedly asserts that ""entitlements"" — which you broadly and accurately define as mainly ""Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and Medicaid"" — are not contributing as much to future deficits as others claim. Yet for evidence, you suddenly shift to measuring only the trust fund deficits of Social Security and Medicare Part A. So virtually all entitlement programs that are primarily funded through general revenues — such as Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid — are simply not counted, as if they do not exist or have any fiscal effect. How can any credible measurement of long-term entitlement costs not include Medicaid and all of Medicare? They are large and growing entitlements.6) Perhaps you would answer the previous question by asserting that segregated trust fund programs such as Social Security and Medicare Part A should not be compared to the general fund, which mixes countless tax and spending policies and do not so cleanly represent future federal obligations. If that is the case, your use of trust fund deficits to measure the total budgetary effect of entitlements is still incorrect.More importantly, that would present another obvious inconsistency. If general fund programs like Medicaid and Medicare Part B/D should not count as contributing to the long-term debt, then why do you harshly criticize the 2017 tax cuts, which are part of the same general fund? Under what possible basis could — within the general fund — tax cuts count as adding long-term debt, but soaring Medicaid costs not count?7) You compare an annual cost — 1% of GDP in tax cuts — to the 75-year net present value shortfall for Social Security and Medicare Part A. But net present values are not the same as annual average costs or program deficits. Is it not true that a more accurate comparison would match up the one percent annual tax cost with the annual average shortfall of those programs?Group C: Past and short-term deficits:8) Assessing the past, you write that: ""The federal budget was in surplus from 1998 through 2001, but large tax cuts and unfunded wars have been huge contributors to our current deficit problem."" Well, compared to that 2001 surplus, CBO reports that entitlement spending is 3.4% of GDP higher, defense and war spending is up 0.2% of GDP, and revenues are down 2.2% of GDP. This means that — compared to the 2001 surplus you reference — the current deficit is driven mostly by entitlements. So why did you completely exclude them from your diagnosis?9) Projecting the future, you write that: ""The primary reason the deficit in coming years will now be higher than had been expected is the reduction in tax revenue from last year's tax cuts, not an increase in spending."" But over the next decade, CBO estimates that entitlements will rise by 2.5% of GDP, while the tax cuts will cost 1% of GDP. That tax cuts are making the deficit ""higher than had been expected"" merely means that we already knew entitlement costs were soaring before the tax cuts were enacted. Is not the relative cost of the policies more important than which one happened to be more recent and perhaps unexpected?10) Defending the op-ed on Twitter, one of you wrote that ""Deficit is T(axes) – G(overnment spending). Don't know how you can say (the deficit) is caused by T or G."" This seems to assert that the budget deficit is simply the failure to match spending and revenues, so we cannot single out any individual cause like growing entitlement costs. However, your own op-ed singles out that ""large tax cuts and unfunded wars have been huge contributors to our current deficit problem,"" and that recent tax cuts will widen future deficits. So are you asserting that tax cuts and defense spending can be isolated for their deficit effect, yet entitlement costs cannot?I look forward to your response to these questions as we work to ensure long-term fiscal solvency.

883,MS,"SVB Financial Group (SIVB) rocketed through its buy point Friday as the Silicon Valley Bank parent gapped up as earnings and revenue growth accelerated yet again.Easily Friday's top performer on the S&P 500 index on Friday, SVB Financial handily outperformed banking behemoths such as Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). It also drove the Banks-Super Regional Industry Group higher, despite the relatively static performance of its peers Friday.SVB Financial's EPS rocketed 90% to $3.63 per share, while revenue soared 34% to $575 million. That smashed estimates for EPS of $3.13 on revenue of $536 million. Earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for five straight quarters.Silicon Valley Bank's parent also raised its full-year guidance for the year. It expects average loan balances to increase at a high-teens percentage rate instead of its prior outlook for the midteens, while deposit balances increase in the low double digits vs. earlier guidance for the mid-single digits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

A rising RS line shows that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500 index.Silicon Valley Bank focuses on lending to technology companies. It has helped fund more than 30,000 startups, including Airbnb, Pinterest and TrueCar (TRUE). SVB Financial also serves venture capital and private equity firms investing in the tech and biotech fields. It also offers private banking services for high-net-worth individuals.It has an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98, putting it in the top 2% of stocks, and ranks first in the Banks-Super Regional Group.Fifth Third Bank (FITB) on Tuesday gapped up 4.1% on strong earnings. The superregional bank, up 0.6% Friday, rallied 7.6% for the week, closing in on a 34.67 cup-base buy point.Zions Bancorp (ZION), which is part of the Banks-West/Southwest group, nearly hit a buy point Tuesday on its own strong earnings. Zions Bancorp rose 1% Friday to end the week up 3.35%.Fifth Third Bank has a Composite Rating of 90. Zions has a 94 CR.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase edged 0.6% lower, while Bank of America edged 0.3% higher.

884,MS,"Accountability: MSNBC's Joy Reid has found herself in hot water over politically incorrect blog posts she apparently wrote more than a decade ago. We couldn't care less about that. But her highly dubious claim that her old blog was hacked is important. If she's lying, she has no business being a journalist.Back in December, Reid apologized when some of her old writings on a long-defunct blog surfaced, in which she repeatedly used homophobic slurs about Gov. Charlie Crist. In her apology, Reid said she was just trying to ""call out potential hypocrisy"" of Crist, but nevertheless said her comments were ""insensitive, tone deaf and dumb""This week, however, the same cybersleuth exposed many other decade-old Reid posts from the same blog, all of them in one way or another mocking gays, same-sex marriage, transgenderism — none of which Reid could brush off as ""calling out hypocrisy"" about a Republican.But instead of apologizing for these new revelations, Reid claimed this new batch of homophobic blog posts were doctored up phonies. According to claims made by Reid and her attorney, they'd either been Photoshopped or her blog was hacked.As far as we are concerned, what Reid wrote 10 years ago when she was a relatively unknown journalist in Florida is immaterial. She's said worse things since becoming a national fixture at MSNBC (none of which landed her in hot water with her network). A small sampling:Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

885,MS,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereWhat matters isn't what she wrote as a Florida blogger, but the dubious things she's saying about those posts now. By denying authorship, she's opened herself up to the charge of lying, or worse.Her lawyer's Photoshop claim, for example, was easily disproved when the same posts showed up on other archives, one of them at the Library of Congress.The hacking claim is also highly unlikely.The Internet Archive, which repeatedly crawls Web pages and stores snapshots, says it found no evidence that anyone tampered with its archive. ""At least some of the examples of allegedly fraudulent posts provided to us had been archived at different dates and by different entities,"" it said.According to computer scientist Michael Nelson, that means the hacker ""would have had to hack multiple web archives and alter their contents.""That leaves the equally implausible alternative: That someone hacked Reid's blog at the time she was writing it more than a decade ago. And that she was totally unaware of these wholesale alterations at the time.Even liberal journalists are having a hard time swallowing this. Writing in the Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal says that ""the evidence is not with Joy Reid."" The Daily Beast announced Thursday that it was suspending her column. And a prominent LBGT group rescinded a media award after the new blog posts emerged.Nevertheless, Reid sticks to her hacking story, while her lawyer says the FBI is investigating ""potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts.""So to sum up:Either Reid is telling the truth, despite her shifting and increasingly incredulous claims. Or she has flat out lied to the public and — as a bonus — is now wasting FBI resources. Or maybe she's delusional about her own past views and writings.If turns out that she lied to protect her left-wing reputation, MSNBC should show her the door. If she knowingly diverted FBI resources to investigate a bogus hacking claim, she should face legal consequences.Either way, the network and the liberal press can't let Reid brush this under the rug.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:FBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeLawsuit By Dems: A Sad Attempt To Push 'Reset Button' On Hillary's Disastrous 2016 LossDemocrats' Latest Big Gov't Idea: Guaranteed Jobs For Everyone!

887,MS,"Sometimes a stock will break out, but then soon pull back below the buy point. But if it hasn't fallen too far, the buy point is still valid. That's the case with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), PayPal (PYPL), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Morgan Stanley (MS).These stocks generally pulled back in light volume as the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite retreated. None of them came close to falling 7%-8% below their entry points, which would trigger an automatic sell signal. They are worth watching in case they reenter buy zones, especially in strong volume.Their relative strength lines, which track the stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index, are generally at or near the highs of their consolidation.Apple and Microsoft, both Dow components, were roughly 1.5% off their entry points as of Friday's close.

888,MS,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite rose strongly early in the week, but then erased most of those gains by Friday's close. Netflix (NFLX) soared on subscriber growth and guidance, while energy stocks busted higher as crude oil prices kept rising. Alcoa (AA), American Express (AXP) and UnitedHealth (UNH) jumped on their Q1 reports. That offset weak outlooks from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and chip-gear giants Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML). The broader chip sector and Apple (AAPL) came under pressure.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite were all up more than 1% through Thursday, but by Friday's close were up about 0.5%. The major averages rallied through Wednesday on Netflix (NFLX) earnings and oil-fueled energy stocks. Stocks pulled back as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) warned on the rest of 2018, citing weak smartphone demand. Already pressured by weak ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) guidance, chip stocks sold off. Apple (AAPL) also came under heavy pressure Thursday and Friday on iPhone demand concerns. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.958%, a four-year high.Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) added 7.41 million streaming subscribers in the first quarter, beating its target for 6.35 million. It ended the March quarter with 125 million subscribers worldwide. Netflix expects to add 6.2 million subscribers in Q2, topping Wall Street's target of 5.2 million. Netflix also topped Q1 EPS and sales figures and guided higher for those metrics in Q2. Q1 subscriber numbers benefited from new original content such as science-fiction series ""Altered Carbon"" and fresh seasons of comic-book series ""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" and comedy ""Grace and Frankie."" Shares shot up to a record high.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) cut its sales outlook for the rest of the year, largely on softer smartphone demand, slamming chip stocks and Apple (AAPL). Taiwan Semi is the world's largest contract chipmaker and counts Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) among its customers. Meanwhile, chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML Holding (ASML) pressured semiconductor stocks a day earlier with weak outlooks.

But on Tuesday, the count rose to the most in five weeks, according to preliminary data. This would be another sign that the market uptrend is real.Bullishness, though, isn't shared everywhere. The banks have had trouble getting credit for any earnings report.Goldman Sachs became the latest big bank to report strong quarterly results and then shrug off the performance. Goldman's earnings came in well above estimates. But the stock reversed to a 1.8% loss in heavy volume.Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) reported a 51% increase in earnings, above the consensus estimate.

Banks don't like the Dodd-Frank regulations, but the Republicans have not been able to unite on a plan to either repeal or amend the law.The selling in bank stocks could be profit-taking, given the run-ups many banks enjoyed in 2017.Meanwhile, Apple is showing that no news can be good news. Apple rose 1.4% as it notched its ninth gain in 11 sessions. This was accomplished without an earnings report.Apple will report quarterly results May 1 after the close. The stock is only 3% off its high, forming a base with a 183.60 buy point.Analysts expect Apple's quarterly earnings to jump 29% to $2.70 a share.

The indexes broke above the 50-day line Tuesday morning and closed above the line with no trouble along the way.A close above the line helps validate the market's uptrend.If the 50-day line has been converted from resistance into support, the next resistance area would be at the 7500 price level for the Nasdaq and the 2800 area for the S&P 500.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The stock surged 5.7% to clear a 79.50 buy point in a flat base. The pattern, though, is a late-stage one.Chemical products maker Celanese (CE) gapped up about 4%. The stock broke above a 109.35 buy point in a double-bottom base. A double-bottom base is shaped like the letter W.

The charges range from 50 basis points for accounts of more than $5 million to 1.5% for customers with less than $500,000. Currently, fees are tied more closely to the individual products, said Robert Beauregard, a Fidelity spokesman.""This should make it easier for customers to understand what they are paying,"" he said in an interview.Firms like Morgan Stanley (MS) and Merrill Lynch have already moved to a unified system, where customers pay a single price based on their relationship with the firm, said Tom O'Shea, research director for managed accounts at Cerulli Associates in Boston.The Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier Wednesday.The advice business has been under pressure. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Labor passed a fiduciary rule which required brokers to put clients' interests ahead of their own when handling retirement investments. While the future of that rule is unclear, it has been credited with pushing more advisors toward a fee-based system and for speeding the adoption of low-cost index products.At the same time, robo-advisers are building portfolios for clients at a fraction of the cost typically charged by advisors. Fidelity has its own robo product, called Fidelity Go, which charges 35 basis points for accounts with as little as $5,000.Boston-based Fidelity's wealth management business has just over $300 billion in assets.RELATED:Fidelity Brokerage Clients Value Speed And Innovation

902,MS,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio. Custodian banks, like Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and Northern Trust (NTRS) would be the likeliest to benefit.But JPMorgan and Citi, which also handle similar deposits, argue that provision should apply to them as well. Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today.

The stock is 2% below a 32.77 buy point. The stock twice hit or topped that level last week, but reversed lower in both sessions, meaning the flat base was still valid as of Friday's close. BofA's RS line is holding at highs and has been trending gradually higher over the last six months.Bank of America has had two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth.Visa rose 0.9% to 121.88 in Monday's trading, continuing to find 50-day-line support. Visa is working on a 127.98 buy point, though an aggressive trader could look at 125.40 as an alternative, early entry.Visa's RS line is near a record high.The Dow Jones component does not benefit from higher interest rates, unlike the other financials on this list, including fellow Dow Jones card giant American Express.

907,MS,"The Federal Reserve late Thursday released annual stress-test guidelines that will test more big banks and pit the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) against a tougher economic obstacle course than last year.X But the new rules shouldn't affect the thing that Wall Street tends to care most about when the exam results come out in June; the buyback and dividend payouts that the banks typically announce after they pass the tests, an analyst said.The GOP's new tax legislation should be ""a beneficial offset"" in the Fed's annual evaluation of banks' abilities to lend to households and businesses if the economy implodes, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The banks' pre-provision net revenue — or revenue before factoring for the money set aside to cover losses — should also ""start at a higher point,"" he added.""In the end, our current expectations for capital return are not changing despite more severe stress scenarios,"" Kleinhanzl wrote.Each year, the Fed's stress tests lays out three economic scenarios, each with different degrees of severity, that the banks have to prove they have the capital cushion to navigate.The harshest scenario this year, what the Fed calls the ""severely adverse"" scenario, envisions a severe global recession, with U.S. unemployment rate rising by nearly 6 percentage points to 10% by the third quarter of next year. That rise is a bit more than the roughly 5.25 percentage-point increase, still to 10%, in last year's scenario.And by that time, under this year's scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared to 6.5% last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's tests outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Housing and commercial real estate prices would also slide. ""Severe recessions"" would trample the eurozone, the U.K. and Japan.Also, the severe test would include ""a global aversion to long-term fixed-income assets."" As a result, the Fed said, long-term rates would not fall and yield curves would steepen.The Fed said it's dialed up the bleakness in this year's tests because it wanted a ""test of the resilience of large firms when current economic conditions are especially strong.""JPMorgan shares were down 2.2% in the stock market today. Bank of America was off 1.7%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 4.5% and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 3.4%. Citigroup (C) eased 2.75% and Wells Fargo (WFC) lost 2.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The annual grading of the banks' resilience in a crisis features two parts. First, the Dodd-Frank Act stress test shows how banks' capital would hold up under the different economic scenarios. The second, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), evaluates the banks' capital planning procedures and capital adequacy, and looks at their plans for rewarding investors with dividends and buybacks.The banks have until April 5 to submit their capital plans to the Fed. Results will be announced by June 30.Last year, all 34 banks subject to the tests passed. And the banks have gotten used to the grading process. A flood of press releases from the banks, announcing dividends and buybacks, tends to follow once they pass the second and final round of the tests.This year, 38 banks total will be tested. The Fed for the first time will also test five foreign companies with U.S. operations.The Trump administration's tax reform has mangled the buyback plans of some of the companies subject to the tests this year. American Express (AXP) said it would suspend its buyback plans for the first half of the year due to a one-time hit to profits caused by the legislation.Capital One Financial (COF) also said it would cut its buyback offering nearly in half due to a similar charge.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Beat; Wells Fargo MixedGoldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags Peers

Analysts have suggested the latter could take share from Gilead as it treats all genotypes of hepatitis C patients.AbbVie said the lion's share of its success in hepatitis C stemmed from Maviret sales outside the U.S. The drug sells as Mavyret in the U.S. and Maviret outside the U.S. International hepatitis C drug sales were $296 million in the period, in line with expectations.But U.S. sales of $214 million missed RBC analyst Brian Abrahams' estimate for $263 million. AbbVie estimates its $510 million in fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales represents about 32% of the market, Abrahams said in a note to clients.""We believe this is a positive for Gilead going into earnings, as it reinforces their prior commentary of market stabilization and downplays the potential impact of U.S. competition,"" he said in a note Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead is set to report earnings after the close on Feb. 6.

917,MS,"The Democrats blinked in the first round of the government-shutdown fight over immigration, but they promise to regroup and fight again for immigrants living in America illegally who came as minors. The Democrats call them ""Dreamers,"" and so, the ""Facts First"" media employ that loaded propaganda term as well.XOne might argue ""Dreamers"" is only a technical term, an acronym for the never-passed Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act designed to grant conditional permanent residency to those who immigrated illegally as children. It was first introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin and Orrin Hatch in 2001.It is perfectly reasonable for politicians to plop an appealing title on legislation: the Clean Air Act, the Highway Beautification Act, President Trump's Tax Cut and Jobs Act. But while both parties do it, there is a key difference. Republicans know theirs will be derided by the press. Democrats know the same media will be their megaphones.For example, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed a short-term spending bill last Friday before the government shutdown, Nancy Cordes of CBS reported, ""He says this hardball strategy is the only way to force GOP leaders to the table before hundreds of thousands of immigrant Dreamers face deportation.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveSometimes they qualify it by saying things like ""so-called Dreamers"" or ""what they call 'Dreamers,'"" which adds at least a fraction of emotional distance. In print, they might add quotation marks.But overall, they don't qualify. It's an emotional investment. Liberal-media outlets already portray immigrants of all ages who are here illegally as a virtuous and deserving category, as better humans than people with, well, ""citizenship privilege."" In fact, when was the last time you heard a journalist use the term ""illegal alien""? Or ""illegal"" anything? But the ""Dreamers"" are even more wonderful.Here's a typical New York Times lede on the subject, from last August: ""Jessica Rojas beat poverty to put herself through engineering college, where she collected accolades for academic achievement. After graduating last year, Ms. Rojas, who grew up in Chicago, was hired by a utility company to help modernize the city's electrical grid.""You won't read in The New York Times, ""Jessica Rojas broke federal law by sneaking into this country illegally.""The media claim to love facts, and they suggest their critics can't handle facts and traffic in phony ""alternative facts."" But they have a way of being very careful in organizing the facts to match their policy preferences. So if the children of those living in the country illegally were to join the vicious Salvadoran gang MS-13, they wouldn't be starring in a New York Times story on ""Dreamers."" Only the valedictorians and electrical engineers represent this group.Liberals claim to love humanity, with hearts that must be two sizes larger than the average American. But not every category of vulnerable humans gets this treatment. Consider the hundreds of thousands of unborn babies who are aborted each year in this country. They are not considered part of humanity. Reporters refer to them using the cold, clinical term ""fetus."" These humans never get a chance to get an engineering degree to gain your sympathy. No journalist calls them ""Dreamers.""Instead, a year ago, The New York Times rolled out an article on the ""Christian"" abortion provider Dr. Willie Parker and allowed him to play philosopher. ""Life is a process, not an event,"" he argued. ""If I thought I was killing a person, I wouldn't do abortions. A fetus is not a person; it's a human entity.""But the Times interviewer, Ana Marie Cox, said in one question that she worries about ""abortion access"" being damaged by ""the sacralization of motherhood,"" and she ended the question by telling Parker, ""you seem pretty cool!"" In the liberal mind, deportation is a tragedy and abortion is ... pretty cool.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

918,MS,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) rocketed as much as 15% Friday on rumors it could be a takeover target for Biogen (BIIB) as well as a slew of Asian drugmakers.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acorda surged 8.8% to 27.20, after earlier soaring to 28.60. Biogen lifted a fraction, near 345.20.The rumors emerge a week after the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference when Acorda said it had boosted the potential for an inhaled Parkinson's disease drug known as Inbrija to $800 million in the U.S.Inbrija has been a sore point for Acorda in recent history, though. In August, the Food and Drug Administration refused to file Acorda's application for Inbrija, saying it was not sufficiently complete to garner a review.That was a hit to Acorda's already thin pipeline. Last April, Acorda put four drugs on the back burner to focus on Inbrija and a drug called tozadenant after a judge invalidated several patents on key multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra.But Tozadenant also has been problematic for Acorda. The drug was being tested as a Parkinson's disease therapy when five patients died in late-stage trials. Acorda paused enrollment in long-term safety trials and increased monitoring.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen stock gained steam this week as its Relative Strength Rating rose to a 72 out of a best-possible 99, up from an earlier rating of 68. This metric shows how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks compares to the rest of the market. See what went into Biogen's rating by visiting IBD Data Stories.Already Acorda has been subject to pressure for a sale. Following the FDA's refusal to file for Inbrija last year, a hedge fund acquired a 16.5% stake in the biotech and then urged it to seek a buyer.In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Acorda said it wouldn't be the best time to pursue a sale as it would not be able to ""adequately compensate shareholders for the potential benefits of the company's late-stage program.""Today, Acorda has a market cap near $1.3 billion. As of its third quarter ended Sept. 30, Biogen had more than $3.5 billion in cash, equivalents and securities on hand. It's possible Ampyra would dovetail well with Biogen's large MS franchise.Biogen declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. Acorda didn't immediately return an email requesting comment.RELATED:How Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug MakersWhy This Biotech Stock Could Outperform Expectations In Lung CancerDow's Merck Does An About-Face, Releases Cancer Trial Results

Chip-gear makers led the way, fueled by ASML (ASML) and others. Health insurers also were big winners as UnitedHealth (UNH) triggered a group rally. Energy stocks pulled back while lithium plays also sold off.Apple (AAPL) is expected to bring home $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to help pay for domestic projects, thanks to recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reforms. Apple pledged to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. That includes creating 20,000 new jobs, funding a new campus and more data centers, and forging deals with U.S. component manufacturers. Analysts say Apple likely will use some of the foreign cash for tuck-in acquisitions and to increase stock buybacks and dividends.The semiconductor equipment group led all industries for the week. ASML Holding (ASML), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) rallied on upbeat financial reports. ASML reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and Ichor and Electro Scientific each announced preliminary December-quarter sales that topped views. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) added to the party by delivering better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guiding to strong sales growth in 2018.General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery said he's mulling a breakup into separate businesses, after the industrial giant announced it will take a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter on its legacy insurance business — double earlier guidance. The charge relates to an old long-term-care portfolio. GE's finance arm will pay $15 billion through 2024 to shore up reserves, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may have to prop up GE Capital with cash at some point. Flannery will update investors on the portfolio review in the spring. Activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management reportedly is pushing for a GE breakup. GE shares tumbled 13.3% to 16.26, their lowest level in more than six years, as investors questioned whether the last original Dow component has much value.GM (GM) expects 2018 earnings to be largely in line with expected 2017 results, in the high end of the $6-6.50 range. The largest U.S. carmaker expects profits to rise in 2019 and beyond, as it shifts its lineup toward more profitable, next-gen SUVs and trucks. Analysts had expected about $6.24 for 2017 and EPS declines in 2018 and 2019. Ford (F) went the other way, forecasting 2017 earnings of $1.78 per share, below estimates. It expects EPS to dip in 2018, to $1.45-$1.70. Ford said Monday it will invest $11 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years, more than doubling an earlier target. GM shares fell 2.1%, with Ford plunging 9.3%, below a recent buy point.Charles Schwab (SCHW) earnings per share and revenue both rose 14%, both meeting views. New retail brokerage accounts jumped 36% vs. a year earlier, helping total accounts grow 4% to 7.4 million. Smaller online brokerage Interactive Brokers (IBKR) saw earnings spike more than 500%  as revenue jumped 167%, both beating. Customer accounts grew 25% and total daily trades 14%. Shares of Schwab rose a fraction for the week while Interactive fell 1%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) helped spark the Dow's run to 26,000, breaking out 6.4% to a record high after easily clearing Q4 earnings estimates and detailing the impact of tax reform. UnitedHealth earnings jumped 23% to $2.59 a share on 9.5% revenue growth. While the nation's largest insurer said it plans to use its tax windfall to boost investment, UnitedHealth expects 75% of the benefits of tax cuts to go to the bottom line. It's projecting 2018 EPS of $12.30 to $12.60, a range of 22% to 25% profit growth. Other health insurers rallied to new highs on UnitedHealth's strong report.Airbus (EADSY) had 1,109 orders last year, up 52% from 2016, beating Boeing (BA) for the sixth straight year. The European aerospace giant also will keep making the superjumbo A380 after Emirates airline made a $16 billion order at list prices. CEO Tom Enders was critical of Brexit and President Trump's ""America First"" policies but said Brexit would be more devastating to the Airbus' business. Boeing announced a joint venture with auto car seat maker Adient (ADNT) to build seats for its jets to ease congestion from Zodiac Aerospace that has delayed plane deliveries.Bitcoin fell well below $10,000 on Wednesday before rebounding to about $11,700 as of Friday morning.

BitConnect will shutter its lending services and exchange platform. While central banks warn of excessive risk with Bitcoin, companies are embracing cryptocurrencies. IBM (IBM) announced a blockchain joint venture with the Danish shipping company Maersk.Goldman Sachs (GS) topped EPS and revenue views for Q4, but its large fixed-income desk saw a 50% revenue drop, once again worse than rivals. Bank of America had mixed results, while Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) results beat. As Bitcoin's value continued to shrink this week, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said it was responding to clients' interest in the cryptocurrency, but exercising ""extreme prudence and caution."" He did not say anything about whether the bank, which has already said it would clear Bitcoin futures, would develop a crypto-trading platform of its own. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said ""customers should be careful"" with cryptocurrencies.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) stock rocketed 52% on Wednesday on a report that longtime partner Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it. Celgene and Juno are partnered to develop CAR-T drugs, rivaling the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), which recently bought Kite Pharma, and Novartis (NVS). Celgene blockbuster faces its multiple myeloma drug Revlimid going off patent. Bluebird Bio (BLUE), another CAR-T developer that partners with Celgene, rose 7.3% on Wednesday.Dow stock Merck surged Tuesday after it released the results of a trial for immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer well ahead of expectations. In October, Merck had delayed the release until 2019. In the Phase 3 trial, Merck's regimen significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival as a first treatment vs. chemotherapy alone. Roche (RHHBY), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN), which have rival drugs, retreated Tuesday.Atlassian (TEAM) topped fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue estimates. But the collaboration software maker forecast current-quarter profit of 8 cents a share on revenue of $218 million vs. consensus estimates of 11 cents and $215 million. Analysts said the light guidance was due to annual salary increases and higher payroll taxes. Jefferies hiked its price target to 64 from 53 on expectations for better future cash flow growth.

Shares dove 6.45%.Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO), have been climbing after Bernstein analysts predicted 22%-24% year-over-year gross gambling revenue gains in Macau for January.

The report was the first since the December death of its CEO Hunter Harrison, a veteran railroad executive known for reining in costs and turning around some of CSX's rivals.

(FMC) 8.2% and Global X Lithium and Battery Tech ETF (LIT) 6.2%.American Express (AXP) will suspend its buyback program in the first half of this year, after a one-off write-down on some assets and a repatriation tax from the GOP's new tax bill dented fourth-quarter profits and capital. AmEx topped Q4 profit and revenue estimates. AmEx fell 1.8% Friday but closed above its 50-day line.IBM (IBM) revenue rose 4% vs. year earlier to $22.5 billion, snapping a 24-quarter streak of flat or declining revenue, as IBM undergoes a major overhaul.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite each dipped 0.1%, as Apple (AAPL) posted a modest early gain and the four FANG stock tech leaders were mixed. Security software developer Symantec (SYMC) dropped 4% at the open, the worst loss among Nasdaq 100 stocks, following a downgrade to underperform, from hold, by Jefferies.Markets had an eye on Washington, where federal lawmakers remained at loggerheads over a budget agreement ahead of a deadline that would shut down all non-essential government offices Friday at midnight. A stop-gap spending measure that would temporarily fund the government through Feb. 15 is set for a House vote today, though early news reports declared Republicans did not have enough support to pass the measure.Wal-Mart was the early powerhouse among blue chips, up nearly 2% after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to buy, from neutral, and added the name to its Americas Conviction List. Goldman sees both Wal-Mart and the general retail environment as benefiting from recent federal tax changes.  And the retailer remains ""still very much in control of its own destiny,"" Goldman's note said, despite online disruptions to traditional retail business models.Wal-Mart shares remained in a buy range, above a 100.23 buy point in a second-stage flat base.Apple opened ahead 0.2%. The stock made its most decisive move to date above a 176.34 buy point Wednesday — a buy point it has been attempting to clear and hold since mid-December.  Shares received a boost after the company said it would make $38 billion in repatriation tax payments, implying plans to ship home its $252 billion in overseas cash.

That was down from a pace of 1.297 million starts in November, as well as forecasts for a more mild slowdown, to 1.280 million starts.Building permits, which gauge upcoming activity, rose to 1.302 million, on an annualized basis.

921,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS) said Wednesday it's evaluating whether to enter the cryptocurrency frenzy after fourth-quarter results beat forecasts despite continued weakness in its trading operations, which underperformed vs. other big banks.X Last month, when Bitcoin was double what it is today, Bloomberg reported that Goldman was setting up a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies.On Wednesday, CFO Martin Chavez did not say whether a trading operation was in the cards, but he warned is approaching the volatile market with ""extreme prudence and caution.""""There's just a huge number of topics to address,"" he told analysts. ""And being a part of the industry, we're working on all of that. Custody is a part of it, and it's a very complex one, so it's really too early to say how that will evolve for the industry or for ourselves.""At Bank of America (BAC), which also reported Wednesday, CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts that customers are welcome to buy cryptocurrencies but not through the bank's Merrill Lynch unit, adding ""it's just our view that customers should be careful here.""The caution follows warnings from the Treasury Department, which has said it is following cryptocurrencies closely due to their use in criminal activity, while Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said last week Bitcoin could become the next ""Swiss Bank account.""Meanwhile, Goldman's Q4 adjusted EPS unexpectedly rose, climbing 11.8% to $5.68, beating views for a dip to $4.90.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Wall Street has looked at what the banks expect to gain from the GOP's tax reform package. Bank of America, among the most U.S.-exposed big banks, could be among the bigger gainers from the legislation.Goldman's Chavez said the company expected an effective tax rate of 24% due to the tax reform, adding that there was greater potential for heightened M&A, more financing and stronger economic growth.The law, he said, had brought ""significant clarity"" to corporations, resulting in more dialog with clients in investment banking.Last week, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the company would deepen its investments in such areas as digital capabilities, offices and bankers. The company also said it expected tax reform to boost profits at small businesses and spending in the commercial space.CEO Jamie Dimon said that much of the benefit from tax reform would ""fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Fierce Bitcoin Critic Now Has 'Regret'; Kodak Joins Blockchain WaveEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

923,MS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats.

Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value.

UnitedHealth earnings rose 23% to $2.59 a share, beating views for $2.50, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today. That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday.

929,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results early Friday, while Wells Fargo (WFC) was mixed.X Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.69, down 1%, on revenue of $24.99 billion, up 7%.Results: JPMorgan earned $1.76 a share adjusted on revenue of $25.45 billion. That earnings figure excludes a $2.4 billion negative impact from the Trump tax cuts.  JPMorgan sees a 19% effective tax rate in 2018.Fixed income, credit and currency trading revenue tumbled 34% to $2.22 billion. Consumer and business banking revenue rose 16% to $5.6 billion. Commercial banking revenue grew 20% to $2.4 billion. Asset and wealth management revenue increased 9% to $3.4 billion.Stock: Shares of the Dow component climbed 1.65% to 112.67 on the stock market today. Shares were within range of a 108.50 buy point of a 3-weeks trading pattern. Breakouts from a 3-weeks-tight pattern are opportunities for existing investors to add a few more shares to their holdings.Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) added 1.7%. Both report next week.Estimates: EPS of $1.04, up 1%. Revenue is seen rising 4% to $22.427 billion.Results: EPS of $1.16 on revenue of $22.05 billion. Wells Fargo booked a $3.35 billion after-tax benefit on the tax plan and a $3.25 billion pretax charge for litigation expenses.

The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Analysts hadn't exactly been expecting blowout earnings from the banks this month, as many financial institutions absorb short-term, but heavy, hits to their profits due to the tax reform.Goldman Sachs (GS), has forecast a $5 billion dent to earnings, much of it due to the repatriation tax. Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America and Citigroup have said they would take big charges from writing down so-called deferred tax assets, which companies can use to ease their tax burden in the event of a loss.Still, tax reform is largely expected to benefit the banks longer term. Analysts have said the legislation would likely be a bigger theme this earnings season than the results themselves, as Wall Street tries to assess the full benefits of the bill.Financials also have been rallying in 2018 on higher bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury rate moving past 2.5% this week. Higher yields, including a wider spread between short- and long-term maturities, should bolster banks' profitability in traditional lending.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Blackrock Earnings Rise 21% As Assets Under Management SwellBanks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

930,MS,"""Messy and lackluster,"" Jefferies says. ""Isn't great,"" according to Nomura-Instinet. ""Noise,"" says Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Those are words being used to describe big banks' fourth-quarter earnings season, which starts Friday, with results due from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).The good news, perhaps, is that Wall Street might not care that much.X After a year dogged by lackluster trading activity, flattening yield curves and occasional concerns about loan growth, business confidence and long-term rates, the financial community seems likelier to be more interested in the longer-term benefits from the tax reform signed into law last month and trends for the year ahead.""While results may underwhelm some investors, we believe the bigger story for 4Q will be tax guidance,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Steven Chubak wrote in a research note last week, adding that management should offer more detail on future tax rates and more obscure parts of the tax bill.The more U.S.-exposed banks — such as Bank of America (BAC), which reports on Jan. 17, and JPMorgan — are likely to get the biggest bounce to earnings, he said.As for the fourth quarter: Trading? That'll be bad, again, compared to last year, when the markets' gears were still grinding away to process President Trump's election. Loan growth, particularly in commercial and industrial lending? Could be better, due to seasonal factors, KBW says. But one-time charges related to Trump's new tax legislation will soak the banks' profits during the quarter.JPMorgan is seen reporting earnings per share of $1.69, down 1%. Revenue is seen up 7% to $24.99 billion.Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO, has been a longtime evangelist for tax reform and deregulation. Over the summer, Dimon said it was ""almost an embarrassment, being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country.""Wells Fargo, which is also likely to be a big gainer from tax reform as it tries to repair its reputation after a fake-account scandal, is expected to report EPS up 1% to $1.04. Revenue is expected to come in at $22.43 billion, a 4% increase.PNC Financial (PNC), which also reports Friday, is seen growing EPS by 12% to $2.20, as revenue grows 8% to $4.17 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.As the industry looks out to the year ahead, analysts generally think 2018 will be a better year for the banks. But they remain mixed over where, and when, the benefits will land.Among the benefits to expect, Chubak cites rate hikes from the Fed — which would bump up rates on things like credit cards and auto loans, and healthier deal making amid more clarity over tax policy. But weak fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading could extend into this year.While business-loan growth might be stronger in Q4, it could be muted in the first half of the year, as ""companies are expected to slow borrowing until all the ramifications of the tax bill are sorted out,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote.Goldman Sachs (GS) reports Q4 results next Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) reports next Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Fierce Bitcoin Critic Now Has 'Regret'; Kodak Joins Blockchain WaveBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetMorgan Stanley To Take $1.25 Billion Hit For U.S. Tax RevampGoldman Sachs Takes One-Time $5 Billion Hit From U.S. Tax Bill

945,MS,"Rivals Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst forecasts. But while shares of Morgan Stanley glided higher on sturdier results across the board, Goldman tripped, with some analysts parsing the quality of the numbers beyond the headline figures.The results from the two banks follow weakness in the kind of trading that Goldman Sachs has built its reputation on, whereas Morgan Stanley's more conservative, stable wealth management business has gained strength. That business has put up higher returns as it draws in high-net-worth clients.""This business is very strong, and Goldman doesn't have this kind of business,"" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said.Wealth management helps to insulate Morgan Stanley from the whims of the market, and could help the bank deliver firmer earnings than Goldman further out, he said.Shares close up 0.4% at 49.12 on the stock market today, still within buy range of a 48.59 entry of a cup-with-handle base, putting Morgan Stanley's market cap at $90 billion, while Goldman fell 2.6% to 236.09, with its market cap now at $91 billion. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley briefly topped Goldman in valuation.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Nomura analyst Steven Chubak also said in a research note that much of the strength in Goldman's results came from ""lower-quality"" areas that are more volatile and more capital-intensive, such as fixed-income and investing and lending, where revenue jumped 35%.But without the jump in investing and lending and a lower tax rate, he said, earnings per share, which rose 3% to $5.02, wouldn't have beaten estimates by nearly as much. Analysts expected $4.31, according to Zacks Investment Research.The bank's equities and investment management divisions produced results that he characterized as somewhat disappointing. And Chubak said that despite Goldman's strength in lining up mergers and acquisitions during the quarter, lower backlogs in its investment banking division ""raise questions on the near-term sustainability of IB momentum.""Still, Goldman's top and bottom line both unexpectedly rose. Revenue increased 2% to $8.326 billion, beating forecasts for a decline to $7.638 billion.Goldman's investment banking revenue rose 17% to $1.8 billion. Equity revenue fell 7% to $1.67 billion. Investment management revenue rose 3% to $1.53 billion.Fixed income revenue for Goldman sank 26% to $1.45 billion. That compared to Morgan Stanley's 20% drop to $1.2 billion. Morgan, like others, cited a mix of lower volatility and muted activity during the quarter.But investors on Tuesday looked upon Morgan Stanley more favorably, and the bank continued its streak of solid trading results. Revenue in the bank's trading business fell 8% — but that was better than any other large bank during the quarter.Trading from JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) has been weaker this year, after Brexit and the surprise election President Trump upended markets last year.Morgan Stanley's fixed-income desk beat Goldman's in both this year's first and second quarters. That outperformance occurred despite Morgan's moves away from trading and toward wealth management in the years since the financial crisis.Morgan's results in Q3 proved to be solid elsewhere. Investment banking revenue grew to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion. Wealth management revenue grew to $4.2 billion from $3.9 billion. Sales and trading net revenue fell to $2.9 billion from $3.2 billion a year ago, with equity revenue flat at $1.9 billion.Earnings per share jumped 15% to 93 cents, beating views for 81 cents, while revenue picked up by 3% to $9.917 billion, topping estimates for $8.95 billion.""Our third quarter results reflected the stability our Wealth Management, Investment Banking and Investment Management businesses bring when our Sales and Trading business faces a subdued environment,"" said Chairman and CEO James Gorman in a statement. ""Our balanced business model and the consistent performance of our franchise enabled us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders.""RELATED:Strong Retail Banking Lifts BofA; Wells Fargo Revenue MissesJPMorgan Sees Nothing To Spark Trading As Wall St. Waits On Tax ReformBitcoin Hits Record; JPMorgan 'Open Minded' To Regulated Digital Cash
"
946,MS,"Celgene (CELG), a pioneer and leading player in blood cancer treatment, has become a biotech juggernaut thanks largely to a drug that proved key in fighting the tricky disease multiple myeloma.XIn multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells in bone marrow elude immune-system fighters with a one-two punch: By changing the way they look and act while producing immune-suppressing molecules. Enter Celgene's Revlimid.This so-called immune-modulating drug helps immune cells attack cancer cells and starve myeloma cells in bone marrow by preventing new blood vessels from forming. The drug might also become a big weapon against an equally dreaded disease, lymphoma.Drugs battling diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis also are on Celgene's potential hit list — an arsenal that earned the company recognition by Investor's Business Daily in the inaugural IBD Innovator Awards for biotech.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Revlimid will continue to dominate the company's revenue for now. Though multiple myeloma remains an incurable cancer, Revlimid has proved to extend survival rates.""That drug is going to do around $9 billion in sales next year, which makes it one of the biggest drugs in all of biotech,"" said analyst Michael Yee, managing director at investment house Jefferies. He has a buy rating on Celgene, with a price target of 160.Celgene estimates that its sales, led by Revlimid, could exceed more than $21 billion by 2020, up nearly 40% from its expected revenue this year of roughly $13 billion. Celgene notched sales of $11.2 billion last year.The company's stock soared from about 40 in 2013, the year Revlimid won FDA approval to treat relapsed mantle-cell lymphoma, to a then-record 140 in mid-2015, the year Revlimid gained approval for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. That high held until early September, and in early October Celgene stock touched a record high near 147.Early this year, the FDA approved Revlimid as a maintenance treatment for a subset of patients with multiple myeloma, those needing maintenance after a stem-cell transplant.With a market cap near $107 billion, Celgene ranks No. 2 among the 453 companies in IBD's biotech industry group, trailing only Amgen (AMGN).Celgene's growth started with its 1992 licensing of a controversial drug with a bad reputation: thalidomide, which two decades earlier had been linked to birth defects.In 1999, thalidomide was approved as an anti-infective to treat lesions in patients with leprosy. Scientists also started to look at the drug as a possible therapy for multiple myeloma.Meanwhile, Celgene's scientists worked to improve the efficacy and side effects of thalidomide for treating multiple myeloma.The result: Thalidomide was approved for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma in 2006, followed shortly by the approval of lenalidomide — an orally administered thalidomide analogue — under the trade name Revlimid, for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who received at least one prior therapy.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest companies can still produce big stock gains, but often without the volatility of smaller stocks. The IBD Big Cap 20, which has recently included Celgene, is the place to track the biggest recent movers among the big boys.Revlimid was first approved in late 2005 for a subset of patients with the rare blood cancer known as MDS.Celgene didn't stop innovating. Many of its drug candidates are small-molecule compounds also meant to modulate the immune system. These drugs target the sources of the disease rather than the symptoms.""They aren't just doing me-too drugs,"" Yee said.Celgene's executives like to say the company favors ""disruptive science.""As CEO Mark Alles explained to IBD: ""Celgene's core purpose is to apply unique scientific insights into the underlying source and mechanism of disease to provide new treatments for patients with significant medical needs.""Celgene spends nearly $3 billion annually in research and development. Drugs in its pipeline especially target blood cancers, solid tumors, and inflammatory and immune diseases.Its research portfolio includes 50 molecules supported by 100 different clinical programs, Alles pointed out at an investor conference this spring. Of those 50, 14 could be approved before 2021, with nine or 10 having multibillion-dollar blockbuster potential, he says.Alles also told IBD that Celgene partners with ""other promising innovators to enhance and accelerate the discovery of new medicines.""Many of its more than 30 partnerships are with small biotechs, including Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Acceleron Pharma (XLRN).In July, Celgene said it would collaborate with China-based BeiGene (BGNE) to develop and market an investigational protein inhibitor for patients with solid-tumor cancers.""Their business model is driven by internal R&D as well as 'distributed' research,"" Yee said, ""whereby they seek to license and acquire complementary products that are focused on novel mechanisms of action that try to treat the underlying cause of the disease.""Analysts say one of the most notable drugs in Celgene's internally developed war chest is the fast-growing Otezla, an autoimmune treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It is one of the company's four current blockbusters — drugs with annual sales of $1 billion-plus.Besides leader Revlimid, the other blockbusters are: Pomalyst, a second-generation version of Revlimid approved in 2013 for patients who didn't respond to other therapies; and Abraxane, used to treat breast cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.Celgene is also studying Otezla for potential use in ulcerative colitis and Behcet's disease.Among other new indications, Celgene hopes that Revlimid will prove effective in treating Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma is of ""equal or greater size"" than myeloma, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent research report.Following Celgene's better-than-expected second-quarter results, Porges raised his price target to 160 from 150. He rates the stock outperform, citing ""a number of pivotal trial results emerging this year and next.""New drugs are crucial. Celgene loses patent protection on Revlimid in 2027. Not a worry, says analyst Yee: ""They are finding new blockbuster drugs that will diversify the revenue base.""One potential blockbuster is ozanimod, which came by way of Celgene's $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos in 2015. The oral drug showed positive results in late-stage trials for relapsed multiple sclerosis.Celgene estimates that ozanimod could generate $2 billion to $3 billion in annual sales for treating MS and an equal amount for treating ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease could provide further revenue if clinical trials prove positive.Based on emerging data, ozanimod also has the potential to serve as ""an anchor for our neuro franchise in the future,"" Celgene President Scott Smith told analysts in the company's Q2 earnings call.Another closely watched potential blockbuster in late-stage trials is the oral compound GED-0301, for treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The development drug was licensed from privately held Nogra Pharma in 2014.A small-molecule drug known as AG-221, or Idhifa, which was licensed from Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), is the first approved product from Celgene's collaborations.In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved AG-221 for a subset of adult patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Most patients with AML eventually relapse and, of those, up to an estimated 20% have a mutation that AG-221 targets.Analyst Leah Cann of Oppenheimer estimates that drug, which she expects will hit the market in the fourth quarter, could garner $1.4 billion in annual sales in 2021.Meanwhile, the compound CC-220 is showing ""encouraging clinical data in lupus,"" Alles told analysts in July, noting that the autoimmune disease has a ""large and dramatically underserved patient population. … (W)e have some pretty exciting initial data.""And positive late-stage results for new indications in several immunology/oncology combination trials could breathe new life into one of Celgene's top-four drugs, Abraxane.Sales have been growing slowly of late, up just 2% in the second quarter, to $254 million. In contrast, Otezla's Q2 sales jumped 49% to $358 million.Celgene boasts many other drugs at early stages. One potential blockbuster, for example, could treat the aggressive cancerous brain tumor glioblastoma, recently diagnosed in Sen. John McCain. Celgene expects to start a pivotal trial this year with proteasome inhibitor marizomib, in combination with standard therapy.Celgene bought marizomib last year from privately held Triphase Accelerator.Whether internally developed or by way of partners, Celgene's therapies, said analyst Yee, ""are some of the most novel and innovative in biotech.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkCelgene Is Among Big Cap 20's Solid PerformersHow Celgene's Immuno-Oncology Effort Helped This Small Biotech StockA Look At A Recent Celgene Stock Breakout

947,MS,"The breakfasters at Bob and Edith's Diner are too preoccupied with their tasty bacon and eggs to notice the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. Or perhaps, like all Americans who are more sensitive than oysters, they are in the throes of political exhaustion and are trying to ignore this year's only competitive gubernatorial race.In any case, they seem unaware that the mild-mannered pediatric neurologist in one of the booths — he is wearing a bourgeois disguise: gray suit, maroon tie — supposedly is ""fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs"" involving many Central American immigrants. The U.S. president says so, as does the gubernatorial candidate of his party.In two weeks, Virginia will have America's most consequential election since 50 weeks ago. Then, this became the only Southern state Hillary Clinton carried (by 5 points). Today's campaign dramatizes the difficult calculation confronting people who want the Republican Party restored as a vehicle for conservatism but who know that this requires expunging the political style — exuberantly fact-free accusations and screeds — exemplified by the ""MS-13"" tweet.Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam won the Democratic nomination by handily defeating (by 10 points) a darling of the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren (both endorsed the darling) tendency in the Democratic primary, which attracted 177,000 more voters than the Republican primary did. Now, however, Northam is benefiting from his opponent's intractable dilemma, that of all Republicans who remember life before 2016 and want to do what they are told cannot be done: Turn the clock back. Virginia's incumbent Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, is popular. Virginia is purple trending blue: Democrats have carried it in three consecutive presidential races, they have won three of the last four gubernatorial contests and both U.S. senators are Democrats. Barack Obama has campaigned to energize African-American voters. And the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, has a problem residing across the Potomac.In 2014, Gillespie — former counselor to President George W. Bush, former Republican National Committee chair, advisor to Mitt Romney's campaign, lobbyist extraordinaire — came within a whisker (under 18,000 votes) of defeating an incumbent U.S. senator, Mark Warner. This year, however, Gillespie barely defeated a full-throated Trumpian in the Republican primary. Gillespie is intelligent, temperate, experienced and happiest when talking about government policies. These attributes are, in the incandescent eyes of his party's now-Trumpian base, defects of swamp creatures. So, he is gingerly tiptoeing across the treacherous terrain of Trumpian Republican politics. This involves stoking the anger of those people who seem happiest when furious, but without infuriating everyone else.He did the former with dishonest MS-13 ads featuring tattooed dark-skinned men (""Kill, rape, control."") and accusing Northam of refusing to crack down on ""sanctuary cities,"" of which Virginia has none. Gillespie's admirers say he is better than he sounds. Others, remembering Mark Twain (who popularized the quip ""Wagner's music is better than it sounds""), say that in democratic politics — the politics of persuasive rhetoric — a candidate is the way he chooses to sound.Recently, however, Gillespie has been stressing economic issues while Northam has been saturating liberal Northern Virginia with ads featuring women who are cross because Gillespie is pro-life. Never mind that governors have been almost irrelevant to abortion policy since courts took control of it two generations ago. Perhaps Northam's ads are intended to enkindle progressives, but that should be done by the president's daily reminders of his existence. If Gillespie enlists Trump to campaign for him, he will thereby embrace a political style that entails a political substance (e.g., harping on MS-13) suited to it. If he does not, Trump's supporters will notice and accuse him of having standards, yet another swampish vice — the stigmata of elitism.A Gillespie win on Nov. 7 would be a double victory for Republicans. They would control another swing-state's governor's mansion in 2020. And it might send the Sanders/Warren true believers careening off on a ""We told you so!"" rampage, arguing — convincingly only to other believers — that Virginians chose a conservative Republican because Northam, although progressive, was insufficiently so. Then they could continue making ""single-payer"" (government-dispensed) health care progressivism's central promise to a nation in which 157 million people happily get their health care plans from their employers.So, if Gillespie wins, Republicans elsewhere will conclude that the derangement of their party does not hinder its prospering. If the Democrat wins, many progressives will be secretly as unhappy as the Trumpians who, like those progressives, will argue that their man lost because he was inconsistently and insincerely enthusiastic about his party's most off-putting faction.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

948,MS,"Let's look at two pictures side by side and see if we can tell how they're different. In one panel, we see a famous TV political analyst who apparently had the charming habit of pressing his erect, if clothed, penis against the bodies of young women who worked with and for him. That was Mark Halperin.In the second panel, we have former President George H.W. Bush, in a wheelchair, age 89, posing for a photo with a number of others, including his wife Barbara, and an actress called Heather Lind. Lind says she felt moved to share her trauma after seeing the benefit concert for Hurricane Harvey relief in which five former presidents participated. It seems that people are unaware of President Bush's criminal record:""When I got the chance to meet George H.W. Bush four years ago to promote a historical television show I was working on, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.""He didn't shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke.""And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again. Barbara rolled her eyes as if to say 'not again.'""Fortunately, Lind immediately related the outrage to her ""fellow cast-mates and producers"": ""(They) helped me that day and continue to support me. I am grateful for the bravery of other women who have spoken up and written about their experiences.""Ah, yes, the brave women who stand up to sweet, 90-something guys with a form of Parkinson's. The brave women who put those completely honorable, polite and respectful guys who were war heroes and served their country in their place.Sorry, Ms. Lind, you're not brave. You're a twit. At the very worst, Bush did something tasteless. As you admit, the cameras were rolling the whole time. How awful can it have been? He's very old. People's judgment declines, especially if they're unwell. But you've made a fool of yourself for equating a pat on the tush from someone who couldn't possibly do you any harm to ""sexual assault."" You are either hysterical or cynical. I'm guessing the latter. You figured you'd jump on today's bandwagon and grab your moment in the spotlight. Instead, you've embarrassed yourself.What must the women Halperin targeted think when they compare their situations with Lind's? A woman who had worked with Halperin in 2004, when he was political director of ABC News, described a meeting in his office:""The first meeting I ever had with him was in his office, and he just came up from behind — I was sitting in a chair from across his desk — and he came up behind me and (while he was clothed) he pressed his body on mine, his penis, on my shoulder. I was obviously completely shocked. I can't even remember how I got out of there — (but) I got out of there and was freaked out by that whole experience. Given I was so young and new I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news.""There are several reasons to take the story about Halperin seriously — as MSNBC clearly does in announcing his temporary departure from the network. One is that five women have offered very similar stories. Another is that Halperin, while quibbling over details, does not really deny the allegations.""During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me. I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.""Sorry, Mr. Halperin. You don't ""pursue relationships"" by grabbing women and pressing yourself on them. As much of a turn-on as it may be for you, it's a violation for them. You ""now understand""? No. You always understood. Of course you did. You know that everyone deserves respect, and that women in particular should never have their dignity compromised in the way you apparently compromised theirs.What Halperin is accused of, if true, is squalid. The story about Bush, though, demonstrates how common sense flies out the window once the pack is in full cry.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

949,MS,"The competition to succeed Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair is reportedly down to current Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford economist John Taylor, with Yellen herself now out of the running.XPowell is seen as a safer pick, because he's likely to stay on the same accommodative monetary policy course charted by Yellen that's been bullish for the stock market.President Trump, whose real estate background has made him a fan of low interest rates, is expected to make a decision soon.Taylor is more of a wild card. He believes in a rules-based approach to monetary policy, rather than one based on intuition, and created the Taylor Rule that implies the Fed's key lending rate should be higher than it is now — perhaps close to 2 percentage points higher.But Taylor expressed more flexibility in a recent speech, saying that rules are important, but central bankers ""can deviate from those rules as long as they explain why,"" Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, told IBD.There's not much doubt about whom bond investors want to get the job. ""The market sold off on headlines that President Trump had been 'impressed' after a meeting with John Taylor and subsequently rallied on stories that he was leaning towards tapping Fed Governor Jay Powell,"" wrote Jefferies economists in a wrap-up of last week's developments.The 10-year Treasury yield was little changed on Thursday after closing at a seven-month high of 2.44% on Wednesday. The rise in rates has come amid evidence of solid global growth, a booming stock market and the Fed's initial move to start unwinding the trillions in asset purchases it made to buoy the economy after the financial crisis. Still, some market participants have pointed to the changing of the guard at the Fed as an important contributor to the uptick in Treasury yields.Whatever the cause, the higher long-term yields have been good news for bank net interest margins and bank stocks. On Thursday, shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) advanced 0.7% to 55.62, closing in on a 56.70 buy point from a double-bottom base. A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best chance of securing near-term gains.Among other major banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 0.7%, Bank of America (BAC) 0.4%, Goldman Sachs (GS) 1 cent, and Morgan Stanley (MS) 0.4% on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase is at all-time highs, while Bank of America is at a nine-year best; both are extended from recent breakouts. Morgan Stanley is at the edge of a buy range, while Goldman Sachs is near a cup-with-handle entry.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Tuesday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. While even Yellen had opened the door to some softening of the tighter banking regulations put in place after the crisis, Powell and Taylor would likely be somewhat more amenable to deregulation, one of Trump's priorities.Prediction markets see Powell as the clear favorite, with about 60% odds of being appointed vs. about 20% for Taylor.Taylor criticized the Yellen Fed for waiting until December 2015 to begin raising interest rates, saying that low rates discouraged lending, adversely affected savers and contributed to slow economic growth.Bandholz expects that the initial market reaction will be less favorable if Taylor is appointed, but there's reason to think the difference might be just short-term. Fed Chairman Taylor would likely be more pragmatic than Professor Taylor, Bandholz said.RELATED:The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltECB Will Slow Asset Buys But Draghi Remains Cautious5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumFlood Warning: Federal Reserve, Treasury Both Set To Unload DebtStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

950,MS,"Cure is a strong word when it comes to treating cancer and other deadly diseases, but Brad Loncar is among the biotech stock analysts and investors ready to employ the term.X""For the first time, biotech companies are not thinking about these technologies incrementally,"" said Loncar, portfolio manager of a biotech-focused ETF. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of the disease, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""Loncar was speaking of cancer, but those comments could apply to other terrible diseases that claim thousands of lives, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.Thirty-five years after the first FDA-approved biotech drug, the biotech industry is rolling out innovations at a breakneck pace. The new-drug pipeline is bursting with treatments in clinical trials, the industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and many biotech stocks are scoring superior returns for investors.To recognize the biotechnology industry's contributions to science and to patients' health, Investor's Business Daily has created the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards. In this inaugural edition, we name six award-winning U.S. biotech companies, chosen for their groundbreaking treatments recently introduced to the market or well along in the new-product pipeline.The six companies are Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Kite Pharma, Incyte (INCY) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO). The winners aren't ranked in any way; only companies with U.S.-traded shares were considered.All but Biogen have their sights firmly on curing cancer, among other intractable diseases. Biogen is targeting the likes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and MS.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)The six companies are just a few of the players in a huge field closely tracked by investors. IBD counts 453 publicly traded companies in its biotech industry group, which doesn't include the many other companies with biotech operations that aren't their main focus. The 453 have a combined market cap of nearly $900 billion and sales for the most recent 12 months of more than $100 billion.Thanks to the biotech industry, the pipeline of new drugs of all kinds has exploded. Clinicaltrials.org counts more than 1,480 drugs filed for Phase 3, or late-stage, trials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year, and the FDA has more than 32,000 late-stage studies registered.IBD's biotech industry stock group has climbed 33% this year, shucking off the pains of the politically charged election season in 2016 and concerns that President Trump will work to lower drug prices. The group on Wednesday hit a 22-month high of 3,128 but is down from its all-time high near 3,900 in July 2015. It currently ranks No. 1 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD in terms of performance in the past six months.Boosting the group's performance are Celgene and Loxo, which recently hit new highs. Incyte touched a record high this year, while Biogen touched a 27-month high on Friday and Regeneron this year touched a nearly two-year high.The biotech-focused fund that Brad Loncar heads up is Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), which tracks 30 biotechs working in immunotherapy. The exchange traded fund is nearing its two-year anniversary and is up 26% this year. His comments to IBD came amid a series of regulatory approvals and acquisitions in cancer treatment, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) foray into cellular therapy with its August agreement to acquire Kite for nearly $12 billion. (The Kite purchase was completed Oct. 3 and Kite now operates as a wholly owned Gilead unit.)Count Loncar among the bullish. Today, drugs can teach the immune system to identify, fight and precisely target cancerous cells. Technology can turn off or edit genes to correct genetic conditions.Some trial data are ""jaw-dropping,"" he said. One example is CAR-T technology, in which Kite is among the leaders. The field is young, but biotech companies ""are taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are seeing complete remissions,"" Loncar said. ""I've never seen anything like that.""Loncar likens chemotherapy to a bomb — it kills the enemy and everything else in sight. Loxo is using smart bombs. Its precision medicine targets gene fusions in cancer, JMP Securities analyst Mike King explains.In cancer, some genes are called passengers and others drivers, King told IBD. When a driver becomes fused to a normal cell, that normal cell transforms into a cancerous one. Loxo identifies and targets those fusions.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in June, Loxo showed the impact of its work with a photo of a sarcoma protruding from a child's chest, King says. By targeting what's called the TRK fusion, Loxo was able to treat the cancer.The tumor ""shrunk away to nothing without surgery or radiation or any other therapy contributing to it,"" he said. ""It was remarkable. It was pretty staggering even for people in the audience who are kind of used to seeing these kind of things.""Among 50 patients, the drug dubbed larotrectinib was able to partly shrink tumors in 64% of them, with all signs of cancer disappearing in 12% of patients. The drug has breakthrough, rare pediatric disease and orphan drug designations with the FDA.Also grabbing headlines is immuno-oncology work from Dow component Merck (MRK) as well as Incyte, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Besides Kite, CAR-T therapy is getting its due from the likes of Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).Immuno-oncology and CAR-T are both methods of teaching the immune system to fight cancer. Immuno-oncology drugs do so by blocking specific interactions that would otherwise prevent an immune response. CAR-T drugs individualize that process by reprogramming a patient's own extracted immune cells.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugs are snagging major attention after Gilead announced its plan to acquire Kite and Novartis got a major drug approval, opening up the sector for commercialization. Head to the IBD's Industry Snapshot feature for a closer look at the emerging CAR-T sector.Results have impressed, and immuno-oncology drugmakers are taking it a step further by combining their compounds in the hopes of seeing more robust responses. Merck has had success with its drug Keytruda, which has won approval as a first treatment with chemo in lung cancer.Incyte drug epacadostat is particularly intriguing, analysts say. It prevents some interactions involving the IDO enzyme. Merck and Bristol are pairing their drugs Keytruda and Opdivo — both belong to a class of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors — with Incyte's epacadostat.Regeneron, too, is working on a PD-1 inhibitor, with its REGN2810. It's developing this in partnership with Sanofi (SNY). In June, Regeneron and Sanofi said 46.2% of patients with a form of skin cancer responded to treatment with REGN2810 in a Phase 1 trial.On the CAR-T side, Novartis gained FDA approval in late August for a drug to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Its approval helped spike Gilead, which just two days before had announced its deal to acquire Kite.Kite is nearing approval for a CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Juno is just behind with its drug called JCAR017, which would treat the same cancer as Kite's drug. Bluebird is working on a multiple myeloma drug.Juno and Bluebird both have partnered with Celgene on their programs. JMP's King calls it a ""best-in-breed"" approach, where Celgene will put its money on the line for potential innovation.Such partnerships are where Celgene excels, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten told IBD.  ""They've had these innovative deals across sectors, from small molecules to cell therapy,"" he said. ""They're innovative, and they cast the net widely for new technologies and potential therapies.""Others are reaping the benefits of a decades-old project that mapped the human genome. The first human genome map cost $2.7 billion in 1997 dollars and took almost 15 years to complete. Today, it costs closer to $1,000 to map an individual's entire genetic makeup.Gene therapies and editing are having a ""renaissance,"" JMP's King said. Analysts point to Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), which made its IPO a year ago, as a leader in this field.Crispr is also the name of the technology. Crispr Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) also are making waves in the sector. The technology makes it much easier to edit genes, Needham analyst Alan Carr told IBD.BTIG analyst Dane Leone sees some of those companies entering the clinic in 2018.""This technology uses an enzyme that is actually from a bacterial organism to target areas of the genome or your DNA, where you want to make changes to the DNA,"" he said. ""What you can do using this enzyme complex is give it direction in terms of target, and insert it into a cell.""In the end, the enzyme complex attaches to DNA, where it can make alterations, he told IBD.JMP analyst King described Crispr technology as having the ability to ""repair broken genes, cut out and replace defective genes and insert functional genes where they're desired.""On the other side of the gene spectrum, RNA interference and antisense are responsible for cutting-edge drugs from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Biogen partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Biogen and Ionis in December won FDA approval for Spinraza, the first drug of its type approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy.Needham's Carr likened RNA interference as a way of ""turning off"" a gene. This has the potential to be more robust than gene therapy, which must alter all or most of the cells in the body to be effective.In September, Alnylam stock spiked 52% in one day after its drug, patisiran, proved effective in treating a rare disease known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The disease results in the buildup of abnormal protein causing systemic problems. Patisiran uses RNA interference. Analysts call the late-stage data from Alnylam a ""big win"" for the concept.Bluebird is working in gene therapy to treat blood disorders.The list of innovations goes on and on in this era of biotech, but today's gains have been decades in the making.""It's usually a steady build and then you have these waves of innovation that kind of collide or emerge at similar points in time,"" JMP's King said. ""It's not like the traditional tech, where things can happen overnight.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy PointHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealThe Cure For Cancer?

951,MS,"Bitcoin jumped 10% to a record high on Thursday, breaking through the $5,000 barrier, while a top JPMorgan Chase (JPM) executive signaled openness to cryptocurrencies despite a hard line on Bitcoin from CEO Jamie Dimon.X The price of the digital currency stood at $5,313.67 in late-afternoon, according to CoinDesk. Just a few weeks ago, it was hovering around $3,000 amid regulatory crackdowns in China and South Korea, along with mixed assessments from some top U.S. financial executives.While Dimon has called bitcoin ""a fraud,"" JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake on Thursday said the bank remained ""very open-minded"" to digital currencies that were properly regulated.Her remarks came during the bank's Q3 earnings call with reporters, in response to a question about whether other financial firms' potential advances into digital currencies were a mistake.Dimon, on that call, appeared uninterested in offering any more extended riffs on Bitcoin's fate. Other Wall Street chiefs have been more flexible lately.Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman said at a Wall Street Journal event last month that digital currencies were ""more than just a fad,"" according to CNBC. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted last week that he had yet to come to a conclusion on the currency.""Still thinking about #Bitcoin,"" he said. ""No conclusion — not endorsing/rejecting. Know that folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.""The Wall Street Journal also reported this month that Goldman Sachs was considering whether to develop a Bitcoin trading operation of some kind.IBD'S TAKE: Even as some economists and executives digest what Bitcoin means, the man known as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" has fewer doubts.JPMorgan closed down 0.9% at 95.99 in the stock market today, still within range of a 95.32 buy point of a flat base, after reporting Q3 results. Goldman eased 1.1%, while Morgan Stanley lost 1.2%, finishing right on its 48.59 entry from a cup-with-handle base.Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), whose graphics cards are often used to process digital-currency transactions, rose 0.1% and 2.3%, respectively.RELATED:JPMorgan, Citigroup Beat Q3 Estimates Despite Weak TradingCould Goldman Sachs Be The First Bank To Offer Bitcoin Trades?JPMorgan CEO Has Another Reason Why He Thinks Bitcoin Is Doomed

952,MS,"Biogen (BIIB), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) toppled early Tuesday, despite beating analyst expectations in third quarter, as Biogen faced pressure in its multiple sclerosis unit and Novartis delayed a strategic decision regarding its Alcon eye unit.XLilly closed Monday in buy range, while Novartis was just below a breakout. Biogen, meanwhile, fell out of buy territory Tuesday and dropped below its 50-day moving average.Biogen slid 3.9% to close at 315.73, despite beating top- and bottom-line expectations, after its spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza failed to meet expectations for U.S. sales. Biogen's partner, Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), also tumbled hard, falling 11% to 55.85 in recent action.Domestic sales of Spinraza came in light at $198 million, lagging RBC analyst Brian Abrahams' view for $221 million.Worldwide, however, Spinraza sales came in at $271 million, up 34%, and beating most analyst views between $240 million and $244 million, according to analysts with Leerink and Instinet.""Biogen disclosed that there was a 75% increase of the number of Spinraza patients in Q3 as compared to Q2, and the ex-U.S. launch is surpassing the initial U.S. trajectory,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. ""In the U.S., 80%-85% of all commercial and Medicaid lives now have access to Spinraza.""Further complicating Biogen's results were that sales its core multiple sclerosis unit trailed views by 1%, led by drug Tysabri, Porges said. Tysabri declined 9% to $469 million, 2% below the consensus.MS drug sales, excluding interferon, fell nearly 2% to $2.24 billion. Its top seller, Tecfidera, had a yearly sales gain to $1.07 billion, just below the consensus view at $1.08 billion, RBC's Abrahams said.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump could enact an executive order to tug down on drug prices ""any day,"" a Washington, D.C.-based expert said recently. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what that could mean for the biotech and drug industry.Overall, Biogen earned $6.31 a share, up nearly 22%, as revenue rose north of 4% to $3.08 billion. Excluding its hemophilia business, which Biogen spun off in February into Bioverativ (BIVV), sales grew 13% year over year, the company said.Analysts had called for Biogen to report $3.04 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $5.70 per share.Lilly fell 2.3% to finish at 85.17 on the stock market today, after announcing its plan to potentially spin off, sell or file an initial public offering for its Elanco Animal Health unit. A decision is expected by mid-2018.Lilly reported adjusted income of $1.05 per share on sales of $5.66 billion, up a respective 19% and 9% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of $1.03 a share on $5.51 billion in sales.""The sales beat came from Humalog, new products Basaglar and Jardiance, and the animal health unit offset by a slight miss on Trulicity vs. our expectations and loss of exclusivity of Effient,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients.Revenue from diabetes drug Humalog rose 9% to $696.2 million. Sales of fellow diabetes drugs Basaglar and Jardiance increased by triple-digit percentages to $145.7 million and $127.2 million, respectively. Taltz, a plaque psoriasis drug, grew to $151.3 million.Sales of diabetes drug Trulicity posted a yearly gain of 117% to $527.7 million, but that missed some views.The firm also raised the midpoint of its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by 5 cents to $4.15-$4.25, which would rise 18%-21% on a year-over-year basis.Lilly expects to make a decision regarding an initial public offering, merger, sale or retention of its animal health unit, Elanco Animal Health, by the middle of 2018. Sales in that unit rose 5% to $740.6 million.Novartis shares slacked 3.2% to close at 83.13 though the drugmaker beat third-quarter expectations, after it delayed a strategic decision regarding its Alcon eye unit until 2019, saying it wants to beef up the division first.For the quarter, Novartis reported revenue of $12.41 billion on earnings of $1.29 a share vs. the year-earlier period in which the drugmaker posted $1.23 earnings per share on $12.13 billion in sales. Analysts had seen $1.25 and $12.17 billion, respectively, for the Swiss drug giant.Cosentyx — approved to treat plaque psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and a rare form of arthritis known as Ankylosing Spondylitis — brought in $556 million in sales, beating the consensus by $17 million, Leerink's Fernandez said in another note to clients.But ""Entresto continues its linear but disappointing growth trajectory with $128 million in sales (vs. our estimate of $155 million and consensus of $141 million),"" Fernandez said. Entresto is approved to treat patients with chronic heart failure.All three of Novartis' business units were above expectations, Fernandez said. Its Sandoz segment surprised at $2.6 billion and Alcon delivered a ""critically strong performance,"" growing 7% on a constant-currency basis to $1.5 billion.RELATED:How Allergan's 'Public Relations Backlash' Deepened This WeekBiogen's Biomarkers Mark Way To Alzheimer's, Parkinson's TreatmentsDoes Gilead Now Have A New Multi-Billion-Dollar Franchise?

957,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) continues to drive innovation in neuroscience, using biomarkers, biological mechanisms and other cutting-edge technologies to develop therapies to fight some of the toughest-to-treat diseases, including MS, ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.X""They are fearless in terms of trying new approaches to gene therapy and gene correction as well as biological therapeutics in areas where small molecules have been the norm,"" Stifel analyst Tom Shrader told IBD.Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt also is a fan. ""From where we sit on Wall Street, everyone appreciates that Biogen is very good at understanding the basic science and underlying biology behind neurological diseases,"" Schmidt told IBD. ""They have been doing it for a long time and have good basic research.""In order to innovate you need that solid foundation in that space.""Such high praise earned Biogen recognition as an IBD Biotech Innovators award winner and a future observers call bright.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Biogen, which on Friday touched a 27-month high of 338.94 (closing at 337.89) and carries a very high IBD Composite Rating of 96, already has built the leading portfolio of treatments for multiple sclerosis with innovative drugs such as Tecfidera.  In 2013, Tecfidera brought to a wide range of MS patients a combination of efficacy, safety, tolerability and ease of administration not seen before in an MS drug.Tecfidera still leads the MS market, with 38% market share worldwide, according to Biogen.The biotech pioneer also has a groundbreaker in Spinraza, the only approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.  SMA, the No. 1  genetic cause of death in infants, is marked by progressive and debilitating muscle weakness.In addition, Biogen could have a pioneer treatment with its drug aducanumab, being developed to treat early Alzheimer's disease.""Should aducanumab work, it would be the first therapy to show a disease-modifying effect in Alzheimer's,"" analyst Schmidt said.The ""modifying effect"" has to do with the way aducanumab works. The memory loss and functional decline in Alzheimer's is linked to amyloid plaques, which are abnormal deposits that build up in the brain.IBD'S TAKE: Wouldn't it be nice to know when stocks are rising such that they are near good prices to buy, as biotech stocks were in a June run-up? IBD makes this research easier with its weekly Stocks Near A Buy Zone overview.That's where aducanumab, an antibody that ""binds"" to amyloid plaque in the brain, comes in: ""Based on preclinical and Phase 1B trial data to date, treatment with aducanumab has been shown to reduce amyloid plaque levels,"" the company said in August, in an analysis of its ongoing trial.""These early studies of aducanumab show its effectiveness in removing amyloid plaque from the brain as well as its potential effect on the slowing of cognitive decline in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease,"" Alfred Sandrock, the company's chief medical officer, said at the time.Biogen's approach to developing aducanumab is innovative, analysts say.""It used imaging to enrich the population of patients in the (Phase 1B) trial with those the drug was most likely to help,"" analyst Shrader explained.The company acknowledges, however, that any final approvals for aducanumab are still ""years away.""For now, Spinraza is Biogen's big growth driver.""Based on Spinraza's tremendous growth outlook, Biogen's financial outlook for the next couple of years should be good,"" Schmidt said.But he also says new drugs will have to pan out at some point.""Once Spinraza's trajectory begins to flatten, it remains to be seen whether anything in the company's pipeline is capable of driving growth,"" Schmidt said.Biogen has licenses with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) that give Biogen the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Spinraza.Last December, Spinraza was approved in the U.S. with a full drug label, meaning the drug can treat anyone with SMA. It is also approved in the European Union, Switzerland, Japan, Canada and Brazil.Shrader says Spinraza was developed using ""an unbelievably innovative approach — changing the expression of genes in the patient.""Genes encode proteins, and proteins ""dictate"" cell function. The genes ""expressed"" in a particular cell determine what the cell can do.Spinraza is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). It uses Ionis' proprietary antisense technology designed to treat SMA caused by ""mutations or deletions"" in the SMN1 gene, which lead to SMN protein deficiency, says Biogen.Through the use of ASO technology, Spinraza has the potential to increase the amount of ""full-length"" SMN protein in individuals with SMA and regulate gene expression, Biogen says.As analyst Shrader explained: ""Changing the expression of genes means patients start to express a good copy of the protein SMN to replace the expression of a bad copy of the SMN gene.""Kenneth Hobby, president of advocacy organization Cure SMA, calls Spinraza a lifesaver.""Spinraza is a very powerful drug,"" Hobby told IBD. ""It is a very accurate genetic-based technology that goes to correcting the cause of the disease.""People are living with the disease now, when they would have passed away at 2 years old. They're breathing and eating, and some are even walking.""Hobby says Biogen and Ionis used an innovative approach to design their clinical trials.""They worked with the patient community very early on in the process to help design the clinical trials to get critical information on what benefits to measure in the trials,"" Hobby said.  ""They were open in communicating results and information.""This approach of being honest and open with sharing information and goals is what ultimately gave a bigger and better result, which was the data needed to get early approval and a full drug label for all patients from the FDA.""Analysts expect Spinraza will be Biogen's next blockbuster — a drug with annual sales over $1 billion — following its MS drugs. Tecfidera had $3.96 billion in 2016 sales, Avonex $2.31 billion and Tysabri $1.96 billion.Analyst Schmidt says Spinraza could hit $3 billion to $4 billion in annual sales but cautions ""it's still early days.""He estimates Spinraza's sales will hit $1.25 billion in 2018, up from $875 million this year, and peak in five to eight years.Aducanumab also is a potential blockbuster. Stifel's Shrader estimates its yearly sales at $2 billion to as much as $12 billion, ""depending on the actual fraction of patients it helps and the final side effects.""Cowen's Schmidt says Wall Street's biggest hopes among Biogen's pipeline candidates rest on aducanumab. ""Many of us think it would be a terrific drug,"" he said.Biogen would not make an executive available to comment for this story, but its media staff said remarks made by Biogen R&D chief Michael Ehlers on the company's Q2 earnings conference call offer insight into Biogen's approach.On that July call, Ehlers said Biogen concentrates on four core growth areas:  MS and neuroimmunology, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, Parkinson's disease and related movement disorders, and neuromuscular disease including SMA and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease).Ehlers said Biogen is succeeding in understanding the basic biological mechanism or disease process of these diseases and developing therapies that target these mechanisms and processes.Biogen is gaining a better understanding of genetics and ""mechanisms of action,"" he said.""We are developing insights from longitudinal studies of populations,"" he said on the call. ""For example, we are mining our clinical data and experimental electrophysiological endpoints in ALS, yielding clinical measures with the potential to enable trials that are half the size, twice the speed, and a third the cost.""Biogen continues to invest heavily in ""biomarkers"" (specific physical traits) for disease pathology and progression,  said Ehlers.""In Parkinson's disease, our advanced imaging biomarker investments are allowing patient selection and detection of disease progression that has not previously been possible,"" he said.  ""We have identified genetic modifiers and causal pathways that are providing proprietary insight to produce our next generation of drug candidates.""Analyst Shrader says Biogen uses imaging to understand when neurological drugs are working, saying development of aducanumab depended on its innovative use of imaging.Biogen licensed aducanumab from Switzerland-based biotech Neurimmune.In the ongoing Phase 1B trial, researchers found in brain scans that aducanumab reduced the levels of the protein amyloid beta, which is thought to be toxic to brain cells.Research shows that amyloid begins to build up in the brain 10 to 20 years before Alzheimer's symptoms appear, James Hendrix, director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association advocacy organization, told IBD.""The clinical design of Biogen's Phase 1B trial was innovative,"" Hendrix said. ""One hypothesis of why so many Alzheimer's drugs have negative results in late-stage clinical trials is they were given to people who had already progressed to Alzheimer's dementia and were therefore very sick.""That wasn't the case in Biogen's Phase 1B trial. The patients included in the trial had early Alzheimer's or early memory problems, with high levels of the amyloid protein in their brain based on an amyloid PET scan.""Biogen's strategy is to treat the disease early or before the memory and thinking symptoms appear,"" said Hendrix. ""How do you find these people?  The answer for Biogen is to use brain amyloid PET imaging.""To determine who should be in the trial, Biogen used amyloid PET imaging as a ""screening tool,"" Hendrix said.""Using amyloid PET scans in this way has ensured that everybody in the Biogen trial had high levels of amyloid in their brain,"" he said. ""After one year, the study showed that the drug did what it was supposed to do, which was remove amyloid from the brain.""That is, to my knowledge, the first time a trial like this has ever been done.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkBiogen And Others Are Making Inroads Vs.

958,MS,"The major market indexes edged lower in early morning trade Friday. According to the Labor Department, the U.S. economy lost 33,000 jobs in September, partly due to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.2%.XVolume in the stock market today was down on the NYSE but up on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Monday.Dow component UnitedHealth gapped up 5%, topping the Street's estimate on earnings. The nation's largest health insurance company has exited most of the ObamaCare markets. The exits chopped $1.6 billion off revenue.UnitedHealth's stock retook its 50-day line as shares hit a new high. The megacap stock has been consolidating since early September. Tuesday's move could be seen as a breakout from a flat pattern.In the Nasdaq 100, biotech stock Biogen (BIIB) advanced 3% despite noise from President Trump on drug prices. In a press conference, the president said ""the world is taking advantage of us."" Trumped vowed to reduce prices, which he said are ""out of control.""In the small-cap S&P 600, Servis1st Bank (SFBS) jumped 4% in busy volume. The Alabama-based bank is thinly traded.

960,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS) is reportedly considering developing a cryptocurrency trading operation, a move that would come as more investors seek exposure to forms of digital money like Bitcoin even as it meets resistance from regulators, economists and finance-industry executives.XAs described by the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the situation, Goldman is in the early phases of the initiative, which could involve the bank's strategic investment and currency-trading segments. The efforts might not materialize, the Journal said.But the involvement of currency-trading and strategic investment divisions, the Journal added, indicates that Goldman ""believes Bitcoin's future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.""That future would differ dramatically from the one predicted by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon in recent weeks has said Bitcoin ""will end badly"" and would likely be relegated to the black market, arguing governments would be unwilling to tolerate a currency that operates outside of regulatory boundaries. He also said he'd fire anyone at JPMorgan caught trading Bitcoin.While banks have been more open to blockchain, the record-keeping technology that underpins Bitcoin transactions, a trading platform on a large U.S. bank would mark the biggest embrace yet of digital currencies. Bitcoin was up 2.1% to $4,415.95 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: As cryptocurrencies grow, they've become tougher to ignore by the financial industry's old guard. Here's what some Wall Street giants are doing in the digital currency space.Elsewhere in the financial world, Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman told the Journal last month that the Bitcoin market was ""obviously highly speculative, but it's not something that's inherently bad.""CBOE Holdings (CBOE) has said it plans to introduce Bitcoin futures. Fidelity Investments is testing out a project that makes data on consumer digital cash holdings available on Fidelity.com. Exchange-traded-fund giant ProShares has asked the SEC to approve to Bitcoin ETFs, while the regulator earlier in the year rejected one proposed by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.Regulators in some nations have been concerned about security risks and scams. China has banned initial coin offerings and has ordered cryptocurrency exchanges in the nation to stop trading. South Korea has also said it would ban ICOs, and the SEC has said securities law may apply to such offerings.Bitcoin's price has swung wildly on the crackdown in China and the comments from Dimon and others. Some analysts say the digital's price volatility will ease as the market for it grows.Banks in recent months have struggled with low market volatility, hurting results from their trading desks. Goldman has said that it has misplayed the market in its trading division.Goldman Sachs rose 1.5% to 240.65 in the stock market today, hitting its best level since late March as it builds the right side of a base. Morgan Stanley advanced 1.6% to 48.92, moving just above a shallow cup-with-handle base with a 48.59 buy point. JPMorgan climbed 1.4% to 96.84, still within buy range of a flat base with a 95.32 buy point.RELATED:South Korea Becomes Latest Nation To Ban Initial Coin OfferingsJPMorgan CEO Has Another Reason Why He Thinks Bitcoin Is DoomedBank Of America, JPMorgan Lead 5 Banks Hitting Buys As GOP Tax Plan Boosts YieldsCitigroup Warns On Trading But Bank Stocks Rally On Rising Yields

The price of crude oil backed more than 2%, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate holding above $50 per barrel.Casino stocks were generally down in the stock market today after Sunday night's Las Vegas shooting, with shares of MGM Resorts (MGM) falling the most, down more than 3%. The stock had been consolidating at its 50-day line after a brief breakout above a 34.63 cup-shaped base entry several weeks ago.

962,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) hovered near buy points on Thursday following the Federal Reserve decision to begin paring its massive bond holdings and sticking to a hawkish forecast for raising interest rates. JPMorgan and PNC moved into buy zones intraday, briefly joining Citigroup (C).XJPMorgan rose 0.45% to 95.03 in the stock market today. Intraday shares rose as high as 95.37, briefly clearing a 95.32 flat base buy point. Volume was light.Bank of America, whose large U.S. operations make it sensitive to the Fed's rate hikes, is in a shallow base with a 25.45 buy point. BofA shares edged up 0.4% to 25.16.Morgan Stanley is in a shallow base with a 49 buy point. Morgan Stanley climbed 0.8% to 48.26.PNC Financial Services cleared a flat base with a 133.36 buy point for most of the session, but closed up 0.3% to 133.35, a penny below that mark. PNC also topped that entry intraday Wednesday, but closed just below that level.Citigroup rose 0.4% to 71.76. Citigroup is still in buy range after clearing a 69.96 flat-base entry on Monday.The 10-year Treasury yield dipped intraday but closed little changed. Yields have risen sharply from 2017 lows over the past few weeks, lifting bank stocks.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday suggested that four more rate hikes through the end of next year were still likely, even as inflation readings remain lukewarm.However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the central bank's forecast reflected the sense that the weaker inflation seen this year has been caused by ""transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the coming year.""When the Fed charges more for overnight bank-to-bank loans of the funds it holds, the higher costs for those banks ripple through to consumers borrowing money from them. That can keep the economy from overexpanding, and can also help banks make more money from their own loans.IBD'S TAKE: Don't look to the Fed for a green light to buy stocks or a red light to sell them. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Fed on Wednesday also said it would begin whittling down the size of its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities next month. The central bank had bulked up on those securities after the financial crisis a decade ago in attempt to help the economy recover.That largely expected move could help increase long-term interest rates, aiding banks' profitability as the yield curve bends higher.RELATED:The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltCitigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near Buys5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumBanks And Financial Stock News

968,MS,"U.S. stock indexes rebounded midday Wednesday on a bullish durable-goods report and on news that President Trump will unveil this afternoon his plan for tax cuts and changes to the tax code.XThe Nasdaq charged ahead 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1% after paring gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.6%.Volume in the stock market today was higher vs. the previous session's pace.Economic news set a bullish tone before the market's open.Durable goods orders for August rose 1.7% vs. the consensus view for 1.5%. The surprise in the report came in core capital goods. The increase was 0.9%, three times better than the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Core capital goods is a proxy for business investment.Meanwhile, Trump will release the details of his tax-cut plan in a speech this afternoon in Indianapolis. The Indianapolis Star reported that the plan would double the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly and to $12,000 for individuals; cut the corporate tax from 35% to 20%; and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.However, some taxes would go up. Bloomberg News reported that the federal tax deduction claimed for state and local taxes would be eliminated. This would mainly affect people in states controlled by Democrats, such as California and New York — states that did not support Trump.The tax talk comes with a dose of skepticism because the Republican Congress has not yet shown the ability to unite on policies.In the Nasdaq 100, tech stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Data storage firm Micron Technology (MU) gapped up 7% to a new high. Chip equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) each popped 3%.Blue chips were mostly down. In the Dow Jones industrial average, losers led winners by a 9-to-7 ratio. Nike (NKE) scored the biggest loss, down 3.5% on a mixed quarterly report. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 1.6% and 1%, respectively.Banks led the stock market in the weeks after the November election. From Nov. 8 to Dec. 9 the money-center industry group rose 21% vs. 5% for the Nasdaq and 6% for the S&P 500. Money centers peaked in March with a 32% postelection gain and then corrected by 12%. In May, money centers began a rebound that took the group 13% above the May low.Bank of America (BAC) was a few pennies away from clearing a 25.45 buy point midday Wednesday. Other major banks, including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS), also were near buy points. Morgan Stanley is No. 2 among its industry group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com.Small caps also have seen a resurgence recently. From Election Day to Dec. 9, the small-cap S&P 600 jumped 18% but became a laggard this year. Yet, since Aug. 21, small caps have led the market's rebound — up 8% vs. 3% each for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.The action among banks and small caps raises the question of whether investors aren't seeing a return to strength among some aspects of the so-called Trump trade. Moves in interest rates also have influenced banking stocks.Before the market's open Thursday, the final number on second-quarter GDP will be released. The Street's consensus view, according to Econoday, calls for 3.1% growth, up from the second take's 3% and the first reading of 2.6%.

Citigroup and JPMorgan in July had already indicated that the trading environment for the third quarter would be, like the second quarter, more restrained.The big banks have largely telegraphed the more tepid trading environment for the quarter. Markets in recent months have suffered from low volatility compared with a year ago, when the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union and President Trump's election caused bigger market churns.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Citigroup rose 2.3% to 67.71 in the stock market today, reclaiming support at its 50-day line.

972,MS,"Everyone knows high prescription drug prices are a problem, but except for pharma stockholders, few people may realize that price cuts are rippling through the generic side of the industry.Take a look at recent events: Tumbling U.S. generic drug prices wiped out billions of dollars in market value in August for the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY). That compounded the industry's woes after a brutal second-quarter earnings season.The relatively small contingent of pharma companies that produce cheaper versions of brand-name drugs is getting broadsided by players in the distribution chain. For one, leading wholesalers are squeezing drugmakers for lower prices to undercut one another in the battle for pharmacy contracts. Meanwhile, group-purchasing organizations are consolidating and grabbing onto more negotiating power, representing a hurdle for generics which comprise a large chunk of those purchases.Analysts say it could be six to nine months before prices stabilize — if they ever recover at all. While that means lower prices for patients, drugmakers are taking the brunt of the battle. Prices have clearly deteriorated in the aftermath of contract negotiations, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an Aug. 12 audio report.""And the question really is: What does that mean going forward?,"" he said. ""Because if you look at the way Mylan and Teva stocks have behaved and you look at the way their estimates have been revised, it clearly suggests a material worsening in business.""Teva stock lost 50.7% in August, though it has recovered 7.9% this month, and the No. 1 drugmaker by market cap is close to losing that status. Since July 31, Teva's market value has fallen by nearly half to $17.56 billion. Comparatively, Mylan trails at a $16.85 billion cap.Teva isn't the only one feeling the pain. Selling pressures shaved $4 billion off Mylan's market capitalization in August, and its shares have toppled 19% since the beginning of August after particularly disheartening quarterly reports. As a whole, Investor's Business Daily's Generic Drugs industry group is down 6.6% year to date after nearing a four-year low in August. It's ranked No. 160 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.The underlying cause of the price erosion stems back to 2013-14, when drugmakers spiked prices based on shortages, monopolies and other opportunities, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan told IBD.""If something was $10 per day, you would see it up to $15 per day because you're the only one making it and there was no competition,"" he said. ""If there's no one else producing it, you have more flexibility (in how you price a drug).""""Now that card is gone,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The top-ranked generic drugmaker is Ani Pharmaceuticals, which has a middling CR of 61. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the stocks.That's not only because competition is more fierce, it's also that generics face another adversary: heavy scrutiny from the media and in Washington. In January, then President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" in their pricing. Now, he's aiming to use competition to undercut prices.Complicating matters, some drugmakers — Teva, Mylan and Perrigo (PRGO) included — are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged generic drug price fixing. Last month, two members of Congress sent letters to makers of multiple sclerosis drugs to probe rising drug prices.That's yet another wrench in the generic story, Divan says.""Investors are looking for cleaner stories,"" he said. ""And there's too much unknown here.""Teva and Mylan, on their second-quarter earnings calls, projected price erosion in the high-single digits for the rest of 2017. Mylan specified that erosion would take place in its North American generics unit. That followed lackluster quarterly reports from both. Mylan's North American sales declined 9%, while Teva's numbers were helped by the acquisition of Actavis Generics.Both Teva and Mylan cut their 2017 forecasts. On their calls, executives from the two companies acknowledged an increase in generic approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was champing at sales. New FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is looking to speed up generic approvals even more to help ease drug prices, which is in line with Trump's vision.""During the quarter we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics,"" Mylan President Rajiv Malik said. ""Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products.""As a result, Mylan said it would delay launching generic versions of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) asthma drug Advair and Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone amid the ""uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.""Teva's former interim chief executive, Yitzhak Peterburg, cited customer consolidation, an increase in FDA generic-drug approvals and products that were either delayed or subject to more competition for ""accelerated price erosion and decreased volume"" in the second quarter.FDA approval complications were cited across second-quarter reports, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in an Aug. 17 report to clients. Though generic approvals are catching some wind under the FDA's new goal, complex generics — a molecular copy that also has a complex active ingredient, formulation, route or device combination — have been subject to administrative delays.Koffler sees Mylan as best-positioned to rebound despite its tie to the challenged generics sector. The firm has a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars, guidance is now more realistic and it's less levered than its peers, meaning it could pursue acquisitions of companies whose stocks have dropped.""The risks are that pricing pressure in the U.S. may not abate, and the overall profitability of the company is declining as it expands into lower-margin international markets that now comprise a greater percentage of its revenue,"" she said.A few drugmakers seemingly escaped the second-quarter malaise. But those reports were somewhat misleading, CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo told IBD.Perrigo issued a beat-and-raise that helped its stock fly 16% in a day. Though Perrigo's generic drug sales toppled 13% year over year, its separate consumer health segments had smaller 4% and 9% declines in the U.S. and internationally, respectively.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) crushed second-quarter profit views, though sales came in a hair light. The firm also cut its 2017 revenue target, but kept its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization forecast.""A lot of people consider Valeant as a generic play, but the bulk of the business is now Bausch & Lomb"" eye-care products, Loo said. In the quarter, revenue from Bausch & Lomb as well as Salix, its gastrointestinal-drugs division, represented 73% of total sales. Its smaller generics unit, on the other hand, fell by 33%.""If you exclude Valeant from the generic space and Perrigo, none of these generic drugmakers really bucked the trend in the second quarter,"" Loo said. ""I think that it (pressure on the group) will likely continue going forward for the next two quarters.""Teva leads the U.S. generic drugs sector, but it's also under the most pressure, Steven Schoenfeld, chief information officer of BlueStar Indexes, told IBD. BlueStar Indexes tracks Israeli equities. Cybersecurity play Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is now bigger than Teva in terms of market cap, at $18.18 billion.Former Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman stepped down in February amid a bribery investigation. Since then, management has been shaky and the firm's strategy has been out of kilter, Schoenfeld says. This followed its loss of several key patents protecting MS drug Copaxone in January. In September, Teva named former Lundbeck and Novo Nordisk (NVO) veteran Kare Schultz as its new chief executive officer.Still, Teva is splitting its focus between generic and branded drugs, Schoenfeld says.""They need a strategy,"" he said. ""They need to see if they want to expand or continue to invest in blockbuster drugs. They've now got some early-stage Alzheimer's assets and other drugs. They have to decide if they're going to be X percentage generic and, if so, do the profits go into innovation?""Meanwhile, debt has rocketed and investors are no longer sure the $40.5 billion Teva paid to acquire Actavis Generics from Allergan (AGN) was a good price, he says. As of June 30, Teva had $35.1 billion in debt, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of March.Under Schultz, Teva recently avoided a covenant violation on its debt. On Sept. 19, Teva said it amended several term loans and revolving credit facilities, ""providing Teva greater flexibility in its financial leverage ratio covenants.""The question at the forefront now is whether the U.S. generic drugs sector has hit a bottom.In recent history, Mylan has come under scrutiny for the pricing of its emergency allergy injection, EpiPen. Turing Pharmaceuticals' former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, drew criticism for spiking the price of a decades-old HIV drug. Teva is among those being looked at for MS drug prices.""Popular culture has turned against it,"" BlueStar's Schoenfeld said. ""Secular trends aren't going to go away. The market sees pricing pressure. Have these stocks priced in the worst? Teva is trading where it had major support in the 2001-03 time frame. But I wouldn't recommend anyone plunge into Teva.""Most firms are now trading at four to five times their earnings, CFRA's Loo says. Amid continuing price erosion, he sees the stocks trading sideways for the next six months. He notes there aren't many drugs going off patent in the near future, causing somewhat of a roadblock for new generics.""I would like to hope they've hit a bottom,"" he said. ""There are not that many catalysts for them going forward. You might see some buyers step in and buy shares of these companies. Four to five times earnings is an awfully attractive valuation.""RELATED:Biogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: AnalystHow A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebound Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

973,MS,"Bond investors have finally done it, stretching out pricing for the next Federal Reserve rate hike beyond the point of absurdity — all the way to June 2018, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Tuesday's market action saw the 10-year Treasury yield sink 3 basis points to 2.13%, briefly falling to the lowest level since Nov. 10, two days after Election Day reset expectations for the U.S. economy.Yet the odds that financial markets are betting correctly about the rate outlook look minuscule at a time when so much is going right for the U.S. economy and the broader global economy.Industrial commodities prices are surging, a reflection of the most broad-based global expansion in a decade. Wage pressures are building, according to the Paychex-IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch, which on Tuesday reported 3% annual wage growth for the first time since the recession. The jobless rate is at a 16-year low 4.3% and numerous economists expect it to fall to 4.0% within a matter of months and keep falling.Even tragedy may lift U.S. economic growth. While Hurricane Harvey's devastating floods will depress immediate economic activity, as the waters recede there likely will be a construction boom in Houston, with the need to replace thousands upon thousands of ruined vehicles.Bank stocks have been paying the price for falling Treasury yields and the downgraded Fed rate-hike outlook, which cast doubt on the expectation of higher rates and wider net-interest margins that helped make the sector one of the winners of the postelection rally. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all slipped below their 50-day moving averages. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both fallen below buy points, potentially negative signs advising investors to remain on the sidelines. JPMorgan remains in a buy zone above an 89.23 buy point from a double-bottom base.IBD'S TAKE: Bullish chart patterns showing a stock breaking out of base into a buy zone give investors the best chance of reaping near-term gain, especially when a series of other important factors is present.While headlines about North Korea drove a safety bid in Treasuries early on Tuesday, stocks recovered from early losses and turned in decent gains. The real game-changer for markets has been the disinflationary trend that has seen the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures annual inflation rate slide from 2.2% in February to 1.4% in June, with core inflation easing to 1.4% from 1.9%. (July figures are due out on Thursday morning.)But markets are seriously overestimating the Fed's patience. The reason for the current consensus to keep rates on hold until at least December is that Fed policy makers have pretty clearly decided to use this window to shift their reinvestment policy and begin gradually scaling back the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The change, allowing principal in maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds to run off, rather than reinvesting it, is itself a tightening of policy, so the Fed doesn't want to hike rates at the same time.With wage growth creeping higher and the jobless rate sinking, Fed members are very likely to hike again sooner than markets expect. Industrial metals prices, a leading indicator of inflation, are on the rise, with copper, aluminum, and zinc all at multiyear highs, which has sparked breakouts of mining stocks like BHP Billiton, Southern Copper and Vale over the past week.The weakness in Treasury yields as miners surge doesn't make a ton of sense. While higher commodity prices partially reflect dollar weakness, eventually that weak dollar will put upward pressure on prices of U.S. imports.Hurricane Harvey could intensify an apparent shortage of construction workers, while a surge in used car demand could at least temporarily ease a supply glut that's weighing on used car prices.Meanwhile, Trump policies also may have inflationary consequences. The Commerce Department is collecting preliminary duties of 17% to 31% on Canadian softwood lumber used in home building. Trump may decide this week to walk away from President Obama's deportation deferral program for people who arrived in the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants when they were children, which would gradually phase out their work permits.While subdued inflation pressure reflects competitive pressures in a wide of array of industries, including the grocery industry that just saw Amazon.com buy Whole Foods, the inflation outlook won't be tame enough to keep the Fed on the sidelines for long with unemployment headed to 4%.RELATED:4 Miners, 2 Clinical Trial Plays Ace Buy Points, Take New HighsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

974,MS,"Shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks were pulled lower on Tuesday by sinking bond yields, which have reached their lowest point since just before the presidential election.XThe slide followed reports in recent days that North Korea had tested a hydrogen bomb and could be planning a test of another intercontinental ballistic missile. Investors have flocked to safer investments, like government bonds, amid the escalating international strain, driving yields lower.JPMorgan skidded 2.4% in the stock market today, Bank of America lost 3.2%, Goldman Sachs fell 3.6%, Citigroup (C) dropped 2.1%, and Morgan Stanley (MS) gave up 2.8%. Those stocks were all below their 50-day lines after testing support at the key metric last week. Wells Fargo (WFC), which has crumbled as it deals with a widening fake account scandal, fell 1.7% on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.07% on Tuesday, hitting the lowest levels since the presidential election. The 10-year yield helps set the value of different types of credit and is seen as a gauge of investors' longer-term inflation expectations. Meanwhile the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields hit a 1-year low.Yields spiked following the election on hopes President Trump's plans to grow the economy would push inflation higher and lead the Fed to more aggressively raise interest rates — a move the banks would match by hiking their own interest rates on loans.Higher interest rates and wider yield spreads can help banks on the top and bottom lines. But the stocks have leveled off over the past few months as banks temper their financial outlooks.RELATED:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisDow Retakes 22,000 Level Thanks To GE, Strength In FinancialsBofA, Goldman Beat But See Trading, Net Interest Income Weakness

977,MS,"Right now financial markets couldn't care less about a tight job market and upward pressure on wages.Sentiment can only move in a negative direction from here, and there's a decent chance that Friday's August jobs report could be the first step toward such a shift.Another strong payroll increase is widely expected, with Wall Street predicting a 180,000 gain. The Amazon.com (AMZN) jobs day on Aug. 2, a one-day 50,000 hiring binge, will likely boost the total, which reflect payrolls during the midmonth survey week.The two big numbers to watch, though, are the jobless rate, which could slip to a new 16-year low of 4.2% (markets are expecting a steady 4.3% rate) and average hourly wage growth, which is seen ticking up to an annual 2.6% gain but could surprise on the upside.A drop in the jobless rate is hardly a sure thing, but it wouldn't rank as much of a surprise, especially since the ranks of the unemployed have actually climbed the past two months in a short-term reversal of the trend.A number of factors highlight the possibility of an upside surprise for wage growth. For one thing, another 9-cent increase in average hourly wages, as seen in July, would lift the annual gain to 2.8%. Meanwhile, the Paychex-IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch on Tuesday reported 3% annual wage growth for the first time since the recession.IBD's own analysis of daily Treasury statements shows that federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks have been growing at a solid 5.4% annual rate in recent months vs. the 2.0% annual gain in aggregate hours worked. That also suggests wage growth is closer to 3% than 2.5%.Companies continue to highlight growing wage pressures in earnings calls. A notable recent example came from Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), the largest franchisee for the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain. In an Aug. 10 conference call, the company said it's seeing 6.8% wage inflation, up from 6% the prior quarter and the 3% to 5% range it anticipated back in November.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market has been on a roll lately, and IBD readers were prepared. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The point isn't that wage inflation — or consumer price inflation — is in danger of taking off, only that markets have grown too complacent about Federal Reserve policy at a time of near-full employment in the U.S. and the broadest global growth in a decade, which is pushing up industrial metals prices. It seems like only a matter of time before there's a wakeup call.San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in early August that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year-end and offered these words of caution: ""We don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point.""The Fed wants to avoid a situation in which it has to tighten policy more quickly, raising the risk that the economy would stall. In the minutes of the Fed's July meeting, policymakers also upped their assessment of vulnerabilities associated with asset-price levels from ""notable"" to ""elevated.""If and when sentiment shifts, bank stocks will likely be the winners. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have all slipped to or below their 50-day moving averages. That's happened as bond investors have stretched out pricing for the next Federal Reserve rate hike all the way to June 2018, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, dampening the outlook for banks' net interest margins.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both fallen below buy points. JPMorgan remains in a buy zone above an 89.23 buy point from a double-bottom base.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, the S&P 500 index started strong, striving for a fifth-straight gain and approaching its all-time high. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.13%, just above the lows since the week of the 2016 election, when the prospect of a unified GOP government reset growth expectations higher.Market expectations sharply contrast with Fed members' own June consensus of four more rate hikes through the end of 2018, though the surprisingly tame inflation data of recent months has likely shifted that consensus in a more dovish direction.RELATED:The Bond Market Is Going CrazyLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

978,MS,"Biogen (BIIB) stock jumped and neared a buy point Monday after its Alzheimer's disease treatment showed promise at the two-year and three-year marks.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen shares climbed 2.5% 292.30, after rising as much as 3.7% to hit an intraday high of 295.50. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 297.05, though they haven't topped 297 since early March.A common theory ties Alzheimer's to the buildup of plaque deposits in the brain called beta amyloid. Biogen is among those working on drugs to reduce amyloid deposits. Last year, Eli Lilly's (LLY) anti-amyloid drug failed to prove this theory.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen has an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it outperforms nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still trails top-rated biotech Celgene (CELG), which has a best-possible CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for other highly rated biotechs.Biogen could be closing in on proving the hypothesis. Scans showed amyloid reduction was consistent in patients treated with adjusted doses compared with fixed doses over two years. Patients treated up to three years showed a continued benefit on the rate of amyloid decline.In the Phase 1b long-term trial, the most common side effects were headache, falling and abnormalities in amyloid-related imaging, Biogen said. The firm plans to share more data at an upcoming medical congress.RELATED:Shire Nears 4-Year Low After CFO Announces Plan To Jump ShipBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeBiogen Up On Alzheimer's Drug; Are MS Worries 'Overblown'?

979,MS,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

980,MS,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting. Fidelity added exposure to big banks Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) by boosting share counts 4.4% and 3.8% respectively.But Fidelity cut share counts in Goldman Sachs (GS) by 9.8%, in Morgan Stanley (MS) by 8.1%, in Wells Fargo (WFC) by 7.9%, and in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 7.5%.It also trimmed share count in credit card network Mastercard (MA) by 2.2%.The $39.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) and $22.7 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) both held top-10 positions in Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) as of June 30, Rosenbluth reported.TIPS & TOOLS:Is this a good time to buy Fidelity's top holdings?

981,MS,"Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS) rocketed to a four-month high Thursday after an analyst upgraded the stock ahead of data expected in November from an immuno-oncology partnership with Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Corvus popped as much as 9.6% to a high last seen in early April, but recently was up 7.6%, near 14, in recent trades. Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) also lifted 2.2%, near 57.50, after grabbing an upgrade.Meanwhile, downgraded Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) sank 0.3%, near 16.40. Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), though, rose 1.8%, near 9.70, after sustaining a price-target haircut.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan upgraded Corvus to neutral from an underperform rating and boosted his price target to 14 from 12. During the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting in November, the firm is expected to unveil Phase 1 data for its drug known as CPI-444.CPI-444 is designed to block the action of a molecule produced by tumors that hinders immune response. Corvus began a Phase 1B trial with Genentech in early 2016 to look at CPI-444 alone and in combination with an immuno-oncology drug known as a PD-L1 antibody.""Our underperform rating on Corus had been driven by limited enthusiasm around the clinical data to date for CPI-444, as well as a quiet near-term catalyst calendar,"" Divan wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever has chilled over the past several weeks following the second-quarter earnings season. IBD's 445-company Biotech industry group is now ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, down from fifth just a month ago. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the issues boiling under the surface.Divan also upgraded Portola to outperform from a neutral rating and kept his 70 price target. The stock has sold off following its second-quarter earnings report in which the biotech said it's working through some manufacturing issues that could delay the launch of its drug, Bevyxxa.Bevyxxa is a treatment to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients at risk due to moderate or severe mobility restrictions. It's Portola's only approved drug. But approval also could be coming for its drug, AndexXa, an anticoagulant.Teva, on the other hand, sustained a downgrade to underperform from a neutral rating and Divan slashed his price target to 13 from 25.""While Teva has dramatically reduced fiscal 2017 guidance, we do not expect the core challenges they are facing to fade anytime soon,"" he wrote. Teva continues to face pricing pressure in U.S. generics and upcoming competition for its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.The firm has yet to appoint a full-time chief executive and is talking about potential sales of noncore assets to pay down debt that eclipsed $35 billion in the June quarter. Divan wants to see the final details of these transactions before ""giving Teva full credit.""He also trimmed his price target on Alder to 11 from 17, though kept his neutral rating. Alder will most likely have to spend significantly to compete in a crowded market, he said. A key migraine drug, eptinezumab, is in Phase 3 trials and is rivaled by drugs from Teva, Eli Lilly (LLY) and Amgen (AMGN).""Upside risk could come from positive updates on a self-administration formulation and more differentiated clinical data,"" he said. ""Downside risk could come from strong competitor launches or setbacks in eptinezumab development.""RELATED:Teva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key DrugsBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: Analyst

982,MS,"Millennials are ""moving the needle"" for animal-health companies like Idexx Laboratories (IDXX), Abaxis (ABAX) and Heska (HSKA), an analyst said Monday as he reiterated a buy rating on Idexx following the firm's Investor Day.XOver the past five to 10 years, pet-related spending has risen as new millennial pet owners have entered the market, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro said. Millennials are taking their pets to the vet at higher rates than their Gen X and Baby Boomer counterparts.""We believe the millennial impact is twofold — millennial pet owners are spending more and taking their pets to the vet at a higher rate, and millennial veterinarians appear to be more willing to order new cutting-edge diagnostic testing,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Based on survey data Idexx presented during its Investor Day, 67% of millennials, customers ages 19 to 36, noted bringing their pets to the vet more than once per year, compared with 58% of Gen X owners and 39% of baby boomers, Massaro said.This is likely to best benefit Idexx, which makes diagnostic tests and chemistry panels for veterinary offices. Massaro sees Idexx as ""dominant and hardly rivaled"" in the global vet landscape where demand could remain high for at least the next two years.According to Idexx, 41% of about 200 million clinical vet visits any year include a diagnostic test, though only 12% of visits include a chemistry panel. Practices ranking within the top 2% of Idexx's clients complete 2.4 times more chemistry panels than the average client.""We think this number is likely to increase as preventative care visits become more popular and millennials continue to 'humanize' their pets,"" Massaro said. ""We believe this number could tick up to 15% as favorable macro trends materialize and as Idexx adds additional tests to its chemistry panel.""IBD'S TAKE: Idexx has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 77, though it has lifted as high as 83 out of a best-possible 99 earlier this month. Head to IBD Data Stories for more on what goes into ranking a stock.Massaro kept his buy rating and 180 price target on Idexx stock. A recent slump in Idexx represents a rare buying opportunity, he said.Idexx began forming a flat base in early June with a buy point at 173.11. But shares are well below their 50-day trading average this month.During its Investor Day last week in Maine, Idexx reiterated its outlook for 10% top-line growth to 2022 and 15% to 20% growth on a constant currency basis. Growth in the U.S. is expected to be 9%-13% with 12%-16% growth in international recurring revenue.Recurring revenue, driven by diagnostics, now represents 88% of total sales, Idexx said. Its customer retention rate is 98% to 99%. The company also has doubled its sales force to 435 in North America since 2012. Massaro argues neither of its key diagnostic rivals ""can meaningfully challenge Idexx.""The next catalyst will be in late October when Idexx reports third-quarter results and likely offers 2018 guidance. Massaro raised his 2017-18 adjusted earnings view to $3.17 per share and $3.66 per share, respectively. He also sees 2019 sales of $2.33 billion and adjusted income of $4.25 a share.On the stock market today, Idexx was nearly flat, losing 3 cents tot 150.41.RELATED:All Eyes Will Be On This Dow Component's 'Star' Drug Next WeekHow Two Drugmakers Will Benefit On AstraZeneca's CoattailsBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing Probe

984,MS,"As the cryptocurrency market cap cracks the $100 billion barrier, digital cash like bitcoin has become increasingly difficult for finance's old guard to ignore.XGoldman Sachs (GS) in a note this week outlined the basics of bitcoin investing to clients. CBOE Holdings (CBOE) last week said it planned to debut its own bitcoin futures. Fidelity Investments on Wednesday said it partnered with Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, in a test project that allows most customers to view data on Fidelity.com which shows the digital cash they hold on that exchange.""This integration demonstrates the continued commitment of traditional financial institutions to adopt digital assets and widen access for customers,"" Coinbase said in a blog post about the Fidelity test.But actually allowing clients to trade bitcoin? That could take some time for the nation's largest financial institutions.Even as bigger investors step into the bitcoin arena, regulations across the world are inconsistent, observers say. Access to an exchange where someone can trade bitcoin depends on geographic location. Different states have different license requirements. Regulatory agencies might have different rules around trading cryptocurrency from nation to nation.Goldman, in its note, also pointed out that the market was still relatively small and subject to whipsaw price swings, but that investors could use block trading for bigger orders.""What the big players and the reputable companies need is, in particular, a legal and regulatory stable environment,"" said Marco Khron, CFO of Genesis Mining, a bitcoin mining company. ""They are reluctant also because, or in part because, some of it is kind of a new area for them.""Bitcoin and blockchain — the ledger technology that underpins bitcoin transactions — are ""emerging from their infancy, but mass adoption is still many years away,"" Hadley Stern, senior vice president and managing director at Fidelity's R&D unit, Fidelity Labs, said in a statement on Wednesday.Still, Coinbase Partnerships Lead Kristen Stone, in an email, said the company has seen a ""significant uptick"" in interest from bigger financial players. The company said that over the past six months, financial firms like hedge funds and proprietary trading firms have started trading bitcoin and ether, another digital currency. Many were still exploring the possibilities, but a few had started to test strategies in the market, she said.""As bitcoin liquidity increases, I expect that major US banks would also become interested in exploring the space,"" she said.The moves from the larger financial institutions come during an eventful few weeks for bitcoin. After a dispute over the best way to speed transaction-processing, a portion of the bitcoin community this month spun off Bitcoin Cash, an offshoot of bitcoin. Bitcoin surged to a record high earlier this week, while Bitcoin Cash nose-dived, possibly as more traders flocked to bitcoin or returned to it after waiting out the split, an analyst told Bloomberg.Bitcoin's prices can be sensitive, twitching higher or lower depending on when a bigger investor makes a move. Perception also goes a long way.""People's impression of how valuable this is, because the market is still fairly young, is more important than, let's say, when you're trading equities or certain fixed income, or traditional and regulated asset classes,"" said Lex Sokolin, global director, fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.That proneness to volatility has attracted traders with an appetite for risk. Bitcoin also tends to move independently from stocks and bonds. The currency is also seen as a cushion against political turmoil, given its ""decentralized structure,"" according to a statement from crypto-asset broker Bitcoin Suisse.Banks' adoption of blockchain, the ledger technology that is the basis for bitcoin transactions, has already been widespread. At least one bank has become more open to trading bitcoin.Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank said last month that it got the OK from regulators to allow clients to buy, sell and hold bitcoin through the bank. The bank will be working with Bitcoin Suisse to provide that service to clients.Meanwhile, the currency continues to attract investment firms sometimes backed by more well-known, deep-pocketed names. The Digital Currency Group has gotten investment money from Mastercard (MA) and Bain Capital Ventures. Pantera Capital, another cyrptocurrency-centric firm, has a bitcoin investment fund that has been backed by the likes of Fortress Investment Group.Harmonizing regulations could take time. Fraud and security remain concerns for traditional investors.The SEC in July said that U.S. securities law ""may apply"" to offers of digital assets like popular Initial Coin Offerings, which raise funds via digital assets. But the cryptocurrency market could claim more victims before solid rules are established.""I think the question is: How much money do people first need to lose in order for a regulator to step in?"" Sokolin said.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) declined to answer questions about their plans for bitcoin trading. JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for an interview.But Goldman analysts, in their note to clients, signaled that cryptocurrencies are no longer a fringe, cyberpunk endeavor.""Indeed the debate has shifted from the legitimacy of the 'fiat of the internet' to how fast new entrants are raising funds,"" Goldman analysts said in a recent note that contained an FAQ to clients.""Whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are) real dollars are at work here and warrant watching especially in light of the growing world of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fundraising that now exceeds Internet Angel and Seed investing,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an exchange traded fund tailored to the price of the digital currency, rose 10% in the stock market today.RELATED:Frustrated JPMorgan CEO Unleashes This Tirade On U.S. 'Stupidity'Here Is The First Bank To Warn On The Q3 Trading Environment

985,MS,"Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) broke out of a base Tuesday, and Bank of America (BAC) was on the cusp of an entry, as the 10-year Treasury yield ticked up amid signs of a strengthening economy.XThe 10-year Treasury yield influences the value of different types of credit and is seen as a window into investors' expectations for inflation.

"
986,MS,"A strange-bedfellows mix of Democrats and Republicans have called for resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking.For most of the 20th Century the law held back Main Street banks and shielded the big Wall Street banks from those smaller competitors. Why would anyone want that old problem back again?Democrats have blamed the law's 1999 repeal for causing the 2007-2008 financial crisis, while some Republicans have latched onto the old government mandate as a way to protect Main Street banks and consumers from Wall Street abuses. Both of these notions are dead wrong.The financial crisis was not caused by allowing commercial and investment banks to be owned by the same parent corporation. The institutions that failed were either predominantly commercial or investment banks, but not both.The commercial banks that failed, such as Wachovia, Washington Mutual and IndyMac, did so because they invested in subprime mortgages. The investment banks that got into trouble, such as Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, had no commercial bank affiliations.The excessive risk-taking that lead to bank losses occurred in mortgage lending and securitization (the repackaging of pooled assets into securities), completely legal practices that would have occurred even under a Glass-Steagall regime.In fact, separating banking activities would have increased the severity of the crisis. Investment banks that found themselves in liquidity crunches, such as Merrill Lynch, were able to be acquired by larger deposit-taking institutions, namely Bank of America, rather than go bankrupt.Further, when Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were under stress to acquire short-term funding, they were allowed to quickly reorganize into financial holding companies with commercial banking arms. The ability of these institutions to diversify their activities sheltered the financial system from further losses.The most-integrated banks, those with both commercial- and investment-banking arms, were the strongest during the crisis. This remains the case today. The most recent Federal Reserve stress tests show that the banks that engage in unified banking, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), are in fact the healthiest.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two banks that concentrate primarily on investment banking, came the closest to failing on key measurements. Simply separating bank activities does not make the financial system any safer, nor would have it prevented the 2007-08 crisis.The second mistake of Glass-Steagall proponents is their claim that they are ""taking on Wall Street."" In reality, piling on complex regulations only serves to enrich well-connected big banks at the expense of smaller ones. Glass-Steagall systematically destroyed Main Street investment banking over its 66-year reign.Prior to the government-imposed firewall, many commercial banks in cities throughout the country were active in securities underwriting and distribution.For example, the Trust Company of Georgia, predecessor of SunTrust Banks (STI), organized a stock offering of Coca-Cola (KO) in 1919. Local residents of Atlanta, who celebrated not having to sell out to ""New York interests,"" subsequently bought nearly half of Coca-Cola's stock.That would not be possible under Glass-Steagall. The firewall forbade local commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, relegating the latter to specialized firms in New York.Bringing back a failed government policy would only redistribute assets and activities among the existing big banks. The 10 largest banks would all remain designated as ""too-big-to-fail"" under a new Glass-Steagall, with the pure investment banks such as Goldman Sachs growing to become more systemically important, as American Enterprise Institute scholar Paul Kupiec has found.It is little wonder then why Gary Cohn, the director of President Trump's National Economic Council and former Goldman Sachs executive, is in favor of the measure.The real solution to today's financial woes is opening up the financial services sector to greater competition. House Republicans have been moving in the right direction by passing the Financial Choice Act this year, which would allow Main Street banks to grow their communities while removing Wall Street's protections.If the Senate does its part to pass the bill and send it to the President to sign, that is a policy that will foster an efficient and stable financial system that all Americans can rely upon.

989,MS,"Not long after the close of the big banks' second-quarter earnings season, Goldman Sachs (GS) has already begun to warn on the current quarter's trading performance.XCFO Martin Chavez said that the low volatility seen in Q2 has spilled over into Q3, according to Reuters.The remarks came after Goldman last month reported a 40% drop in fixed-income, currency and commodities revenue for Q2.On its earnings call last month, Goldman said it ""didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to or as well as we have in the past,"" echoing similar language on its Q1 call, when trading also suffered.Shares of Goldman were up 0.7% at 227 on the stock market today, with Wall Street apparently already expecting the more tranquil trading conditions. The stock is currently in a consolidation.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rallied 1.3% to 93.03, still within buy range of a 89.23 double-bottom buy point. Bank of America (BAC) rose 1.4% to 24.45, as it works on a 25.21 buy point from a shallow cup-with-handle base. Citigroup (C) added 1.7%, climbing further above buy range.Chavez's remarks also came little more than a week after Morgan Stanley (MS), up 0.7%, briefly surpassed Goldman in market value. Morgan Stanley's Q2 fixed-income trading revenue fell only 4%.Other big banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup also took a hit on trading in Q2, with the absence of big market shocks taming client actions.During JPMorgan's Q2 earnings call, CFO Marianne Lake said that in Q3, the company was lapping a period marked by strong trading.

990,MS,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were mixed early Friday, following broad-based selling Thursday.XIn Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages. Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Sina (SINA), Morgan Stanley (MS), Square (SQ) and Qualys (QLYS) were among the many leading stocks falling below recent buy points Thursday, with Square and other top stocks breaking through 50-day support. Some recent breakouts are struggling to hang on, such as Netflix (NFLX).Nvidia late Thursday reported blowout Q2 earnings and bullish Q3 revenue guidance, though some cited concerns over Q2 data center revenue. Nvidia shares tumbled more than 7% Friday morning, after big losses on Thursday before results. Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP) was a different story with the same ending. Snap's adjusted loss, revenue, user growth and average revenue per user missed forecasts, sending shares crashing 13% toward record lows.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.1% below fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.3% against fair value while Dow futures were essentially flat.Asian markets retreated, with China's Shanghai composite off 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 2%. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE lost 1.2%, Germany's Dax 0.3% and France's CAC-40 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. Due to the negative action Thursday and in recent days for the major averages and leading stocks, the market direction has been downgraded to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend.""So what should you do as an investor now?Distribution days are piling up rapidly on the Nasdaq composite, signaling institutional selling.In isolation, many top stocks don't look that bad. Apple fell 3.6% on Thursday to 155.32, back below a 165.75 flat-base entry. If markets improve, Apple could easily regain that entry. But combine that with Nvidia, Square, Electronic Arts (EA) and others that have sunk back into bases, and the overall trend does not look favorable.Netflix is technically back in buy range after sinking 3.8% Thursday. But after two days of selling in above-average volume, Netflix is close to round-tripping from its late-July post-earnings breakout. Netflix fell 1.3% to 166.95 early Friday, right at the 166.97 entry.The market is not in a correction. But consider taking profits in winning stocks. Don't let a hefty gain turn into a loser. Cut losses as quickly as possible.When the market turns lower or even just choppy, it's hard to make money. Yes, there will be breakouts, like Planet Fitness (PLNT) on Thursday, but they will be less common and more likely to fail.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, is a de facto gauge of market fear. It spiked Thursday to its highest levels since mid-May, after sinking to record lows in late July. The VIX continued to climb overnight, setting nine-month highs.The put/call ratio is elevated. Extreme levels can signal market turns. But keep in mind that these are secondary indicators vs. the more-important primary indicators of the major averages and leading stocks.RELATED:Big Picture: Market Uptrend Is Under PressureThese 5 Stocks Bucked The Market Drop; Which Ones Hit Buy Points?Fear Gauge Hits Record Low; What Stocks Did Next Should Scare YouInvestor Fear Returns, But This Safe Haven Shines: Action PlanNetflix Fall Continues Over End Of Disney Movie DealNvidia Earnings Crush Views, Guidance Bullish, But Stock Dives

But the MS landscape is changing with new drugs. Take a closer look by visiting IBD's Technology page.Leerink analyst Paul Matteis agreed, writing in a research report that ""now is not the ideal time for M&A."" Acorda is about five to seven months away from Phase 3 data of tozadenant in Parkinson's disease.Acorda will also likely have an appellate ruling for Ampyra within the next year, he said. In April, several patents protecting Ampyra were invalidated, making it easier for generics to compete. To cope, Acorda put four drugs on the back burner. Matteis assumes generic rivalry in 2018.In a bidding process, Acorda would likely draw a wide spread of bids as potential buyers aren't likely to value tozadenant as highly as Acorda does. The drug isn't yet de-risked, Matteis said.""Large companies are generally reticent to pay a large sum for neuroscience assets with outstanding binary event risk,"" he said. ""Tozadenant benefits from solid Phase 2 results, but is a member of an emerging category of Parkinson's medicines that has been plagued by multiple late-stage failures.""Matteis kept his market perform rating on Acorda. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Acorda dove 2.9%, near 21.50.

994,MS,"The Federal Reserve did just what Wall Street wanted and expected on Wednesday: It kept its key interest rate steady and decided to wait at least a couple of months before starting to scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It's a signal from policymakers that they aren't overly concerned about equity prices even as the major averages hit fresh all-time highs.XFed policymakers had already signaled that they wouldn't hike the overnight lending rate for the third time this year as they wait for a clearer picture on the inflation outlook. The only real question was whether the Fed would announce a change in reinvestment policy — letting its asset portfolio gradually run off as mortgage and Treasury bonds mature — or would wait until the September 19-20 meeting. The Fed's statement that the change would happen ""relatively soon"" essentially locked in September.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average all hit record highs Wednesday morning but then backed off. The S&P 500 index, essentially flat heading into the Fed announcement, closed that way. The Nasdaq climbed nearly 0.2%. The Dow industrials led with a 0.45% gain, but Boeing (BA) accounted for all of that advance and more.On the margins, a quicker implementation of the reinvestment shift would likely be positive for bank stocks like Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which until the past few days had mostly been sidelined in the latest phase of the stock market rally amid dovish signals from the Fed.After the Fed announcement, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America slightly extended losses, all closing about 1%. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are still in buy range from recent breakouts. BofA was modestly below a cup-with-handle buy point at 25.22. Citigroup, which offered upbeat guidance on Tuesday, climbed back near its recent seven-year high.IBD'S TAKE: Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the top-rated companies in the Banks-Money Center and Banks-Super Regional industry groups based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance.Shifting reinvestment policy this month would have sent some not-so-welcome signals to investors. One signal would have been that Fed committee members may be getting a bit nervous about equity and other asset values. It also would underscored that the hawks aren't convinced by the recent muted inflation data and want to maintain flexibility to raise rates again before December, when market pricing suggests the next hike will come.Conversely, holding off on the change until September suggests that policymakers aren't particularly concerned about equity valuations, even amid another leg upward for the stock market.A Bloomberg survey of Fed watchers gave just 13% odds of a reinvestment change on July 26, though most observers were expecting it to happen at the next meeting.Economists see a gradual move away from the Fed's current stance of reinvesting all principal from maturing bonds as likely to put upward pressure on long-term interest rates. Goldman Sachs figures the shift could raise the 10-year Treasury yield by 20 basis points over time. That would contribute to an upward sloping yield curve, a positive for banks' net interest margins.Recently, the dollar has dived to its lowest level in more than a year, partly on expectations of a more patient Fed. The weaker greenback is a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals such as Dow components Apple (AAPL), Boeing, Microsoft (MSFT) and Wal-Mart (WMT), helping to support the current rally. The dollar slid vs. other major currencies following the Fed statement, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell.Fed chief Janet Yellen's July 12 testimony to Congress, along with a speech by leading Fed dove Lael Brainard the prior day, helped spark the current stock rally. Yellen made clear that the softening in inflation since March had ""made it difficult to form a consensus view"" on near-term interest-rate policy, wrote Ward McCarthy, Jefferies chief financial economist.For now, Yellen will be content to watch the data for clearer evidence that inflation is on the rise because the Fed can begin scaling back its balance sheet in the interim. While the initial reductions will be quite modest, up to $10 billion per month, the Fed members have signaled that they want to have a window to implement the change while holding rates steady to avoid any market turbulence. Fed Gov. Brainard offered an even more dovish outlook for policy, insisting that rate hikes must pause, but allowing that a reinvestment shift was warranted.The Fed's policy announcement comes a day after President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he could reappoint Yellen to another term as Fed chief, but that he's also considering economic adviser Gary Cohn.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Earnings, Trading Revenue Push Stock Into Buy ZoneFed Chief Yellen Won't Fight The Doves Yet; Stocks FlyDraghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market Support

997,MS,"The Federal Reserve's hawks and doves agree on one thing: The time has come to begin scaling back the $4.5 trillion balance sheet bloated by market interventions in the wake of the financial crisis.XWhile divisions appear deeper over how the Fed should adjust its key overnight lending rate, its usual monetary policy tool, policymakers could announce a change in reinvestment policy — letting its portfolio gradually run off as mortgage and Treasury bonds mature — at any time, including on Wednesday.An announcement at the end of the Fed's two-day meeting this week wouldn't rank as a huge surprise. Although a Bloomberg survey of Fed watchers gave just 13% odds of a reinvestment change on July 26, most observers expect it to happen at the next meeting on Sept. 19-20. Still, an earlier launch could have a few repercussions, albeit ones that are likely modest in scope.Shifting reinvestment policy this month would send a few not especially welcome signals to investors. One signal would be that Fed committee members are getting a bit nervous about equity and other asset values. Another would be that the hawks aren't convinced by the recent muted inflation data and want to maintain flexibility to hike rates earlier than December, when market pricing suggests the next hike will come.On the margins, a reinvestment shift on Wednesday would likely be positive for bank stocks like Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which have mostly been sidelined in the latest phase of the stock market rally that was abetted by dovish signals from the Fed.On Tuesday, as the Fed began meeting and The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index registered its highest level for present conditions since 2001, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 6 basis points to 2.31%. Meanwhile, Citigroup gave upbeat earnings projections at an analyst meeting.

That would contribute to an upward sloping yield curve, a positive for banks' net interest margins.Another potential impact of a Fed reinvestment policy shift on Wednesday might be a halt to, and partial reversal of, the dollar's recent dive to its lowest level in more than a year. The falling dollar, at least partially a response to expectations of a more patient Fed, is a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals such as Dow components Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and has helped support the current rally.Fed chief Janet Yellen's July 12 testimony to Congress, along with a speech by leading Fed dove Lael Brainard the prior day, helped spark the current stock rally.

1000,MS,"Here's one of the biggest problems with President Trump taking credit for the Dow Jones industrial average's rise close to 22,000, as he did on Tuesday.X""Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!"" Trump tweeted.While there's no question that Trump has presided over a great period for the stock market, many of the so-called Trump stocks that were supposed to thrive on his watch have been laggards, such as Vulcan Materials (VMC), U.S. Steel (X) and Goldman Sachs (GS).At the same time, what might be called non-Trump stocks, have done pretty nicely. If there was any group for which Trump's election looked like a setback, it was the solar power industry. Yet IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks No. 1 among 197 industry groups based on stock performance. Since Trump announced his plan to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, stocks like First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) have been surging. (SunPower crashed 19% Wednesday on weak revenue guidance. First Solar, which reported strong results last week, dipped 2% but held onto most of its recent gains.)IBD'S TAKE: The No. 1 ranked insurer in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group isn't Dow stalwart UnitedHealth Group, which exited most ObamaCare markets early in 2017, but an insurer whose prospects are closely tied to the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which insurer is setting the pace, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.The latest Trump stock to divee was Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a supplier of concrete, asphalt and other building materials that stood to benefit from Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. On Tuesday, Martin Marietta came up 10 cents shy of earnings estimates and shares tumbled 6.4%, closing below where they finished on Nov. 9.Vulcan Materials, the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates, fell 3.2% on Tuesday to close below its Election Day, Nov. 8 level. Vulcan Materials did rebound 3.3% on the stock market today despite reporting its own weak earnings.Infrastructure plans have been on the back burner while Trump prioritized the seemingly failed effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.The steel sector was supposed to soar on Trump steel tariffs that looked like a sure bet, but no longer look so certain after pushback from foreign trading partners. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that action to curtail steel imports may wait until after tax reform and infrastructure. U.S. Steel briefly surged on positive earnings news last week, but was quickly undercut by the disappointment over tariffs. U.S. Steel and Nucor (NUE) both closed lower on Tuesday than they did on Nov. 9.Bank stocks were supposed to be another triple-threat group under Trump, poised to gain from regulatory relief, tax cuts and rising interest rates prompted in part by Trump's big fiscal plans. Here the record is somewhat better. Regulators did sign off on bigger capital return plans for big banks that passed their stress tests. But Wall Street has been scaling back expectations for corporate-tax cuts and the Federal Reserve has tabled its rate-hiking plans as inflation pressures fail to materialize. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares surged in the weeks after Trump's election, but they've been Dow laggards since the start of 2017, with Goldman down 5% and JPMorgan up 8%, compared to the Dow's 11% gain and the Nasdaq's 18%.Many banks have reported weak trading revenue in early 2017, but Goldman reported a stunning 40% plunge in fixed income, commodity and currency trading revenue in the second quarter.While bank stocks have been mostly range-bound in recent months, Morgan Stanley (MS) has cleared a buy point and Bank of America (BAC) is near a buy zone above 25.21. But even those two bank leaders have slightly lagged the general market over the past four months.The expectations were that Trump would fuel growth and the Fed would be more proactive about raising interest rates, but with doubts creeping higher about the scope and timing of any fiscal fuel, some economists have marked down their growth expectations. The International Monetary Fund said last week that it now expects GDP growth of 2.1% this year and next, down from prior forecasts of 2.3% growth this year and 2.5% in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetSolar Stocks Shine As South Miami Passes Groundbreaking LawWhy There's No Trump Bump For Infrastructure StocksCheck Out These 4 Energy Plays Near Buy Zones

1002,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

Most markets in Asia and Europe also retreated.Mueller is probing whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice, the Washington Post reported Wednesday evening later corroborated by several other media outlets. That's part of his expanding investigation that initially focused on whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia officials over meddling with the 2016 presidential election.Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department to take over the Russia probe in the furor following Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.Separate reports said that Trump recently had considered firing Mueller, Comey's predecessor at the FBI.Trump took to Twitter Thursday morning criticizing the alleged probe.They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story.

Dow futures declined 0.3% below fair value.X On Wednesday, stocks closed mixed following the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and hawkish outlook. Financials rallied into the close, with Citigroup (C) and Comerica (CMA) holding buy points while Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and American Express (AXP) are near entries.During Wednesday's regular session, the Dow industrials hit a record high early and rallied to close up 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% as Apple (AAPL) and other big-cap techs resumed their retreat. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1%, with energy stocks tumbling with oil prices.Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and many other financials are once again looking better, investors should be cautious. First, the market uptrend is under pressure, which means being wary of making new bets of any kind. Meanwhile, the relative strength lines of bank stocks are largely moving sideways with the S&P 500. That's been trend for many years. Banks may outperform for brief periods, but generally move with the broader market.IBD'S TAKE: Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are all part of IBD's Money Center group. To see how they stack up against one another and against objective criteria, go to IBD's Stock Checkup.Citigroup broke past a 62.63 flat base buy point last week, and has held on this week. Citi fell to 63.50 intraday, but rebounded to close up 3 cents at 63.72.On Tuesday, Citi became the latest Wall Street giant to warn of weak Q2 trading revenues.Bank of America regained its 50-day moving average on Monday, but tested that support Wednesday. By the close, BofA lost just a penny, at 23.76. The stock has a potential aggressive buy point of 24.45, with a conventional flat base entry of 25.90.JPMorgan Chase also tested its recently recaptured 50-day line Wednesday, but closed at 87.09, down just 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average component has an 89.23 double-bottom buy point in play.American Express, also a Dow component and the lone credit card play on this list, rallied to close up 0.3% at 80.84. American Express has an 82.10 buy point in sight.Comerica, a superregional bank, cleared a 73.51 entry on Tuesday. On Wednesday, shares dropped to 72.59 intraday before reversing higher for a 0.5% gain at 74.26.The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it will keep raising rates and will begin to rein in its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end. Investors took that as a sign that interest rates will rise and spreads will widen, which would bolster banks' profits. Meanwhile, the Fed will issue stress test results on key financials later this month, following up with its appraisal of dividend and buyback plans. Banks are expected to have little trouble with those oversight exams. Any negative surprises, or unexpectedly big shareholder return programs, could swing individual stocks.In Asia, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.3%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 sank 1.2%. China's Shanghai composite edged up 0.1% but Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 1.2%.In Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.8% intraday as a divided Bank of England left interest rates unchanged.

1005,MS,"X Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and other notable bank stocks rebounded in afternoon trading following the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and unexpectedly hawkish outlook.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America fell 1% or more leading up to the Fed decision on the stock market today, while Goldman Sachs off less than 1% ahead of the central bank's statement.But banks rebounded as the Fed still expects to raise rates again in 2017, with three more in 2018. Policymakers also laid out plans for paring its balance sheet.JPMorgan and Goldman, both Dow Jones industrial average components, along with Bank of America, found support at their 50-day moving averages, JPMorgan closed down just 0.2% while BofA lost a penny, while Goldman advanced 1%. Citigroup rebounded to trade up 3 ents, still in buy range from last week's breakout. Morgan Stanley sank 0.5% to 44.91, off lows of 44.22, but just below a 44.96 buy point taken Tuesday.Comerica (CMA), a superregional bank that retook a 73.51 buy point on Tuesday, rose 0.5% to 74.26 after dropping to 72.59 intraday.The Fed is expected to raise interest rates for a second time this year on Wednesday, but investors are looking for hints on future moves. A surprisingly weak brace of reports on retail sales and consumer prices suggest that policymakers may be more cautious about a third hike in 2017. The 10-year Treasury yield sank to 2017 lows on those reports, but rallied off the day's worst levels after the Fed decisionOn Tuesday, Citigroup said Q2 trading revenue is likely to fall 12%-13%, in line with what Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase said last month. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have also hinted at weak trading.Stocks which were little changed before the Fed meeting, retreated following the announcement, especially after Fed chief Janet Yellen began speaking.

1006,MS,"Citigroup (C) on Tuesday became the latest bank to warn of a slower trading environment and low volatility — the same conditions that have bruised Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks.Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference, Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said he expected that fixed-income, currencies and commodities revenue as well as equities trading revenue combined could be down around 12%-13%.That forecast would be comparable to those offered by JPMorgan and Bank of America (BAC) last month. Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs also have said they were seeing weaker trading revenue.But shares of Citigroup were up 0.6% at 64.69 in the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last week as markets expect another rate hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. Citi is at its best levels since early 2009.Morgan Stanley rose 0.7% to 45.17, closing above a 44.96 cup-with-handle buy point after crossing the entry intraday in the prior two sessions. Morgan Stanley's volume was only about average, though.Bank of America fell 1 cent to 23.77, while JPMorgan added 0.4% and Goldman Sachs rose 1%. All are above their 50-day moving averages and are building the right side of bases.The weaker trends in the second quarter come a year after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union and a tumultuous U.S. election led to massive market turnover.While bank stocks stand to benefit from higher interest rates, they've been gridlocked as Wall Street waits for the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress to push through bank-friendly legislation such as tax and regulatory reform.The Federal Reserve is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. With another rate hike widely expected Wednesday afternoon, Wall Street will likely turn its attention to how bullish the central bank will be on rates for the rest of the year.Goldman's trading woes actually started earlier than Q2. In contrast to Citigroup, JPMorgan and BofA, the investment bank saw Q1 trading revenue drop on a mix of subdued client activity, politics and misplaying the market.RELATED:Dow's JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo To Report Q1: What To Watch5 Bank Stocks Just Below Buy Points: Investing Action Plan

1008,MS,"What would have happened if a Trump supporter had shot a Democratic congressman and other Democratic Washington officials?The answer is obvious.The New York Times, the rest of the left-wing media and the Democratic Party would have made the shootings the dominant issue in American life. It is not possible to understand the left — and, therefore, the media and the current state of American life — without understanding how the left uses and relies on hysteria. Hysteria is to the left as oxygen is to biological life.From the moment Donald Trump was elected president, America has been drowning in left-wing hysteria, all fomented by the media and the Democratic Party.The charge of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign is hysteria. The claim that the president engaged in obstruction of justice is hysteria. As I have pointed out, the charge of Trump's election unleashing hate and anti-Semitism, which dominated American media for months, was hysteria.If Democrats had been shot by a Trump supporter, all you would be hearing and reading about is how much hate the Trump election has unleashed in America, how his election is threatening our democracy and how he is unleashing fascism.But it was a not a Trump supporter who attempted to murder a Democratic congressman, Capitol Police officers, a House GOP aide and a lobbyist; it was a Trump-hating leftist who attempted to murder a Republican congressman and other Republican officials. And, for that reason, what would have been the dominant issue in America today is already a nonissue. The shooting took place on Wednesday. On Friday, the only article about it on The New York Times front page was about the ""harmony"" engulfing Democrats and Republicans in the wake of the shooting. By Saturday, there was nothing about the shooting on the front page.The ""harmony"" issue is worth noting. As sure as the sun rises in the east, had a Trump-supporting fanatic shot Democratic officials, the Democrats would not have said a word about the need for ""harmony,"" or the need to lower the temperature in American political discourse. On the contrary, they would have greatly raised the temperature of their already blistering rhetoric. They would have attributed the shooting entirely to Trump's ""hateful"" rhetoric having permeated conservative and Republican America.But it was a leftist who attempted to slaughter Republicans, so it was Republicans who had to respond. And they did so by calling for harmony and lowering the temperature of political differences.In other words, Republicans reacted with complete conciliation, whereas, the Democrats and their media would have gone ballistic against the right.Now, why is that?One reason is that Republicans have accepted the post-shooting narrative of there being some sort of moral equivalence between right-wing and left-wing hate. That they have reinforces my belief that the great majority of Republicans and conservatives, whether in politics or in the media, do not appreciate how rotten the left is (the left — not traditional liberals). Many really believe that calls for ""harmony"" and ""unity"" with Democrats and the left are meaningful.But the only reason Democrats talked about harmony for a few days after the shooting was one of theirs was the shooter.Even during the three-day ""harmony"" period, the left was busy furthering the falsehood that there is quantitative and qualitative equivalence between right-wing and left-wing hate. As evidence, a New York Times editorial said: ""Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl. At the time, we and others were sharply critical of the heated political rhetoric on the right. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map that showed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.""A Republican putting crosshairs on vulnerable Democrat districts is the worst the Times could come up with. And that is apparently equivalent to all the hate directed at President Trump: calling opposition to him ""resistance,"" as if Democrats were the French resistance and Trump were a Nazi; Kathy Griffin holding President Trump's mock severed head with blood gushing out; Stephen Colbert saying on his TV show that Trump's mouth would make a good ""c--- holster"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin; and so much more unprecedented hate.The difference between what has happened after these shootings and what would have happened had a right-winger shot Democratic officials is, in a nutshell, the moral difference between the left and the right; and between Democrats and Republicans.RELATED:What 'Line' Did Kathy Griffin Cross, Exactly?Your Tax Dollars At Work: Subsidizing Elite Colleges That Produce Intolerant BigotsAs Steve Scalise Shooting Shows, Left's Rhetoric Of Anger And Hate Has Gotten Out Of Hand

1009,MS,"Shares of Morgan Stanley (MS) are near an aggressive buy point Friday, as market relief following the Week Of Comey also helped JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) retake key support levels.It followed Thursday's action on Capitol Hill, where House Republicans passed a bill that would drive a stake through the heart of the Dodd-Frank financial reform measures. However, the bill's prospects in the Senate are much dimmer.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with another rate hike almost certain — making it easier for banks to pass costs onto their own borrowers and boost profits. However, questions remain about how aggressive the central bank will be on rates in the months that follow.Shares of Morgan Stanley were up 1.8% at 44.91 on the stock market today, just below an aggressive buy point of 44.96 within a bigger consolidation. The traditional buy point of that pattern, begun in March, is 47.33.JPMorgan rallied 2.4%, and Bank of America added 3.05%, with both climbing back above their 50-day averages, a key test of investors' confidence in a stock. Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.7%, just above its 50-day line. Citigroup (C) gained 2%, continuing its climb past a flat base with a 62.63 buy point, helped by an upgrade from UBS.The gains came a day after markets took the testimony of former FBI director James Comey in stride.Some observers said Comey, in detailing his interactions with President Trump and Trump's alleged attempts to interfere with an investigation into his team's possible ties with Russia, was laying the groundwork for an obstruction-of-justice case.And while he offered color to what has already been reported about the matter, he offered no new bombshell revelations, at least not publicly.RELATED:Blue Chips Lead As Financials Jump; Nvidia's Surge Continues

1013,MS,"Citigroup (C) shares broke out on Thursday, with global and regional banks also trying to reclaim key support levels.The gains came as the House was set Thursday to pass a rollback of Dodd-Frank financial reform measures and as former FBI Director James Comey offered no additional bombshells during his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Early Thursday, the European Central Bank dropped a pledge to ease policy if necessary.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up 1 basis point to 2.19% following modest gains on Wednesday. Shares of Citigroup rallied 2.15% to 63.21, clearing a 62.63 buy point from a flat base. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) climbed 1.2%, nearing its 50-day line as it grinds through a double-bottom base. Bank of America (BAC), up 1.6%, was also close to that key test of investor support. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 1.9% as it makes its way through a consolidation.

Among superregionals, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% and US Bancorp (USB) added 1.3%, both retaking their 50-day lines.After a long postelection sprint, bank stocks began leveling off in March amid concerns the Trump administration's agenda of tax and regulatory reform was stalling.Bank stocks, and markets more broadly, have also been pressured amid the escalating drama over the government's investigations into Russia's meddling in the U.S. November election and the Trump camp's potential ties to Russia.Comey, whom Trump fired last month as he was seeking more resources for the FBI's own investigation into Russian interference, has been a central figure in that drama.In his prepared remarks released on Wednesday, he appeared to relieve markets, as they largely confirmed what had already been reported.On Thursday, Comey didn't drop any new revelations. But he suggested some damaging details might be revealed in a closed-door session and ratcheted up the rhetoric, saying the Trump administration had tried to ""defame"" him and the FBI with ""lies"" and that Trump's ""shifting explanations"" over his firing had made him more concerned.He also said no other person he had worked for while in government had asked him for ""loyalty"" in the way Trump had, and that he began documenting a January meeting with Trump out of concern Trump might lie about it.But he was mum on the details contained in the dossier compiled by former intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and whether Trump's remarks to him amounted to obstruction of justice.Meanwhile, the GOP-led House approved legislation to roll back many Dodd-Frank provisions. But getting 60 votes in the Senate will be a huge hurdle, so it's unclear how much investors were buying banks based on the House vote.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA Hit On Latest Bad News For BanksAs JPMorgan, BofA Struggle, This Regional Bank Tries To Move Up

1017,MS,"Celgene (CELG) stock dipped to a four-month low Monday on Wall Street disappointment that its potential blockbuster drug, ozanimod, failed to delay the accumulation of physical disabilities in multiple sclerosis patients compared with interferon.But ozanimod did meet its primary goal, reducing annual relapse rates for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Celgene said in a news statement it plans to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year.On the stock market today, Celgene stock was down 1% to 115.71, after earlier falling as much as 2.8% to touch a low last seen Jan. 31. Shares began forming a flat base in mid-March, but dropped below the lower level on Monday. Rival Novartis (NVS) stock was up 1.1%, near 81.29.Ozanimod was compared to FDA-approved interferon Avonex in a two-year trial of 1,313 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Both 0.5-milligram and 1-mg doses of ozanimod demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in annual relapse rates.Celgene's drug also reduced new or enlarging lesions over two years vs. Avonex. But, in a pooled analysis of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of ozanimod, the drug failed to show a statistically significant improvement on disability vs. Avonex. That could put it at a disadvantage to Novartis' Gilenya.IBD'S TAKE: Can't seem to get a handle on the biotech market? Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at what can be a complex sector — and why your best stock bets this year might not be the biggest names in the game.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges doesn't expect the disability point to hamper ozanimod's approval. Safety was similar in this trial to an earlier Phase 3 study of ozanimod, Celgene said. Full results will be presented at a future medical conference.""While the lack of disability benefit is disappointing, we do not believe it will limit ozanimod's chances for approval given the significance and clinical benefit of the primary endpoint,"" he wrote in a note to clients.However, it will limit ozanimod in its competition vs. Novartis' Gilenya, Porges said. Like ozanimod, Gilenya belongs to a class of drugs that modulate a specific receptor to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis. Gilenya is approved with a note indicating it can delay the accumulation of physical disability.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat called the disability question ""the No. 1 investor focus"" for Celgene's trial, dubbed Radiance. Still, those expectations were displaced, Raffat wrote in a note to clients. Novartis' rival drug Gilenya never showed an ""extraordinary"" statistically significant disability benefit vs. Avonex.The bigger question for ozanimod is whether Gilenya remains branded in 2019 as generic competitors creep begin looking at the market. There's a ""realistic chance"" that Gilenya remains unchallenged by generics, though, as a number of important patents are in place.Celgene and Novartis will also have to contend with Roche which recently grabbed approval for its ""game changer"" multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus. Ocrevus alone is approved for both forms of multiple sclerosis — relapsing-remitting and primary progressive.RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisDid Regeneron, Sanofi Just Launch A Blockbuster Drug?How Celgene Toppled On A Small-Cap Biotech's Ragged Quarter

1018,MS,"X Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and other bank stocks led markets lower on Wednesday, with investor support failing amid reports of weaker second-quarter trading revenue.Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan, at separate conferences on Wednesday, both said they expected Q2 trading revenue to be slower this year.JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake, citing less volatility, said the company's Q2 trading revenue has so far been 15% lower than a year earlier and was unlikely to change, reports said. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said trading results for the quarter would also be worse. Late Wednesday, Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg Television ""are reflecting reality and I don't think we're very different.""The remarks come as the Trump economic agenda — including tax reform — continues to be eclipsed by investigations over Russian interference in the U.S. election and the administration's possible ties to that nation. Analysts have said any further run-up in bank stocks could be hamstrung until Congress gets more work done.Goldman Sachs (GS), whose first-quarter earnings were dinged by sluggish trading and cautiousness over the political climate, was down 3.3% on the stock market today, dipping below its 200-day average for the first time in eight months. JPMorgan fell 2.1%, puncturing the bottom of a flat base. Bank of America lost 2.2%, undercutting the bottom of its own flat base.The declines in Goldman and JPMorgan accounted for all of the Dow's 0.1% retreat and more.Citigroup (C) dropped 1.8%, after flirting with a breakout last week. Citigroup is still above its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley eased 1.3%, losing sight of its 50-day.As bank stocks fell, the Relative Strength lines of the banks crumbled to their lowest levels since early November. Bank stocks went on a tear following President Trump's election, with the hopes that economic growth would push up wages, rates and inflation — all things that banks tend to like.The 10-year Treasury yield — a measure of inflation expectations that also influences rates on different types of credit — slipped 1 basis point to 2.21% on Wednesday. The yield curve between short-term and long-term yields is flattening, with the Federal Reserve expected to raise short-term rates in June.RELATED:JPMorgan CEO Signals Patience As Trump's Growth Agenda StallsFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank Stocks

1019,MS,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were higher early Wednesday, signaling little change at the opening bell.The major averages edged lower in Tuesday's stock market trading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite snapping seven-day winning streaks. Several big-cap tech giants hit fresh all-time highs, but bank stocks were among the notable losers, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC). Citigroup (C) also edged lower, but remains in relatively sound shape.XDow industrials futures rose a fraction above fair value, S&P 500 futures also edged up while Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1%. U.S. crude oil futures fell nearly 2% to below $49 a barrel amid renewed oversupply concerns.Bank stocks were big leaders of the so-called Trump rally following the presidential election. But the stocks have struggled for several months. Here are four reasons to look beyond the banks to other sectors.Dow industrials component JPMorgan Chase narrowly avoided undercutting the low of its base Tuesday, setting a four-month closing low. JPMorgan Chase, fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are all below their downwardly sloping 50-day moving averages, with Wells Fargo (WFC) under its 200-day for good measure.Relative strength lines, which track how stocks perform vs. the S&P 500, highlight how financials have lagged in 2017. JPMorgan's RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since Election Day, with other banks' RS lines showing similar weakness.Citigroup is an exception. Citi is just below a 62.63 buy point in a flat base, and is still in range from an aggressive entry at 60.89. Citi's RS line isn't great but has risen fractionally over the past four months.IBD'S TAKE: Every day the market is full of noise. So what should you focus on? IBD's Investing Action Plan highlights top earnings reports, stock near entries and key economic data for the coming day. In the latest action plan, we highlight three stocks in buy range with earnings due Wednesday.A big reason why bank stocks, and the overall market, rallied on Trump's election was the prospect of tax cuts and other pro-growth measures. But Trump has been embroiled in troubles, distracting the White House and sapping his political capital. Republicans are divided on key issues, including how much to cut and how to offset the lost revenue, if at all. Wall Street appears to be pricing-out prospects for major tax reform, at least in 2017.Bank executives, and perhaps investors, are still hopeful that the Trump administration will ease financial regulatory burdens that limit lending and buybacks.Stronger economic growth should spur demand for loans, but it also should encourage higher interest rates and wider spreads between banks' short-term funding costs and long-term lending rates. Yield spreads widened after the election. But with the Federal Reserve raising short-term official rates and the 10-year Treasury yield sliding toward 2017 lows, the yield curve is the flattest in seven months. That's bad news for banks' net interest margins and not a great sign for the economy either.Bank stocks are going through a lull right now. Perhaps they'll turn around soon. But looking at long-term charts, bank stocks haven't really outperformed the S&P 500 for long stretches, even well-run operations such as JPMorgan. Bank stocks have had short-term outperformance, such as in last few months of 2016, but banks are not secular market leaders.If investors want to follow the market, buying a broad index mutual fund or ETF (with banks a significant part of the holdings) can do that without the sector risk.Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1%. China's Shanghai composite, which had been closed on Tuesday, rose 0.2% after climbing much more earlier on a report indicating steady manufacturing growth.In Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.3% intraday, Germany's Dax 0.2% and France's CAC-40 edged higher.RELATED:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisThe Big Picture: Large Cap Techs Vs.

Bank groups have been trending lower for several months.On Friday, the Labor Department reported that only 138,000 jobs were added in May, below the 190,000 jobs Wall Street expected. While the unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low, it was due to workers leaving the labor force.While stock surged on the news, so did Treasuries. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to their lowest levels of the year. Meanwhile, analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates on June 14.That further flattened the yield curve, meaning banks will see lower net interest margins from lending.Investors will bullish on banks after President Trump's election in the hopes that his proposed tax cuts and other pro-growth agenda items would spur  economic growth, expanding lending and the yield curve.

1023,MS,"The Federal Reserve isn't quite ready to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, minutes from the May 2-3 meeting released on Wednesday signal.While policymakers continue to think it will likely be ""appropriate to begin reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings this year,"" Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs had begun looking for a shift as early as September. Now that seems unlikely to happen so quickly.Perhaps even more important than the timing of the reinvestment shift is the ""low"" scale of the initial balance sheet reductions envisioned by the Fed.As Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson explained, committee members endorsed ""a staff paper proposing that the balance sheet roll-off should begin at a 'low' pace, increased gradually  every three months, circumstances permitting."" Shepherdson sees the Fed beginning to let maturing principal run-off from the portfolio as early as October, but at a level that won't fray investors' nerves.After the release, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite added to their modest gains on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 coming just short of a newall-time high. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and other banks stocks whose net interest margins can be sensitive to interest-rate changes remained fractionally mixed following the release. JPMorgan and BofA fell 0.1% while Citigroup (C) neared a buy point.Reinvestment has kept the Fed's balance sheet steady in recent years. A decision not to reinvest maturing bonds would act as a monetary tightening.JPMorgan economists highlighted a possibility that the Fed will pause hiking rates if core inflation readings continue to come in on the soft side, as they have the past two months.But Fed policymakers signaled they see a rate hike ""soon,"" backing up expectations for June hike.After release of the March minutes, which policymakers first stated the a reinvestment policy shift would be appropriate this year, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index turned negative. Bank of America and Dow component JPMorgan fell more than 1% that day, while fellow Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup reversed lower as markets were caught off guard by the Fed discussion.Prior Fed comments have made pretty clear that the central bank won't spring a sudden change on the market —  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, a voting member of the FOMC policy committee, said he wants to make balance sheet reductions like ""watching paint dry.""If policymakers wanted to telegraph that such a change might be forthcoming within the next few meetings, the minutes would be the place to do so.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks, one of the big winners of the initial Trump postelection rally, continue to lag their 50-day moving averages, a signal of technical weakness. After last week's market plunge on rising political uncertainty, the stock market uptrend is under pressure, a status that advises investors to exercise more caution when buying stocks. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture every day to stay on top of the market trend.How markets will react to the change when it happens isn't exactly clear. Goldman Sachs sees the announcement of balance sheet adjustment as ""a smaller tightening step"" than the Fed's typical 25-basis-point rate hike, Goldman's chief U.S. economist, Jan Hatzius, explained recently.Goldman has been expecting rate hikes in June and again in September, then a balance sheet tightening in December. But the recent run of weaker inflation readings suggests that the Fed might hold off hiking rates in September and instead announce a more market-friendly balance sheet adjustment, Hatzius said last week.Before the Fed minutes' release, markets were pricing in an 83% chance of a June hike and 50-50 odds for the subsequent hike coming in January 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.Interpreting the impact of a shift in the reinvestment policy isn't crystal clear. Fed Chair Janet Yellen explained in January that the 10-year Treasury yield could rise by 15 basis points over the course of 2017 as ""the end-date for reinvestment draws closer."" She noted that such a change in longer-term yields is roughly the same historical impact of two 25-basis-point hikes in the federal funds rate.Bank investors weren't too concerned heading into Wednesday's Fed minutes release, with Morgan Stanley (MS) and most other banks stocks little changed after all rose more than 1% Tuesday. JPMorgan, Goldman and Morgan Stanley moved toward their 50-day moving averages, while BofA flirted with taking that key level. Citigroup, which fell below an aggressive buy point in the May 17 selloff, retook that entry last Friday and is near record highs.RELATED:Fed Holds Rates Steady, Gives Markets Breathing RoomHow The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting Stocks

JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said caution on an OK-but-not-great economy and an absence of ""idiosyncratic events"" had led to quieter market activity.

1027,MS,"It has been interesting to see how the United States observed the recent South Korean election. Americans mostly viewed the election as a barometer for future policy toward the North: Would South Korea elect a conservative candidate to get tough with Kim Jong-un? With North Korea's saber-rattling across the Pacific, safety in Asia was America's No. 1 concern.But South Korean voters saw it differently.For them, economic matters mattered more. Only 18.5% of South Korea's voters in a pre-election survey said national security was the most important issue, putting it at No. 3, with the economy at No. 2 (24.5%) and government corruption at No. 1 (27.5%) – a natural concern given that their country has not had a president since December because she was impeached on corruption charges. Left-wing reform candidate Moon Jae-in had the clear inside track to electoral success given the circumstances.In December, while Americans were still doing our own political post-mortems, South Korean President Park Geun-hye was impeached because her administration stood accused of taking bribes from large South Korean companies, including Samsung, Hyundai, Lotte Group, SK Group, and others. Ms. Park's trial is underway. Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong was arrested in February and his trial is underway as well.Meanwhile Samsung is facing an uncertain future with its leader sitting in a jail cell and the inherent challenges of staying competitive with Apple and other leaders in the tech space. It's safe to say that Mr. Lee's absence could eventually deal a serious blow to Samsung – the largest driver of the South Korean economy.Samsung alone comprises 20% of the South Korean economy, or as the Atlantic magazine put it a few years ago, ""Whoa: Samsung Is Responsible for 20% (!?) of South Korea's Economy."" Samsung is to South Korea what Disney is to Florida — except about 10 times bigger. At that scale, it's safe to say that as Samsung goes, so goes South Korea.Thus, both are in trouble with the aggressive anti-big-business reform agenda that the new administration has promised. President Moon campaigned on rooting out corruption in government and big businesses, or the ""chaebols,"" and with his victory Koreans may learn a hard lesson: Liberal economic reforms and breaking up successful businesses could weaken South Korean companies and make it harder for them to compete globally.To translate this into American politics: The Republican Party took a bath in the 1974 Congressional elections and lost the presidency in 1976 because people were upset with Watergate, not because they thought Jimmy Carter was best suited to handle the USSR. Park is like Nixon except instead of a wiretapping and cover-up, she is accused of corruption and bribery. Moon represents to most people a chance to move forward.President Moon vows to take on the chaebols, similar to how the so-called ""Watergate babies,"" the liberal reformers who came to Congress after Nixon resigned, upended government and business practices alike, ushering in new regulations, transparency rules and oversight. But within a few years, American businesses found themselves hamstrung and average Americans were paying higher taxes for a growing bureaucracy in place to check the power of big corporations.By 1980, the combination of economic stagnation and inflation, or ""stagflation,"" was too much and Americans turned to business-friendly Ronald Reagan. By 1984, it was ""morning in America"" once again.Moon's crusade on corporate corruption will certainly please skeptics of the U.S. free trade agreement with South Korea. The Trump administration has already questioned whether the agreement has been good for the U.S. We can debate the merits of trade between the U.S. and disparate economies like China or Mexico, which can displace working class jobs, but we shouldn't have to with South Korea. We are both advanced, stable economies with similar political and legal systems.Despite this, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with South Korea had doubled since the South Korean FTA went into effect five years ago.  Look for this imbalance to change at South Korea's detriment if President Moon takes on the chaebol system too aggressively and too quickly.Given the size and reach of the chaebols, any setbacks will come with great cost to South Korean businesses and create new openings for foreign competitors. South Korea should be wary of these unintended consequences. Whether Moon succeeds in replacing his country's unique system with something that works better, or simply blows up in their faces, will not be known for years.

1028,MS,"Total prescriptions of Pfizer (PFE) eczema drug Eucrisa have flattened out over recent weeks as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent has picked up steam, according to data from health care tracker MS.After a meteoric rise to 3,500 prescriptions nine weeks after Eucrisa's launch, scripts of the topical eczema ointment have tallied between 3,000 and 4,000 over the past eight weeks. Injection Dupixent has yet to see a dip, hitting 807 prescriptions by week nine.Pfizer attributes the flatter trend to a decrease in free trial vouchers for Eucrisa, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a research report. Pfizer estimates a third of total scripts for Eucrisa are from the free trial vouchers.Still ""Eucrisa total prescriptions excluding free trial vouchers are growing well — up 13% in the most recent rolling four weeks vs. the previous four weeks while free trial voucher prescriptions were down 18% in the same period,"" Raffat said.IBD'S TAKE: At least one analyst is predicting another boom in biotech. But it won't be the big names leading the charge, he says. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at which stocks look strong this year.But demand looks likely to continue on an upward trend for Dupixent, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said, citing four physicians working in dermatology.""The biggest takeaways from our discussions were the consistent suggestion that these physicians believe the moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis population is as large or larger than the moderate-to-severe psoriasis population,"" he said.Each physician interviewed expects to start 10-15 patients on Dupixent by year's end.""Physicians would not comment if Dupixent's use in (eczema) could be similar to the percentage of patients who receive biologics treatment for psoriasis,"" he said. ""But (they) believed it had huge potential as physicians gained comparable experience.""Overall, an average 60%-70% of eczema patients seen by the four doctors were adults. But Dupixent has the potential to be a game-changer in pediatric eczema, Porges said. Children are likely to be on the drug longer-term than adults.""The physicians believed 30% of moderate-to-severe (eczema) pediatrics experienced continuing disease into adulthood which they now recognize is associated with more complex multisystem disease than they previously appreciated,"" he said.Dupixent is currently approved only for adults, though is in clinical testing in children.RELATED:IBD 50 Stock Veeva Flies To Record High On 'Another Exceptional Quarter'Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie in Rheumatoid Arthritis

1029,MS,"Bank stocks, among the biggest winners since Donald Trump's election, were among the biggest losers as the president's political woes intensified. Citigroup (C) fell back below a buy point, while Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and several other big financials undercut key support levels. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both members of the Dow Jones industrial average, tumbled below the low of their current consolidations.Stocks sold off Wednesday on news reports that Trump pressured then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of Mike Flynn, who was briefly the president's national security advisor. Trump abruptly fired Comey last week.While social media is rampant with chatter of impeachment, markets are worried about more realistic scenarios. Trump's agenda for tax cuts and other pro-growth ideas already seem stalled. As a result, the odds of Federal Reserve rate hikes are falling. Treasury yields are sinking, with the yield curve flattening out once again. Bank executives and shareholders have been counting on stronger economic growth to boost lending — and widen the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates.The Trump administration could still go forward with regulatory relief for banks. But even that could be delayed or scaled back as the president and top officials are occupied putting out political fires of his own making.Citigroup last week cleared an aggressive buy point at 60.89. On Tuesday, shares ran up to just below a convention buy point of 62.63. But Citigroup tumbled 4% to 59.98 on the stock market today, back below the alternative entry though finding some support at its 50-day moving average.Bank of America, which had just gotten above its 50-day line, fell 5.9%. Morgan Stanley, off 5.6%, also broke through that support level and is on track for a 2017 closing low. Citizens Financial Group (CFG) (-6.8%), KeyCorp (KEY) (-4.8%) and Comerica (CMA) (-5.6%) were among several other financials piercing through their 50-day lines.The Dow's JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, already on the wrong side of the 50-day line, fell 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Both fell intraday below the low end of their base patterns.Wells Fargo (WFC), which can't shake the fake accounts scandal, lost 1.9%, closing just below its 200-day line.RELATED:Trump Will Bust Up Bank Regulation, Not The BanksThese Words Could Doom Trump's Tax Cuts
"
1030,MS,"Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) and Depomed (DEPO) stocks plunged Thursday after a Mizuho analyst slashed her price targets on a slew of drugmakers including No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler cited risky guidance for her price-target cuts on Teva and Depomed stocks. She is more bullish on Dermira (DERM), a skin-care firm, but trimmed her price target on prescription trends in dermatology. Eagle stock, meanwhile, is too ""expensive,"" she said.On the stock market today, Depomed stock fell 2.3% to 10.39 and Eagle 3.3% to 73.89. Teva stock lost 0.9% to 28.71, but Dermira stock rose 1.2% to 27.85. Koffler sees Dermira as a takeout candidate in 2018.Koffler cut her price target on Teva stock to 25 from 29, and kept her underperform rating. She cited ""expectations of contraction via further asset sales, general pricing pressure, Copaxone (issues) and minimal pipeline contribution.""She removed sales of laquinimod from her model. Laquinimod was being developed to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but failed in a recent trial, forcing Teva to focus instead on laquinimod in primary-progressive MS and Huntington's disease.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with the drugmaking industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Meanwhile, Teva is likely to experience more pressure against its blockbuster MS drug Copaxone. In January, a district court judge tossed out four of five patents protecting the drug, opening Teva up to competition from Mylan (MYL), Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA).Koffler kept a neutral rating on Depomed stock, but cut her price target to 11 from 13, noting a weak long-term outlook in the opioid market. Depomed makes pain-management drugs including Nucynta.Though first-quarter sales and profits missed expectations, Koffler likes ""the pragmatism of new CEO Arthur Higgins, who made rapid decisions to stabilize product declines and lower operating expenses."" Lowered guidance for 2017 now feels more achievable, she said.Eagle stock, on the other hand, is just too expensive, Koffler wrote in a note to clients. It's unlikely to be a takeout candidate in 2017, so Koffler cut her price target on shares to 57 from 66. Like Teva, Eagle stock also has an underperform rating.For the first quarter, Eagle reported consensus-topping revenue and profits that met. But Koffler lowered her expectations of a 2017 takeout to 20% from 40%, noting uncertainties associated with its chemotherapy Bendeka and a likely slow ramp for Ryanodex in exertional heat stroke.But Dermira grabbed bullish views. Prescription trends in dermatology are currently soft, so Koffler cut her price target on Dermira stock to 40 from 42, though she is buy-rated on shares noting she views ""the company as an attractive 2018 takeout candidate.""Dermira stock sold off recently after an unexpected convertible debt financing, but Koffler expects the stock to rebound on its ""innovative pipeline"" and the potential for a takeout. The stock now looks derisked from any additional financing in the next year, she said in a note.RELATED:Did Neurocrine Just Leave The Door Open For Teva In Tourette's?Can Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To MarketTeva Pharma Q1 Sales Lag As key Multiple Sclerosis Drug Topples

1037,MS,"Average pay in the financial advisor industry overall is OK, but hardly mind-blowing. As IBD has reported, the average annual salary of personal financial advisors hit $118,050 in 2015, according to careertrends.com. That topped 90% of all occupations' salaries.But look what happens to financial advisors' compensation figures when you check out paychecks beyond America's multitude of small mom-and-pop financial advisors and beyond young newcomers to the field, whether they toil on Wall Street or Main Street. Top yearly base compensation at regional broker-dealers and wirehouses ranges from $140,000 for financial advisors at UBS whose 2017 production will be $400,000, to $1,105,000 for Raymond James & Associates financial advisors whose production this year hits $2 million, according to a new survey by the publication On Wall Street.On Wall Street's data include pay for financial advisors with 10 years of service. The firm combines cash pay and deferred compensation, and it excludes any bonus financial advisors may earn or performance penalty they may incur. It also excludes any company match to 401(k) or other profit-sharing plans.Further, it assumes that a financial advisor's production — products and services sold to clients — is in the form of individual stocks, bonds, mutual funds and fee-based services such as wrap accounts and managed accounts, with each of those accounting for 25% of the advisor's business. What happens if one of those is less than 25%? It's not counted?The On Wall Street results show compensation ranging from 35% of production for a $400,000 producer at UBS to 55% of production for a $2 million producer at Raymond James.In between, On Wall Street's survey details compensation for $600,000 producers and $1 million producers.""I think some firms would pay a higher percentage if you were, say, a $5 million producer,"" On Wall Street senior editor Andrew Welsch told IBD.In the survey, the cash portion — called cash grid — ranges from a low of 66.6% of total compensation for Edward Jones to 100% of total compensation for several firms at several levels of production. In most cases, cash accounted for about 83% to 98% of total compensation.The data divides pay into cash and deferred portions. ""Cash is what you get paid upfront,"" Welsch said. ""Some more cynical people might call the deferred compensation golden handcuffs because you must stay at the firm to get that at some time in the future.""Welsch added: ""Some wirehouses increase the deferred part of the equation. They say it helps them balance their (profit-and-loss statement) and offset costs. Their argument is that it allows them to pay advisors more in theory, because more of the pay is deferred. A cynical advisor would say they are just taking that from the cash component. You've got to wait for the deferred part to vest.""The compensation data shows a trend over the years regarding break points where advisors' compensation rises based on production. ""Pay is staying roughly the same, but the thresholds (for break points) keep moving back,"" he said. ""The firms are moving the goal posts. If you want to earn the same amount as in previous years, you have to produce more. You must do more business to earn the same take-home pay.""For financial firms, moving those break points back can become a game of chicken with financial advisors. ""Changes in the break points are one of the key reasons why advisors leave wirehouses and go to independent RIAs,"" Welsch said. ""They know exactly what they'll make there (at the RIA). At the wirehouses, there's always uncertainty about what the next year's (break points) will be.""Financial firms must carefully weigh how quickly to move those break points back. ""The changes are always small,"" Welsch said. ""They don't want to trigger a mass exodus of advisors.""Survey respondents included wirehouses — or full-service financial firms — Wells Fargo (WFC), UBS (UBS), Bank of America's[ticker symb=BAC] Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley (MS).Other regionals were RBC Wealth Management, Hilliard Lyons, Stifel, Janney Montgomery Scott, Wunderlich and Edward Jones.RELATED:How Much Is A Financial Advisor's Service Really Worth?How A Top Financial Advisor Turned A Lemon Investment Into A Sweet Career

Late Wednesday, Lululemon, (LULU) the maker and retailer of yoga and other athletic apparel, delivered weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings and guidance that fell short of expectations.

1043,MS,"Bank stocks such as Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) reversed Wednesday after the Federal Reserve hiked the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point but didn't give any signs that it would step up the pace of future hikes.The Fed indicated that there would be two more rate hikes this year, in line with earlier expectations. Markets had generally priced in a total of three hikes for 2017, but there had been some speculation that policymakers could shift to a four-hike path. Policymakers also see three increases next year.Higher rates help widen banks' net interest margins, allowing lenders to charge borrowers more interest and boosting bottom lines.The 10-year Treasury yield — which influences rates on different types of debt and is seen as a window into investor expectations of inflation — tumbled 9 basis points to 2.50% after running up in recent weeks ahead of the Fed meeting. The two-year yield fell 7 basis points to 1.31%.Shares of JPMorgan reversed from solid gains and briefly turned negative as yields fell and the curve flattened. JPMorgan closed up 0.2% on the stock market today.Most other bank stocks were in the red. Goldman Sachs dipped 0.4%. Bank of America (BAC), whose large U.S. operations make it more sensitive to rate fluctuations than other banks, turned negative, fell 0.6%.Citigroup (C) retreated 1%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 0.7% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are among the few to benefit when the Fed raises rates, since the extra costs ripple through to consumers. When consumers pay more on loans, that can help banks' net interest margins. The forecast follows a steep climb for banking stocks following President Trump's election, on the hopes for deregulation, inflation, and for the economic growth that could prompt the Fed to raise rates — one of the things the central bank does to keep the economy from overheating.RELATED:February Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, FedYellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017

1044,MS,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell slightly in Sunday evening trading. Dow futures edged down 0.1% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.2%.The major averages all rose slightly in the past week, with the Nasdaq composite briefly setting an all-time high on Friday.But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow industrials components, retreated last week, along with Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and a slew of other banks. Several bank stocks, notably Goldman and Morgan Stanley, are testing their 50-day moving averages.The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal faster interest rate hikes after Wednesday's expected quarter-point increase buoyed most stocks. But banks sold off as Treasury yields fell, especially at the high end. Lower yields and a flatter curve between short- and long-term maturities hurts banks' borrow short, lend long profit model.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks often are sensitive to interest rates swings, but not all: Here's a big-cap financial stock that in buy range now.JPMorgan, which gapped up at the beginning of March as investors priced in the March 15 Fed hike, fell about 1% in Friday stock market trading, essentially at its lowest levels of the month, but still not too close to its rising 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs sank 1.7% to 243.92 on Friday, closing just above its 50-day line. So did the other big pure-play investment bank Morgan Stanley, which retreated 2.8% Friday.Bank of America sank 1.4% on Friday, but is comfortably above its 50-day line. BofA tested its 50-day in early February, then had a solid advance through March 1.Citigroup, which was one of the few big banks to trade below its 50-day line earlier this year, fell 1.3% to 60.37 on Friday. Citigroup crossed a 61.73 buy point several times this month, but never closed above that level.PNC Financial (PNC) is approaching its 50-day line, Regions Financial (RF) briefly undercut that level on Friday, while BB&T Corp. (BBT), Keycorp (KEY) and Suntrust Financial (STI) all closed the week below that support area.Keep in mind that in most of these cases, the stock are not far multi-year highs.In Asian Monday intraday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose to its best levels since 2015.

"
1047,MS,"After a so-so 2016, MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has rediscovered its giddy-up. Some of that performance moxie can be credited to tech-sector top holdings like Facebook (FB) and financials that are top new buys, such as Morgan Stanley (MS).The $14.7 billion fund's 2.21% gain last year lagged 57% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 11.96% advance. That pales in comparison to this year's performance. Going into Friday, the fund is up 9.74%, ranking in the top 34% of its direct rivals and beating the big-cap bogey's 6.86%. That's pumped up balances in retirement accounts and other portfolios owned by this fund's shareholders.Several stocks driving the surge have high IBD ratings on fundamental and technical levels. Seven of its top-10 holdings as of Dec. 31 had Composite Ratings in the 80s or 90s from IBD. All four of the fund's top new buys as of that date also sported Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.With more than 25% of shareholder money at work in technology, that was the fund's largest sector as of Feb. 28. Top-10 holdings in the tech sector with Comp Ratings of 90 or higher were Facebook, which is up 22% so far this year, and Adobe Systems (ADBE), which is up 26%, including its 6% gap up Friday morning, the day after reporting first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe Systems is ranked No. 1 in the Computer Software-Desktop industry group. See how it stacks up against the Nos. 2 and 3 stocks on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Financials, with a weighting of about 11%, were Growth Fund's fourth-largest sector. Visa (V) was a top-10 holding in that space with a Comp in the 90s. It's up 15% this year.Top new buys in that high-Comps club were financials Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley. Goldman is up 4% this year. Morgan is up 10%.Commodity and specialty chemicals distributor Univar (UNVR), with a Comp of 90, was another top new buy. Shares are up 10%, even after pulling back 5% since March 1.Those top holdings and top new buys illustrate the appetite of managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel for stocks that can grow earnings no matter what's going on in the broader market and economy. ""We are long-term focused,"" Sabel explained in an earlier interview with IBD. ""We've held many of our names a long time. ... We may make some cyclical bets, but we really focus on secular growth stories.""The fund increased its share count in Facebook in November, December and January. Facebook is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Facebook earnings per share grew 94%, 91% and 78% the past three quarters. The social media giant's sales grew by more than 50% for each of the past five stanzas.The managers also boosted their share count in Adobe Systems in each of the three most recent months for which it has made disclosures. The digital media and marketing software firm's annual EPS has grown two years in a row. Ownership by mutual funds industrywide has increased for eight straight quarters. On Thursday, Adobe reported Q1 EPS growth of 42%. Q1 earnings of 94 cents beat analysts' expectations by 7 cents. Quarterly sales and cash flow also topped estimates.Portfolio newcomer Morgan Stanley posted EPS gains of 135% and 88% the past two quarters. Those followed two quarters of EPS declines. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters, after falling four frames in a row.Morgan Stanley is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center group, which in turn is ranked No. 16 out of 197. The stock has a sterling 98 Comp Rating. Morgan Stanley's wealth management wing plans to roll out a digital-only robo-advisor service later this year, aimed at the offspring of current clients. The news service also reports that Morgan Stanley is hiring hundreds of tech-savvy instructors to train its financial advisors on how to use new digital tools.The fund started its current stake in Univar in December. It boosted its modest initial share in January. The chemicals distributor has posted EPS growth of 422%, 89% and 1450% the past three quarters. EPS fell in four of the previous six quarters.In another move, MFS notified the Securities and Exchange Commission this week that it plans to add Paul Gordon to Growth's management team as of July 1. Gordon will remain the third manager of $2.2 billion MFS Mid Cap Growth (OTCAX), along with Fischman and Sabel. Both funds will then have the same trio of managers.""Given the similar approach across both funds, we feel it is appropriate to have the same team managing both, especially as we continue to see strong interest and flows in to both funds,"" said MFS spokesman Dan Flaherty.

1049,MS,"Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) woes are set to deepen in 2017 as generic-drug prices are projected to topple 7% to 10%, Argus analysts John Eade and Katelyn Bayone said Tuesday as they downgraded the stock.Shares are trading at 10-year lows after falling 7% over the past quarter, where the S&P 500 saw a 7% increase. Over the past year, Teva stock lost 38% as the index gained 21%, Argus analysts wrote. In the stock market today, Teva fell 1.1% to 35.02 and is right at its 50-day moving average, but the stock has been below its 200-day line for more than a year.Argus downgraded Teva stock to hold from buy, citing a ""plague"" of problems. Teva recently lost four of five patents protecting multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, and former CEO Erez Vigodman stepped down amid a DOJ investigation and bribery scandal in Russia, Ukraine and Mexico.Despite the Copaxone patent losses, Teva kept its 2017 guidance for $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion in sales and $4.90 to $5.30 earnings per share excluding certain items, which would be up 10% and flat, respectively. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta (MNTA) are working on a Copaxone copy, though they are facing manufacturing issues.Teva cut its expectations on full-year sales of Copaxone by $1 billion to $1.3 billion and expects that to have a 75-cent to 95-cent impact on EPS minus items. The company is appealing the patent losses, but interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg, on the company's earnings conference call this month, said to expect continued price erosion amid generic competition.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 32, meaning it underperforms more than a third of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Ani Pharmaceuticals leads the group with a better CR of 85, out of a best-possible 99. Visit IBD's Stock Checkup for other leaders. Meanwhile, Teva is still among a slew of generic-drug makers, including Mylan (MYL), facing a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation. In addition, Teva in December agreed to pay $519 million to the U.S. government to settle allegations that it bribed officials in Russia, Mexico and Ukraine. A similar probe is ongoing in Israel.Risks are stacking up at Teva, Argus analysts wrote in a research note. On top of those struggles, Teva must repay more than $21 billion in debt over the next five years, including $5.3 billion due in 2018. Among other things, Teva is paying for its acquisition of Actavis' generics business.Former generics CEO Sigurdur Olafsson stepped down in December. Olafsson was ""well-regarded"" at Actavis, Argus analysts said, and had held positions with the company since 2003. He was expected to be instrumental in the integration of Actavis' generics business, Argus analysts said.In the aftermath of the Actavis generics acquisition and as Copaxone sales are hit by generic competition, Argus says Teva could engage in M&A to grow. But ""it is likely to face antitrust hurdles"" and ""there are few (if any) attractive large targets,"" the analysts wrote.RELATED:Momenta, Pfizer Give Teva Pharma Breathing Room On Generic MS DrugTeva Maintains 2017 Guidance Despite Copaxone Patent Losses; Q4 TopsTeva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock Dives

1050,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS) could reportedly shift a large portion of its employees from the U.K. to other parts of Europe if the nation votes on June 23 to leave the European Union, following similar warnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS).A vote to leave the EU could prompt Morgan Stanley to relocate some 1,000 employees from Britain over the coming years, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Many of those jobs could go to Frankfurt, among the EU's leading financial hubs, according to a Sunday Times story over the weekend.Around 5,000 Morgan Stanley employees work in London, along with others working for the bank elsewhere in the U.K, Bloomberg said, while 3,000 work in Continental Europe.Morgan Stanley shares fell 1.1% in the stock market today, JPMorgan dipped 0.9%, Goldman Sachs lost 0.8%, and Citigroup fell 1.7%.Bank stocks have slid as polls show more people in the U.K. want to leave the EU. Many big banks have made London the center of their operations in Europe. A ""Brexit"" vote, banks say, could limit their access to European markets unless they move staff elsewhere in the region, and some banks have made political donations to pro-EU campaigns as a result.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this month that a vote to leave the EU could result in 4,000 lost jobs within the bank's U.K. operations. A vote for Brexit, he said, would mean ""fewer JPMorgan jobs in the U.K. and more jobs in Europe,"" according to Reuters.Citigroup, which has 9,000 employees in the U.K., also said this month it would likely have to ""rebalance our operations across the EU"" if the U.K. left the bloc.Goldman Sachs, which is building a new European headquarters in London, has also warned that the U.K.'s departure could force it to step up efforts elsewhere in the region at the expense of the U.K.

JPMorgan ended up just 0.1%, after rising 2.5% in the morning, and Goldman Sachs advanced 1.45%. Morgan Stanley (MS) added 2.3%, Bank of America (BAC) gained 1% and Citigroup (C) rose 0.75%.After the close, another poll showed a lead for Remain. An ORB/Daily Telegraph survey showed Remain leading 53% vs. 46% for Leave. ORB's poll from a week ago showed Leave with a 49%-48% edged.Among the U.S.-listed shares of the major European banks, which are far more exposed to any fallout from a so-called ""Brexit"" from the EU, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) jumped 7.1%, Barclays (BCS) also rallied 6.8%, HSBC (HSBC) added 2.7%, and Deutsche Bank (DB) gained 4.35%.The polls over the weekend found that people who planned to vote to remain in the EU were neck and neck with those who intended to vote to leave it. The referendum over whether to stay, which Prime Minster David Cameron vowed would take place if he held onto power during elections last year, is set for Thursday.The rebound for the ""Remain"" camp comes after Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament who supported the U.K.'s staying in the EU, was killed Thursday after allegedly being attacked by a man shouting ""Britain first!""The euro and the pound, perhaps perversely, rallied after Cox's death, with traders anticipating that her death could dampen anti-EU sentiment and the harder-line stance against immigration and business regulations that has often accompanied it. Supporters of both leaving and remaining in the EU had halted campaigning following Cox's death but resumed on Sunday.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimated in a report last week that Brexit would take a bite out of U.S. banks' EPS next year, with Morgan Stanley losing as much as 9% from its current estimates. Bernstein warned a Brexit could roil the pound, tank housing prices, push up unemployment and hit U.K. banks harder.Some U.S. banks have provided details on how Brexit would affect them in their annual stress-test submissions, sources told the Financial Times. The results of the first of those annual stress tests, conducted in part by the Federal Reserve, are also set to be released on June 23.

1052,MS,"Ride-hailing app Uber is funneling cash into China to win a market-share war against rival Didi Chuxing Technology -- recently backed by Apple (AAPL) -- but in the U.S., a third of Americans have never heard of Uber nor counterparts like Lyft, a recent survey found.Only 15% of Americans polled in November and December have used ride-hailing apps, the Pew Research Center noted in May. More than half (51%) are familiar with these services but haven't tapped them, and 33% haven't heard of them.That could stem from Uber's recent focus on China, where it's currently in 60 cities vs. the 400 that rival Didi dominates. Didi just added $7 billion to its war chest with a $4.5 billion fundraising round and a $2.5 billion debt package. Its backers include Apple, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY).Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told the Financial Times on Thursday that the company is profitable in hundreds of cities, but is turning that cash back on China. There, it's in second place to Didi, which has an estimated valuation of $25 billion. Uber's is estimated at near $68 billion.""We have hundreds of cities that are profitable globally,"" he said. ""That allows us to invest in new places, and to substantially invest in a very expensive place like China.""Homegrown Uber recently pulled in $3.5 billion in funding from Saudi Arabia and, earlier this week, sources said the company had hired Barclays (BCS), Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to broker a deal for $1 billion to $2 billion in leveraged loans to institutional investors.But Uber is still at least a year out from an initial public offering, the Wall Street Journal said, citing Kalanick.

1054,MS,"Apple (AAPL)-backed unicorn Didi Chuxing Technology raked in $4.5 billion in a fundraising effort to counter an assault by ride-hailing app Uber on the Chinese market, according to anonymous sources cited Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.Meanwhile, other sources say Uber has turned to $2 billion in leveraged loans to feed its voracious need for cash amid a donnybrook pitting Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Toyota Motor (TM) as competitors in the ride-hailing race.The move into the leveraged-loan market follows a $5 billion round earlier this month, including a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia's investment arm, that brings Uber's total value close to $68 billion.To put that in perspective, No. 1 online travel site Priceline (PCLN) is valued at $65 billion. Ford Motor (F), Honda Motor (HMC) and General Motors (GM) are valued between $52 billion and $45 billion. Toyota is valued near $156 billion.Uber is hoping to sell $1 billion to $2 billion in leveraged loans to institutional investors and has hired Barclays (BCS), Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to broker the deal, the sources said. The money could fund its ongoing battle in China against Didi.On Wednesday, Didi reportedly added $7 billion to its fundraising arsenal -- a $4.5 billion round that includes $1 billion from Apple and a $2.5 billion debt package from China Merchants Bank, sources told the WSJ. Now, Didi has $10 billion in cash to fight Uber.The new funding brings Didi's estimated value to more than $25 billion, meaning the Chinese firm could potentially top fellow newcomer Airbnb, which Fortune estimates at a $25.5 billion valuation, to be the No. 3 most valued privately held company, behind Uber and China smartphone maker Xiaomi (at $46 billion).Didi, which is also backed by Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA), is targeting an initial public offering next year in New York, according to Bloomberg. The timing of that IPO depends on its tug-of-war with Uber. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has indicated the company won't go public for at least another year.Editor's note: Corrections made in fourth graph on valuations of automakers.

1057,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) and their venture capital units invested more in fintech companies over the past year than their rivals did, but growing concerns about the industry could taper investments this year and boost the odds of consolidation, a new report from CB Insights and KPMG found.Goldman or its corporate venture segments logged nine such deals for fintechs from the first quarter last year to the first quarter of this year, while Citi or its related units had seven, according to the report. Along those lines, two deals were accredited to JPMorgan (JPM) or its venture units, and one each for Wells Fargo (WFC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Capital One (COF).Matthew Wong, an analyst with CB Insights, said the types of investments have run across the fintech spectrum, and banks show growing willingness to collaborate with an industry that could move much of our finances to our mobile devices and overhaul the way bank branches are used.""In some cases, you're seeing banks like Goldman Sachs or others do deals in a lot of these different new areas that are emerging to have a (strategy) -- not just investment -- but being able to monitor how these spaces are evolving,"" Wong said.The investments over the past five quarters included a round of financing in Financeit, a real-time consumer financing firm, that was led by a Goldman affiliate and closed in October. Another division of Goldman led a $40 million round of funding, announced last April, for Hong Kong's CompareAsiaGroup, a site that allows consumers to compare different financial services.Citigroup's venture arm helped lead a $30 million investment, announced in September, in Chain, a company that uses blockchain -- a technology that uses shared ledger databases to cut down on middlemen -- to facilitate transactions.The report comes amid a murkier outlook for the fintech industry. On one hand, investments in fintech companies overall in the first quarter nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.7 billion globally over 468 deals, marking a recovery from the $3.1 billion raised in the fourth quarter, the report said. A recent bond offering from online lender SoFi got a triple-A rating from Moody's.And the report also talked about a massive new front opening up in insurance-related fintech, which Wong said raised more than $2.6 billion last year.""Why consumers have come to dislike insurance is there's a lot of lack of transparency,"" Wong said.He also said that far more tech entrepreneurs have tried to make getting insurance easier through online comparison platforms, brokerages and other avenues than in the past, with the Affordable Care Act even inspiring innovation despite the industry's high barriers.""The regulatory environment, as difficult as it is in other financial services, is extremely difficult to navigate for a lot of startups who are coming in, guns blazing, trying to disrupt the industry,"" Wong said.But the report also said that funding for venture-capital-backed fintech was on pace for a 10% drop in North America this year, and that U.S. investors had lost some interest in payments companies.""In North America especially, there were fewer startups in the payments space during Q1 ’16, likely due to market saturation and the success of market leaders Square (SQ) and Stripe,"" it said.And online peer-to-peer lenders, like OnDeck (ONDK), have faced concerns about insufficient loan volumes. Prosper, another online lender, said in February it would lay off around 28% of its staff.Calls for greater regulation of such online lenders have also grown amid questions about the conduct of some in the sector. The Justice Department said it would investigate online lending platform Lending Club (LC) after its chief executive resigned following a review that found that the company allegedly misled an investor on a loan sale.Shares of Lending Club have thrashed around in recent weeks, crashing after the investigations were announced and rebounding slightly after a group of Singapore-based companies said they had accumulated an 11.7% stake. On Wednesday, shares edged up 0.45%, OnDeck added 0.4%, while Square fell 1.4%. Goldman Sachs rallied 2.3%, and Citi rose 2.35%.Given those challenges, the CB Insights/KPMG report said that ""some consolidation ... is likely over the next 12 months"" in the North American fintech industry overall.And it questioned whether those difficulties could dampen investors' interest in the sector. ""It remains to be seen how the recent announcements by Lending Club and Prosper will impact that appetite and whether the balance of power switches back to more traditional financial institutions,"" Conor Moore, a senior official for KPMG's venture capital group, said in the report.

1058,MS,"Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led a bank stock rally Wednesday as the Federal Reserve signaled that a June rate hike was more likely than markets had been predicting.Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve April policy meeting showed that many policymakers backed a June rate hike if data showed an improving economy. Some members said they wanted a hike at the April gathering.The major averages lost most of their Wednesday gains on that 2 p.m. release, but bank stocks largely held onto their gains. A rate hike could boost banks' results by allowing them to charge higher rates on loans, widening their net interest margins.Bank of America stock closed up 4.85% in the stock market today.

JPMorgan also benefited from late Tuesday news that it was raising its dividend.Bank stocks had already rallied after San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan signaled Tuesday that a rate hike was possible.Williams told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that data are lining up ""to make a good case for rate increases in the next few meetings.""Kaplan said he’s calling for a rate hike “in the not-too-distant future,” adding that he may push for the move at the June meeting, the Journal reported.And Lockhart told Politico in a roundtable discussion that ""I think it certainly could be a meeting in which action could be taken.""

1060,MS,"Looking for income? The yield on 10-year Treasury notes is paltry 1.75%. One-year certificates of deposit pay an anemic 1.11% on average, according to Bankrate.com.Closed-end funds (CEFs) can be one solution, with yields averaging 6.73%.Their yields range from 6.32% on average for bond CEFs to 7.22% for the average stock CEF, according to Lipper Inc.Energy MLP CEFs had 12-month yield as of April 30 averaging 12.97%, the highest of any Lipper category. The lowest average 12-month yield was 1.05% for developed market CEFs.But CEFs can entail risk. And the ways they work strike many investors as puzzling. So before you pile into one, be sure you understand their pros and cons.Start by refreshing your memory about what a CEF is -- and how it differs from a regular mutual fund, which is an open-end fund. At any given time, a CEF has a fixed number of shares, like a stock or an ETF. Except for the initial public offering, you buy existing shares from other investors, typically through a broker. And the shares trade on an exchange.With a regular mutual fund shares, you buy from the fund itself. And the number of outstanding shares can fluctuate daily.Open-end fund share values reflect the cumulative value of underlying stocks, bonds and other assets, divided by the number of outstanding shares.CEF share values are based on their underlying assets as well as on investor demand, so CEF shares commonly trade at a premium or discount to their NAV. That's a key trait. It makes them more volatile than open-end fund shares. If a CEF's discount is temporary, that's when it is better to buy shares. ""BlackRock believes that it may be advantageous to purchase a (CEF) when it is trading at a discount to its NAV, as each dollar invested purchases more than a dollar of net assets,"" the giant asset manager said in a promotional report.Certain CEFs routinely trade at a discount to NAV except for periods of exceptional demand. The persistent discount to NAV is what separates CEFs and exchange traded funds. An arbitrage arrangement that applies to ETFs helps keep their price in line with their NAV.Investor distaste for that discount is one of the seeds that helped give birth to ETFs.Because of CEFs' persistent discounts to NAV value-conscious investors tend to want to buy them when they're trading at a bigger-than-average discount.The challenge, of course, is to recognize when a discount is just temporary.One helpful tool: The Web page for each CEF at Morningstar.com puts discounts and premiums into context by showing the current, six-month and three-year discount as a percent of NAV.Morningstar pages also show monthly highs and lows for each fund year by year.In addition, the Web site of the Closed-End Fund Association (cefa.com) shows the daily average premiums or discounts for all CEFs as a group and for stock CEFs as a group and bond CEFs as a group.A second key feature is debt. Many CEFs borrow money to buy securities. That can boost yield by adding to the number of holdings in a CEF that are paying dividends, interest or capital-gain income. But it can also magnify losses.If interest rates rise, longer-term bonds and additional rate-sensitive securities will likely lose value. The relative cost of a CEF's debt would rise. It's like having fixed mortgage payments on a house that loses value. Your mortgage payments don't decline, but your collateral is worth less.""The average CEF has almost 33% in leverage,"" said Brock Moseley, founding partner of Miracle Mile Advisors, in Los Angeles. A CEF might even need to sell assets to help make its debt payments. ""When rates rise, that hurts.""Suppose a CEF has 33% leverage. For every $1 you pay per share, you get $1.33 of exposure. That's nice as share price rises. ""But when share price declines, it amplifies your loss,"" said Patrick Galley, chief investment officer and a portfolio manager for RiverNorth investment management firm.A third feature that can be tricky is the makeup of a CEF's income. Some of the income of some CEFs consists of return of principal. It is not from earnings.A CEF may return principal if, for example, it is unable to meet periodic distribution levels that shareholders have come to expect. Depleting capital can erode the CEF's share price over time.Morningstar pages include a distributions tab, where annual payouts are broken down, showing how much of each was income (interest and/or dividends), long-term gain, short-term gain and return of capital.Cefa.com has similar details, plus ex-dividend dates and frequency of payouts.A fourth characteristic that can make CEFs more palatable to some investors: many exchange traded funds specialize in holding CEFs.Investing in CEFs via ETFs can save you the trouble of trying to pick the most suitable CEFs in any given niche, whether it is high yield, U.S. stocks, utilities or another. It's a way of renting a professional manager's expertise, substituting it for your own judgment and time.It also boosts your diversification.For example, among high-yield CEFs, which average 7.87% in yield, YieldShares High Income ETF (YYY) has a 12-month yield of 10.26%. Its total return this year going into Tuesday was 8.16%, putting it in the top 1% of its Morningstar category.Top holdings include the Gamco Gold Natural Resources & Income CEF (GGN), up 43% so far this year. It also holds MS Emerging Markets Domestic CEF (EDD), which is up 14% this year. A third holding is DoubleLine Income Solutions CEF (DSL), which is up 16% this year.

1061,MS,"Big biotech Biogen (BIIB) said Tuesday that it will spin off its hemophilia business into an independent company in a move much anticipated by Wall Street.Biogen, which focuses mainly on neurological diseases, got into hemophilia with the 2014 launch of its two long-acting infusion treatments, Eloctate and Alprolix, for hemophilia A and B, respectively. It carved out some market share from leader Baxter International (BAX), but in mid-April press reports relayed rumors that Biogen was thinking of selling or spinning off the business.Baxter had already made a similar move when it spun off its hemophilia-focused biopharma arm as Baxalta (BXLT) last July. Baxalta was quickly snapped up by Shire (SHPG) in a $32 billion deal.Both Baxalta's and Biogen's infusion therapies are under potential threat from new gene therapies that might be able to cure the disease with a one-time treatment, or at least manage it with far fewer treatments. BioMarin Pharmaceutical's (BMRN) early-stage trial results for its hemophilia gene therapy, reported last month, supported the method's potential.Biogen's press release mentioned that investment in research was one rationale for the spinoff.""The new company, to be named at a later date, will focus on the discovery and development of therapies for the treatment of hemophilia,"" said the release. ""The new company plans to bring longer-acting therapies utilizing the XTEN technology into clinical development in the first half of 2017 and to accelerate the development of bispecific antibodies and hemophilia-related gene therapy programs.""It added that the spinoff will also enable the remaining portion of Biogen to focus on its core multiple-sclerosis business, which has been struggling lately as shown in Biogen's Q1 earnings last month.Still, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee found the decision a bit puzzling.""Why would Biogen want to remove a growing and profitable, long-IP-duration biologics business that diversifies Biogen and 'dilutes' the EPS when it's removed?"" he asked in a research note. ""In addition, Biogen is not selling the business and bringing in cash (approximate $4 billion to $6 billion valuation), and prior to today, the question was what would they do with that cash and who would they buy (they aren't getting cash in this deal). So this seems odd and perhaps implies the valuation is not what the Street perceives if a buyer was not willing to pay up.""Biogen stock was up a fraction in early trading on the stock market today, near 275. The stock has found support above its 50-day line.

1062,MS,"Sumner Redstone won his fight to be rid of a former girlfriend, as a Los Angeles probate judge threw out her lawsuit alleging the 92-year-old media billionaire was mentally incompetent.The ruling ends the case on the second day of a trial but may not avoid a further public airing of the infighting among the Redstone family, some of his former girlfriends, and the nurses who take care of the former Viacom (VIAB) and CBS (CBS) chairman. Within minutes of Monday’s ruling, Redstone’s former lover sued Redstone’s daughter Shari, her two sons and members of his household staff over claims they interfered with her expected inheritance.The trial opened Friday with Redstone’s videotaped testimony in which he used expletives to describe his ex-girlfriend, Manuela Herzer, and said he wanted her out of his life. While the recording confirmed Redstone was in frail health and required help speaking, his wish for Herzer to have no role in his health care decisions was clear.“Redstone’s testimony has ultimately defeated her case,” Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan said Monday in his ruling. “Though Herzer may have believed that Redstone would not be able to say anything, or be able to understand the questions, he did both.”Cowan said there were no legal grounds for him “not to follow his stated wishes.”Herzer made her next step in the fight clear with her new lawsuit in Los Angeles state court. Sumner Redstone cut Herzer out of his will last year when he also removed her as his health care agent, the person to make decisions for him when he is no longer able. Herzer seeks at least $70 million in her lawsuit.The abrupt end of the trial lessens the chance that trustees of Redstone’s estate will step in for the time being. He owns majority voting rights through National Amusements Inc. and, were he declared incompetent by the judge, that could have set in motion a chain of events that would shift control of that company to seven trustees, among them Shari Redstone and Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman.“Ms. Herzer bet wrong when she assumed that Mr. Redstone’s difficulty communicating would result in her reinstatement in his life and fortune,” Robert N. Klieger, one of Redstone’s lawyers, said in a statement.Redstone will seek to recover money that he lavished on Herzer and another ex-girlfriend, Klieger said. “Mr. Redstone is looking forward to liberating the $150 million in ‘gifts’ to Ms. Herzer and her friend,” he said.Pierce O’Donnell, Herzer’s lawyer, said he will appeal Monday’s decision.Herzer filed a petition in November to have Redstone declared incompetent and have her reinstated as his health care proxy. Redstone’s lawyers accused her of being more concerned about being removed from his will, which would have left her $50 million and his Los Angeles mansion in the Beverly Park neighborhood valued at $20 million.Herzer, who describes herself as Redstone’s longtime friend, companion and caretaker, had lived with him since April 2013, together with then-girlfriend Sydney Holland. Herzer dated Redstone from 1999 to 2001, according to her petition. Redstone’s mental health declined rapidly after he broke off with Holland in August, according to Herzer.Trial witnesses would have included Dauman, who was named Redstone’s health care agent in October, and Shari Redstone, with whom the media mogul has had a rocky relationship. This year, she replaced Dauman as her father’s health care agent.Herzer claimed Redstone was being manipulated by the people around him when he kicked her out and that he had become a prisoner in his own home. She said Redstone had become a “living ghost.”Shari Redstone countered that her father’s health has improved since Herzer was out of his life. Keryn Redstone, the daughter of Redstone’s estranged son Brent, joined in the case to support Herzer, arguing that the “tempestuous and difficult” relationship between her grandfather and her aunt necessitated that he be put under court protection.“I am grateful to the court for putting an end to this long ordeal‎,” Shari Redstone said in a statement. “I am so happy for my father that he can now live his life in peace, surrounded by his friends and family.""

1063,MS,"Some Wall Street firms would have to further curtail their reliance on volatile short-term funding under a plan by U.S. regulators that seeks to ensure every big bank can endure months of financial stress.Lenders would be required to depend on stable funding from sources such as deposits, according to a proposal written by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve. Most megabanks already comply with the plan, which aims to guarantee each has sufficient funding to survive for as long as a year.After years of new regulations governing banks’ capital, leverage and liquidity, the net stable funding ratio is among the last of the major constraints spurred by the 2008 financial crisis. The proposal -- the U.S. answer to a 2014 agreement among international regulators -- would add to an earlier demand that lenders maintain a 30-day stockpile of easy-to-sell assets for shorter periods of stress. Both aim to ensure banks don’t have to scramble for funding in a meltdown.The proposal would insist that banks maintain funding “including capital, long-term debt and other stable sources over a one-year window to account for the liquidity risks arising from their assets, derivatives and off-balance-sheet activities,” FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a statement before the vote and released Tuesday.The regulators would push lenders to rely less on repurchase agreements that expire quickly and were an industry mainstay in the years before the financial crisis. Their plan focuses on 15 banks with more than $250 billion in assets or more than $10 billion in foreign exposures on their balance sheets. A related proposal from the Fed will impose less-stringent requirements on 20 firms above $50 billion.Almost all of the covered banks currently meet the proposed requirements set to take effect in 2018, according to regulators’ estimates, and the few that don’t are almost at the mark. The firms would have to report their holdings on a quarterly basis, the regulators said.Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) -- New York-based investment banks that didn’t have as much of a customer-deposit base as the commercial banks -- have amassed deposits at a rapid clip since the 2008 crisis. Goldman Sachs stands to gain even more ground with its new online bank acquired from General Electric (GE) last week.In 2007, a surge in subprime-mortgage defaults led creditors to shorten the duration on funding they offered. As the situation worsened, banks became increasingly reliant on short-term financing that became harder to obtain. To head off similar scenarios, the new proposal calls on lenders to maintain more longer-term funding such as customer deposits. Harder-to-sell assets will need to be backed by higher levels of funding.The Fed is set to vote May 3 on the U.S. plan, which is tougher than the Basel version, most notably in terms of what assets count as the most liquid. The central bank has already targeted stiffer rules at the firms most reliant on short-term funding in the form of a capital surcharge established last year.The Fed also stood alone earlier this month in declaring municipal bonds liquid enough to be in the basket of assets a bank can use to build its short-term stockpile. But this longer-term proposal gives munis a more universal treatment, saying they need funding equal to half of their value. That means munis fall right in the middle of the liquidity range.The net stable funding ratio proposal will be opened for public comment through Aug. 5. Only after reviewing the comments will the three agencies be able to implement a final rule.This latest demand comes as financial firms face rising pressure from regulators, including new constraints on bonuses and rejection of “living-will” plans from five banks. As President Barack Obama’s administration winds down, federal agencies have been trying to finish rules, some of which have been delayed for years.The new liquidity plan “enters an already-crowded field of recent rules targeting liquidity risk in banking,” Jeremy Newell, general counsel of the Clearing House Association, said in a statement. The industry group will be looking at whether it’s “truly coherent with, and complementary to, these other existing requirements.”

1064,MS,"Stock indexes notched insignificant price gains Wednesday, as the two major indexes approached old resistance areas.The Nasdaq, small-cap Russell 2000 and Dow Jones industrial average each inched up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher. Volume was up on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, according to preliminary data.The S&P 500 is now in the thicket of old resistance at the 2105/2115 level. For the Nasdaq, potential resistance looms at 5,000, which is about 1% above Wednesday's close.In the S&P 500 on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley (MS) led with a 3.6% pop. Volume was about 45% above average. On Wednesday, there was no news tied to the advance. On Monday, Morgan Stanley reported Q1 results that topped the Street's consensus estimate on earnings and revenue.American Express (AXP) popped 2% higher in the regular session. After the close, the company's earnings topped the Street's estimate by 7%, while revenue was narrowly higher. The stock rose about 3.5% in after-hours trade.In a broader sense, the U.S. economy received some bullish news Wednesday. The broadest gauge for the money supply, Divisia M4 including Treasuries, grew 4.6% in March. Growth has been strong now for nine months in a row. Some economists regard money supply growth as bullish for the economy.The first take on GDP growth in Q1 will be released before the market's April 28 open. In Q4, real GDP growth came in at 1.4% -- anemic but twice the 0.7% rate initially reported.The economic reports due Thursday include the weekly jobless claims, leading indicators and the Philadelphia Fed's economic survey. Union Pacific (UNP) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are among the companies reporting earnings.

1065,MS,"Big-cap biotech Biogen (BIIB) reported a mixed first quarter Thursday morning, and its depressed stock rose in early trading.Biogen posted Q1 earnings of $4.79 a share excluding one-time items, up 25% from the year-earlier quarter and 32 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 7% to $2.73 billion, about $20 million below Wall Street's average estimate. Biogen did not change its full-year guidance of $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion in revenue.The shortfall came mainly in sales of multiple-sclerosis drugs, which is also Biogen's core business. Oral drug Tecfidera grew 15% to $946 million, about $15 million short of consensus, according to Evercore ISI. Interferon products Avonex and Plegridy together sold $670 million, down 11% from Q1 2015 and more than $50 million below consensus.""The shortfall was increased by $40 million in channel inventory reduction, but also included the effect of further rebates to payers in an increasingly competitive category,"" wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a research note. ""The company's reported EPS of $4.79 beat consensus ... as the company trimmed their R&D expenses more than anticipated.""Biogen's competition in MS comes mainly from Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY), and it might soon get more competition from Roche's (RHHBY) ocrelizumab, which is nearing an FDA filing after performing well in clinical trials.Analyst Max Jacobs of Edison Investment Research was more blunt, calling Biogen's Q1 ""an awful quarter"" that will likely bring a guidance reduction down the road.""While operating expense control helped save the quarter from an earnings standpoint, management will likely be under pressure from investors to do something drastic to right the ship,"" he wrote in a research note.Biogen stock was nonetheless up 4% in early trading on the stock market today, near 277. It's still down more than 40% from its lifetime high, hit in March 2015, as the company's MS franchise first started showing weakness last year.

1067,MS,"Immigration: The need to close America’s porous southern border was given greater urgency this week after reports that an ISIS suspect plotted to escort operatives across the border and drug cartels are helping ISIS set up a base near El Paso, Texas.Federal prosecutors say a 21-year-old Somali-American planned to open up routes to the U.S. through Mexico so ISIS terrorists based in Syria could penetrate the U.S. border and attack American cities.The jailed suspect, Guled Ali Omar, awaits trial on charges he conspired with several other Muslims in the Somali community in Minneapolis to join ISIS to fight in jihad against the West.The FBI secretly recorded Omar and his cell mate discussing several times the possibility of attacks in the U.S, as well as murdering an FBI agent. Images from the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, as well as that of Osama bin Laden, were found on Omar’s phone.Most chilling was the account of a plot to help ISIS fighters from Syria infiltrate the U.S. through Mexico, which wouldn’t be hard to do thanks to the lack of border enforcement by the Obama administration.Under Obama's loose immigration policies, which allow removable aliens to remain in the country, many illegal immigrants who commit additional crimes while in the U.S. are being ignored, even though local police have urged ICE to take control of criminals in their jails and kick them out of the country.According to newly obtained government figures, ICE last year opted not to deport but to release 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants, including 208 convicted murderers, more than 900 convicted sex offenders and 12,307 convicted drunk drivers.Overall, those released into virtually every U.S. state carried a total of 64,197 convictions among them, or an average of 3.25 convictions each, according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis. The data also reveal that the released group committed a total of 8,234 violent crimes.It’s not known how many of these released immigrant felons are members of dangerous gangs, such as MS-13, or affiliated with terrorists groups. But many go on to commit additional crimes after they are released into the general U.S. population.And there is new evidence that drug gangs have formed alliances with terrorist groups such as ISIS.According to a Judicial Watch, a Washington-based government watchdog agency, Mexican drug traffickers are helping ISIS terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the U.S. to explore targets for future attacks.""Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir -- an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso,” Judicial Watch said in a new report quoting Homeland Security sources. ""Khabir trained hundreds of al-Qaida fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, and has lived in Mexico for more than a year.”He reportedly now trains thousands of men -- mostly Syrians and Yemenis -- to fight at an ISIS base near Juarez.Staking out U.S. targets is not hard for Khabir, who actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article published earlier this month that the U.S. border is so open that he “could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.”A top Mexican diplomat says in the article she can't understand why the Obama regime is “culpably neglecting this phenomenon,” adding that “this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States.”Neither can we. That wall can’t come soon enough.

1068,MS,"Stocks held on to mild gains in midafternoon action Monday ahead of a huge week for earnings reports.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.5% gain, while the Nasdaq composite lagged with a 0.2% advance. But the Nasdaq is coming off an initial morning drop of as much as 0.5%. Volume is edging higher on the Nasdaq and sharply lower on the NYSE compared with the same time on Friday, which saw a big boost in trading due to expiring weekly and monthly options.In the stock market today, Amazon.com (AMZN) rallied nearly 1% to 631.46 in volume running 11% above its 50-day average. The stock is still within the 5% chase zone from a 603.34 handle entry. Amazon, which has been featured extensively in the past few weeks and in IBD Leaderboard, is going head-to-head with rival Netflix (NFLX) by launching a monthly subscription model of its streaming video content. Up to now, those who paid for a yearlong Amazon Prime membership also received Amazon Video content.Netflix is slated to post Q1 results after the close on Monday. Analysts see profits falling 73% to 3 cents a share, on top of an 8% drop in the year-ago quarter. Netflix continues to invest aggressively in new content and marketing in its quest to be the top global conduit of streaming content.Netflix has forecast 6.1 million new streaming subscribers in Q1 for a global total of 80.86 million. The northern California firm targets 1.75 million new U.S. streaming subscribers and 4.35 million new international subscribers.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley (MS) showed little change after reporting another dud quarter early Monday. Earnings fell 35% to 55 cents a share on a 20% plunge in revenue, the worst top-line performance since the third quarter of 2012. After-tax margin shrank to 13.2% vs. 16.3% a year ago. Morgan has a mediocre C Sales-Margins-Return on Equity Rating.Morgan stock has been struggling ever since it took out the 200-day moving average in big trade on Aug. 20 last year. That decline broke a strong uptrend in the stock that began with a breakout from a long, deep cup-with-handle base at 18.67 in October 2012.Commodity-related stocks continued to shine. U.S. Concrete (USCR), No. 1 in the IBD 50, rose 2% to 65.56, getting even more extended past a 59.50 cup-with-handle entry. It receives a 99 Composite Rating.

1069,MS,"The stock market opened modestly lower Monday as some positive earnings news helped mitigate some early pressure from falling oil prices.The Nasdaq lost 0.2%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%.The stock market today is poised for its best weekly open in some time. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving averages and feeling at least a mild sense of momentum after strong sessions last week.Small caps are sending mixed signals. The small cap S&P 600 opens the week also back above its 200-day line after a 3% jump last week. The other leading small cap gauge, the Russell 2000, jumped 3.1% last week, but that was just enough to bring it even with its 200-day line, which could offer either resistance or support, depending on the index's performance this week.Little economic news is expected on Monday, with the National Association of Home Builders scheduled to roll out its April builders confidence survey at 10 a.m. ET.  The Federal Reserve calendar showed President William Dudley scheduled to open the New York Federal Reserve Bank conference at 8:30 a.m. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speaks at 12:30 p.m.The dollar slipped in early trading action.

The Rhode Island-based outfit reported a broad Q1 sales and earnings beat, helped by sales of Disney Princess and Frozen dolls. The stock ended Friday in buy range, almost 4% above a 79.50 buy point in a cup with handle base.Morgan Stanley (MS) was mostly unchanged after its Q1 report. The bank's earnings and revenue slipped less than expected, although return on equity dropped to 6.2%, less than half its year-ago level.Trade among leading stocks was mixed and moderate. Gains and losses on the IBD 50 list held to less than 1%. Real estate investment trust CoreSite Realty (COR) was one of the top performers, up 0.9%. It's just below a 71.44 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.Overseas, international markets traded generally lower under the influence of weakened oil prices.

1070,MS,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10..... Watch for Brinker (EAT), Comerica (CMA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Harley Davidson (HDI), Kansas City Southern (KSU),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Take Good Care

1072,MS,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

1073,MS,"Comcast’s (CMCSA) investment in Groupon -- through a company headed by its former CFO -- continues the cable TV firm’s move into Internet, software and media assets.Comcast continues to steer away from major M&A, though, following last year’s demise of the proposed Time Warner Cable (TWC) acquisition.Atairos, an investment firm formed by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis and funded mainly by the cable TV firm, said on Monday that it would invest $250 million in struggling Groupon (GRPN). Angelakis will join Groupon’s board.Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group (BABA) earlier this year invested in Groupon.While Comcast’s chief financial officer, Angelakis engineered the cable TV firm’s two-part purchase of media giant NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE).In November, Comcast brought in new M&A expertise. Comcast named Robert Eatroff, formerly Morgan Stanley’s (MS) head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, as its new executive VP of global corporate development and strategy.Comcast has signaled interest in making acquisitions overseas. Speculation that Comcast could buy a wireless phone company, such as T-Mobile US (TMUS), has cooled, though the cable TV firm has filed as a potential bidder in a government auction of airwaves.Comcast continues to active in media investments. Comcast’s Fandango, an online movie ticket seller, earlier this year acquired movie websites Flixster and Rotten Tomatoes from Time Warner’s Warner Bros. Fandango also bought online video retailer M-Go.In 2015, NBCUniversal invested $250 million in website BuzzFeed. Comcast also invested in digital publisher Vox Media and Visible World.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1074,MS,"At some prominent financial advisory firms, nearly 20% of the advisors have some misconduct in their past. That fact is among the findings in a study of 1.2 million U.S. advisor disclosure statements by researchers from the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Overall, “roughly 7% of advisors have misconduct records,” says the study, “The Market for Financial Adviser Misconduct,” published at the online Social Science Research Network. The study uses information from BrokerCheck, a database of advisors and firms from the federal Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).The most common forms of misconduct are unsuitable investments (committed by 21.29% of those who misbehave); misrepresentation or misleading reports, often dealing with account activity (17.7%); and unauthorized activity (15.1%).Some firms tend to avoid misconduct. At Morgan Stanley (MS), only one in every 126 advisors, or 0.79%, has misconduct on his or her record. Other clean firms include Goldman Sachs (GS) (0.88%) and BNP Paribas Securities (1.17%).Other companies are not quite so strict. Nearly one-fifth (19.6%) of the advisors at Oppenheimer & Co. have one or more incidents of misconduct in their past. Other companies with a high proportion of rule breakers include First Allied Securities (17.7%) and Wells Fargo (WFC) Advisors Financial Network (15.3%).Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network should not be confused with other Wells Fargo organizations; Wells Fargo Securities, for instance, has a low misconduct rate of 1.7%. And Oppenheimer & Co. is not the same organization as Oppenheimer Asset Management, Oppenheimer Capital and similarly named groups.Financial firms are often vigilant in punishing advisors. “Half of financial advisors lose their job after misconduct,” the report on advisors says. “Following misconduct, advisors face longer unemployment spells and move to less reputable firms, with a 10% reduction in compensation.”

1075,MS,"Credit Suisse (CS) raised its total number of planned job cuts to 6,000, as the Switzerland-based bank expects its Q1 trading revenue to receive a pummeling of up to 45%.The move is designed to boost Credit Suisse's performance, as its U.S. stock has tumbled 30% so far this year and is trading near lows not seen in more than a decade. Of the 6,000 planned jobs cuts, 2,800 already have taken place. The cuts will reduce the cost base for the bank's global markets unit by 18.2% to $5.4 billion by the end of 2018, Credit Suisse said.Investors apparently welcomed the news, as the bank's U.S.-listed shares closed down 0.2% on the stock market today.The bank's global markets unit has been hurt by ""the combination of a high and inflexible cost base, exposure to illiquid inventory in fixed income, historically low levels of client activity and challenging market conditions has led to disappointing financial results,"" said Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam in a statement.Thiam took over the Zurich-based lender last July and has attempted to turn things around. Last month, Credit Suisse announced 4,000 job cuts. Thiam also has asked for his planned bonus to be reduced.Credit Suisse said Wednesday it plans to reduce costs by at least $4.4 billion by 2018. It also aims to eliminate several of its businesses, including European securitized product trading and distressed debt.Q1 trading revenue has been abysmal at other banks, too. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it expects its trading revenue to fall 20%, while Citigroup (C) warned its trading revenue may plunge by 25%.Meanwhile, banks are in the midst of downsizing, if not outright breaking up. Late last year, Morgan Stanley (MS) said it planned to cut 1,200 jobs. Deutsche Bank (DB) last year said it planned to cut roughly 23,000 positions, or roughly 25% of its workforce.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1076,MS,"Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Marissa Mayer has a bit of extra incentive to sell the ailing Internet company, which is facing a proxy fight.According to CNN Money, Mayer gets $37 million if she's fired after selling the Sunnyvale-based company, under the terms of her employment contract.But she’ll be paid only $12.5 million if she’s let go without a sale. In that case, Mayer would take home $1 million in salary, a $2 million cash bonus and $9.5 million in stock that would vest in 2016, the report says.But being ousted after a sale significantly ups the ante by triggering ""the release of all her stock awards. In virtually any other scenario, Mayer would have needed to stay at Yahoo for a certain period of time in order to cash out those rewards,"" said CNN Money.In either scenario, her golden parachute will be worth significantly less now than it was a year ago, since the price of Yahoo stock has fallen 18% over the past 12 months. On Wednesday, Yahoo stock rose a fraction, to 36.56.A year ago, Mayer would have taken home $110 million had she lost her job because of Yahoo's sale and $26 million if she was let go without a sale, the report said. Mayer, who joined Yahoo in 2012, earned $42 million in cash and stocks in 2014, CNN Money said. Her 2015 compensation is expected to be reported next month.Sale or not, Yahoo is facing rough waters. Last week, in a letter charging the current board of Yahoo with failing to deliver results for its shareholders, activist investor Starboard Value announced that it wants to sweep out all of the ailing Web company's nine directors and replace them with its own slate during Yahoo's 2016 shareholder meeting.The letter -- from Starboard Value managing member Jeffrey Smith, one of Starboard's slate of Yahoo board nominees -- indicates that Starboard also doesn't trust Yahoo's current directors to perform in terms of either the strategic review of Yahoo's core search and display-ad business or with the eventual fate of Yahoo's 15% stake in China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) and its holdings in Yahoo Japan.Yahoo this month appointed two members to its board, Catherine Friedman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), and Eric Brandt, a former chief financial officer of Broadcom (AVGO).Yahoo's revenue growth has stalled for nearly a decade as ad dollars continue to slip away to rivals including Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, and others that include high-profile startups Snapchat and Pinterest.Yahoo has reportedly gotten interest from as many as 40 groups who have until April 11 to submit preliminary bids for its core business and Asian operations.

1077,MS,"The process of finding a buyer for struggling Web portal Yahoo (YHOO) is reportedly in the middle of its first round, and interest is high, according to a CNBC report, which cited sources close to the matter.This comes after a separate report said Microsoft (MSFT) might put up ""significant"" financing in a bid for Yahoo. Microsoft executives are in talks with potential investors about providing funds to buy the troubled Internet company, Re/Code reported.A Reuters report said those talks are in the early stages. Microsoft and Yahoo have a longstanding search and ad partnership, and Microsoft is focused on preserving that relationship, it said.Private equity firms interested in Yahoo have approached Microsoft, Reuters said.Microsoft declined to comment.Microsoft has been meeting with private-equity firms and saying it might lend ""significant"" financing in a bid for Yahoo, according to Re/Code.In 2008, then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer tried to buy Yahoo for about $45 billion.Yahoo’s overall market cap is now $33 billion, but that includes its its major stakes in China e-com leader Alibaba Group (BABA) and in Yahoo Japan. Minus those holdings, analysts have pegged the price of Yahoo's core business at $6 billion to $8 billion.Excluding its 15% stake in Alibaba, Rosenblatt analyst Martin Pyykkonen said in an industry note last week: ""Yahoo's current market cap implies $3.3 billion valuation for the core business and the Yahoo Japan stake. We think the fundamental outlook for Yahoo as a 'growth' stock is continuing to erode, especially in light of strong secular trends which are benefiting the likes of Facebook (FB) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), both of which have more revenue concentration from mobile advertising.""Re/Code said that Yahoo started engaging with ""strategic"" bidders that include AT&T (ATT), Verizon (VZ)and Comcast (CMCSA), with private equity and other investment firms to come next, the report's sources said. Interested parties reportedly include Advent International, Vista Equity Partners, TPG and KKR (KKR). Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in December that the U.S. wireless carrier could look at buying Yahoos's core business if it were a good fit.Activist investor Starboard Value announced Thursday that it wants to sweep out all of the ailing Web company's nine directors and replace them with its own slate during Yahoo's 2016 shareholder meeting.This month, Yahoo appointed two members to its board: Catherine Friedman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), and Eric Brandt, a former chief financial officer at Broadcom (AVGO).""This is gearing up to be an epic proxy fight, and we believe that this will create a significant overhang on Yahoo shares,"" said Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi in an industry note on Thursday. ""It's unusual to see an investor try to replace an entire board, but this clearly highlights to us that Starboard does not trust any of the existing board members will do what needs to be done to create value for Yahoo shareholders.""Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has struggled to turn the company around in her nearly four years as Yahoo's leader.Yahoo stock was up 1%, near 35, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.

1078,MS,"So with little else to go on…the mkt churned – moved back and forth in a very tight range to end the day slightly higher as it digested Friday's move in the face of what is sure to be a busy 'Central Bank' week........expect lots of information, monetary policy decisions and speculation on behalf of traders around the world.Oil came under new pressure as oil investors/traders focused on the noise coming out of Tehran…..You see - Iranian officials reminded the world that they would NOT be joining the other members of the oil producing nations in capping production – or at least not until they grow their exports to 4 million barrels/day. So the March OPEC meeting is now seen as a non-event as investors look towards the April meeting for any action. As a result – Oil backed off and energy names/oil service stocks were weak.Next up - Gold! Gold has been seeing some profit taking – after its 22% surge since late December......Over the past couple of days - we have seen the trader types take about 4% out of the commodity as they 'ring cash register' and put the cash on the sidelines ahead of what could be a volatile week.Now while the mkt did not 'fall out of bed' – the choppy trading does remind us that there are 4 central bank policy meetings/decisions/conversations happening this week. With the FED's monetary policy decision only hours away now….investors/traders/asset managers must also consider the impact of policy decisions coming out of the BoE (Bank of England), SNB ( Swiss National Bank) and the BoJ (Bank of Japan) this week. (This morning we found out that the BoJ as expected left rates unchanged AND downgraded their outlook on the Japanese economy - not good). Now while the majority of analysts/strategists/traders do not expect a move in US rates- they will be paying very close attention to the statement. Will we continue to see this 'central bank divergence'* or will the FED come to its senses at his time of continued global economic weakness?[*Central bank divergence - think US raising rates while the other major central banks are moving to negative rates.]As Bob Doll - Sr Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management points out:""They're going to be careful in how they say they're not done raising interest rates""So expect the rumors and speculation to heat up.....did she say 'definitely in June'? Did she tease and suggest that April or May are a possibility? Could she raise more than 1/4 of point - yes.....but did she intimate that she would? Is the recent run up in oil enough to change the course of the conversation? Is oil really expected to keep going up in light of all the supply that still exists?Now yesterday - we talked about how producers will come back on line as the price of oil moves higher....in fact - the WSJ ran with the article detailing the facts....and this morning - like clockwork they feature a headline article suggesting that:""Many Shale Producers are Unable to Ramp Up Oil Output""......And why?Well first - many of them are broke (I think they used the words 'financially strapped'), they have sent thousands of workers to the unemployment line (estimates suggest 110k+) and they have idled so much equipment (estimates say 60%+) that they can't very easily bring it back on line with no one to man the equipment.....and even IF prices should rally back to $50/barrel or greater - many of these companies are vowing to 'take it slow'......so there is your contra argument for the supply/demand argument.....after getting burned badly - do not expect the producers to run hog wild even if prices appear to be firming.....that being said - I do not see any reason for prices to move much higher than the low $40's at best.....although they will use the 'spring/summer driving season' as a reason for prices to move higher! I guess it just depends on who is screaming the loudest....Will it be Goldman Sachs (GS)? JP Morgan (JPM)? Citigroup (C)? Royal Bank of Canada (RY)? Morgan Stanley (MS)?......Now I have mentioned a number of times that the mkt has gone right to major resistance over the past month – helped by the move in Oil, the improving sense that maybe the US can weather the latest storm, the prospect of more stimulus coming from a range of central banks – think ECB, BoJ and PBoC – along with the renewed assumptions that the FED will hold steady……. All of this has helped to restore some sense of calm and confidence in the mkts.(Confidence about central bank policy - I remind you - can be short lived and we are about to find out just how US and global investors really feel about Janet's plan moving forward.)Many will look to tie yesterday's lack of action to the weakness in oil – I am not one of those…..now maybe you can tie the weakness in oil and the energy sector to the Iranians – but it is difficult to tie those statements to much else…I mean think about it.....do consumer staples, healthcare, housing, or financials really care about what the Iranians say or do when it comes to oil? Not so much.....I mean it's the Iranians - not the Saudi's......Let's not get carried away......Yes – inflammatory comments conveniently allow for some profit taking by traders in segments of the mkt that have enjoyed a recent run up off of the lows of February but if the mkt has really changed its tune – then we should continue to see the break between oil and the broader mkt as the focus returns to the health of the US & global economy and global monetary policy.Overnight saw global mkts back off on renewed commodity weakness and cautious central bank statements. Longer term investors now sitting back and traders turning a bit cautious after the recent run up in mkts and as the focus returns to global monetary policy....The BoJ as noted has started the conversation and it was NOT bullish.....Japan - 0.68%, Hong Kong - 0.72%, China +0.3% and ASX -1.43%European mkts are also under pressure as they react to the renewed commodity weakness...copper mining company - Antofagasta plunging 10% after reporting full yr pre-tax profits fell by 83% and cancelling their 4th qtr dividend. FTSE -0.69%, CAC 40 - 09.95%, DAX - 0.49%, Eurostoxx - 0.82%, Spain -1.27% and Italy - 0.94%US futures are down 10 pts in early trading - piercing S&P 2000.....Lots going on in the US today...... there are several key economic reports due this morning: Retail Sales, PPI and the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. In addition it is another 'Super Tuesday' in the political arena......Ohio and Florida are the Brass Rings and could well set the stage for what many now expect to be the tickets......Trump vs. Clinton.......Splinter far right and far left organizations continue to try and disrupt the process - but in the end democracy will prevail and Americans will get what they voted for - just as we have all endured 8 yrs of the Obama administration.....maybe it is time for a change..... I'm just sayin.......Let's discuss....But, the “main attraction ” is still the FOMC Rate Decision due out in 35 hrs.....and again it is not the decision (no hike) but rather the message that she delivers that will become the catalyst for the next move..... I continue to believe that our upper range will be confined to the 2020 area while the downside could see us test 1975 if we are not able to hold at S&P 2000. In the end though - no one should be surprised at all - UNLESS she completely backs off of any rate hike at all....(0% chance of that). So the trader types should get ready for the volatility while the long term investors should place their bets and line the book on the way down to scoop up any knee jerk reaction......Take Good Care

Time and again, operating results have been decidedly negative and materially worse than management's guidance and external expectations,"" said an open letter to Yahoo shareholders from Starboard Value managing member Jeffrey Smith, one of Starboard's  Yahoo board nominees. ""In fact, even after management publicly stated that EBITDA had troughed in the third quarter of 2014 and would grow going forward, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) actually fell 47% year-over-year.""Smith's letter indicates that Starboard also doesn't trust Yahoo's current directors to perform in terms of either the strategic review of Yahoo's core search and display ad business or with the eventual fate of Yahoo's 15% stake in China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) and its holdings in Yahoo Japan. ""There are good reasons for shareholders to be highly concerned about the current strategic review process,"" wrote Smith.

1083,MS,"FBI agents aren’t the only ones getting a crack at the former Hillary Clinton aide reportedly ""singing like a bird"" about the unsecured, possibly illegal email server that Clinton paid him to set up in her home.Next month, a federal judge is expected to give lawyers for a government watchdog group a whack at him, too -- and his testimony could be made public just as Clinton enters the general election for president.Washington-based Judicial Watch will get to depose former State Department IT specialist Bryan Pagliano pending approval of its witness list in April, which seems to be just a formality.U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan already has OK’d the group’s motion for discovery in the civil case, which alleges that Clinton and the State Department conspired to thwart Freedom of Information Act and other public requests for her communications as secretary of state by creating an off-grid email system.Judicial Watch seeks some 50,000 pages of missing Clinton emails.""It appears that no one took any steps to ensure that agency records on ‘clintonemail.com' were secured within the State Department's record systems so that FOIA requests received during the former secretary's tenure would be responded to appropriately,” Sullivan said. ""How in the world could this happen?""Pagliano’s testimony is key to finding out.He headed computer operations for Clinton’s 2008 presidential run before she installed him in his sensitive role at State. For more than four years, Pagliano maintained the homebrew server that hosted “clintonemail.com.” Clinton reportedly paid him at least $5,000 for his services, which included several trips to New York, before leaving the department in 2013.Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton confirms that it will grill the longtime Clinton loyalist under oath, along with aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills and other officials who handled email records requests. Pagliano was key to helping ensure that Clinton was able to communicate and conduct official, often classified, government business outside secure channels and records-management systems.Specifically, Judicial Watch lawyers will want to find out the facts and circumstances surrounding Pagliano’s hiring. Other lines of questioning for this star witness include:* When was the parallel email system created? Before Clinton was sworn in as secretary?* What government resources were used? Who else knew about it?* Why didn't Foggy Bottom provide the secretary with an official email address or personal computing devices?* Who besides Abedin used an email address on “clintonemail.com” to conduct official government business? Did anyone from the Clinton Foundation have access?Lawyers also want to know if Pagliano was ever told to keep quiet about the off-grid system, or keep the National Archives in the dark. Or if he or other employers were reprimanded for questioning the use of it to conduct government business. Or if they were told not to fully respond to FOIA requests.They’ll also ask Pagliano if he helped Clinton delete email records, and whether backup records exist for all Clinton’s and Abedin’s personal emails on a personal storage table (.pst), thumb drive, CD or phone. If so, where do such archives reside? Does he possess a copy? Did Platte River Services or Datto -- the tech firms that managed her server after his 2013 departure -- keep copies?Under an immunity deal, Pagliano is cooperating with the FBl in a separate criminal investigation into possible national security breaches.Because there’s no longer reasonable cause for him to think that testifying could result in his prosecution, it will be hard for Pagliano to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when subpoenaed by Sullivan's court, which is hearing the case as a civil, not criminal, matter.If Pagliano is still unwilling to testify, Judicial Watch lawyers say they will depose “third party” witnesses, such as Platte and Datto, as well as Clinton Executive Services, which retained Platte and Datto to provide Internet server and backup services. They’ll also subpoena documents and storage devices.Though Clinton has claimed to have turned over 55,000 pages of records, another 50,000 remain missing -- including at least nine emails between Clinton and President Obama.Clinton also could be deposed, but she dismissed the lawsuit as politically motivated. ""The litigation that others have brought -- and some of them are, you know, right-wing outfits -- those will just proceed,” she said, ""and again, I'm not worried or concerned about them.""Fitton said Clinton’s hubris could trip her. ""Mrs. Clinton thinks she is above the law,” he told me. ""Her dismissal of federal court orders is a prime example of the arrogance that has resulted in an FBI criminal investigation.""Even Sullivan, a Clinton appointee, is scandalized by the secretary’s gall. ""Here you have Mrs. Clinton and Abedin deciding, after neither Mrs. Clinton nor Ms. Abedin were government employees, what e-mails are federal records and what e-mails are not,” he said.""It just boggles the mind that the State Department allowed this circumstance to arise in the first place,” the judge added. ""It's just very, very troubling.""Sperry, formerly IBD Washington bureau chief, is the author of “Infiltration.”

1084,MS,"Shares of big banks all fell in response to the Federal Reserve slashing projections for future interest rate hikes, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) all finished lower Wednesday.In December, the central bank raised a key interest rate to 0.25%-0.5%, the first increase since 2006, and Fed officials such as Chair Janet Yellen talked about four rate hikes this year. On Wednesday, not only did the Fed pass on another rate hike, but implied just two quarter-point hikes to the federal funds rate this year.Markets still only see 1 rate hike in 2016, with the timing pushed back from June to September.The muted expectations are the result of a struggling global economy, a battered energy sector and stock market turmoil to start the year. Though the markets generally cheered the news, banks did not. JPMorgan shares fell 0.5% to 58.92 on the stock market today. Wells Fargo and Citigroup each tumbled 0.9%, Bank of America fell 1.9%,  U.S. Bancorp (USB) 0.6% and Goldman 1%.Bank of America fell back below its 50-day moving average after retaking that line last Friday. But JPMorgan, Wells, Citi and U.S. Bancorp held above that support level. Goldman found resistance just below the  50-day line.The lower-for-longer interest rate environment has cut into banks' net interest margins, a key measure of their profitability. It gauges the difference between what banks earn from interest paid to them from loans versus the interest banks pay out to depositors. The longer interest rates remain low, the more net interest margins get squeezed and the less profitable banks become.Coupled with squeezed margins is the lousy start to the year for banks' trading revenue. JPMorgan forecast a 20% drop in trading revenue in Q1. Citigroup said its trading revenue will drop 25% this quarter.Adding to the bad news are the nonperforming loans to energy companies, hurt badly by the collapse of crude oil prices since June 2014. JPMorgan boosted its Q1 energy loan loss reserves to $1.5 billion while Wells Fargo set aside $1.2 billion for potential losses in its energy loan portfolio. Morgan Stanley says 40% of its hefty energy loan portfolio are junk rated.Layoffs at Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley (MS) have hurt too.

1085,MS,"Apple (AAPL) stock rose Tuesday on a report from Morgan Stanley that iPhone sales this quarter are looking better than expected.Apple was up 2%, near 105, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Katy Huberty reiterated her overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 135.March-quarter iPhone demand is “tracking ahead of expectations,” she said in a report Tuesday. Based on Morgan Stanley analysis of sell-through data, Apple likely will sell 56.5 million iPhone units in the first quarter, she said.“This is clearly ahead of expectations as investors are skeptical Apple can reach implied guidance of 52 million,” Huberty said.China is the country with the strongest iPhone sales growth, based on Morgan Stanley’s tracker, she said.Apple’s next potential catalyst is its spring product-launch event on Monday. Apple is widely expected to unveil a new 4-inch smartphone, a smaller iPad Pro and new Apple Watch bands.Investors are most likely to focus on the rumored iPhone SE on Monday, S&P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino said in a report Tuesday.Apple’s new 4-inch smartphone will replace the iPhone 5S, which was released in September 2013. The new model is expected to sport an A9 chip, NFC technology to enable Apple Pay and a 12-megapixel, rear-facing camera.“We believe the device will be used as an opportunity for Apple to expand into lower cost emerging regions where the company has very low market share,” Zino said. “Given the saturation and slowing growth within the smartphone space and Apple’s already dominant position in the high-end market, we believe expanding its offerings to capitalize in higher growth regions will help support iPhone unit growth over the next 12-18 months. We see the potential of at least an additional 10-15 million in iPhone shipments (around 5% of total unit volume).”Zino has a positive rating on Apple stock with a 12-month price target of 130.On Monday, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock and 12-month price target of 120.

1090,MS,"Intercontinental Exchange is lining up financing for a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as it prepares to go head to head with Deutsche Boerse to win control of the U.K. company.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is working with Morgan Stanley (MS) and Moelis & Co. to explore a takeover of LSE, is in discussions with banks to fund a formal offer in the coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Talks are at an early stage, no final decision has been made on the timing or size of the bid, and ICE could still decide against an offer, they said.Deutsche Boerse and LSE on Feb. 23 announced talks to combine and create a global player worth at least 20 billion pounds ($28 billion), which could better compete with ICE as well as CME Group (CME), the world’s largest derivatives market. A formal proposal from ICE or Deutsche Boerse could spark a bidding war between the suitors, which each have until late March to make an official offer for the bourse under the U.K.’s takeover rules.Deutsche Boerse is likely to announce the details of a merger plan with LSE as early as next week, according to a different person familiar with the matter. ICE, which sees the potential to generate more cost savings with LSE than Deutsche Boerse, is likely to wait until after the Germans bid, one of the people said.CME Group is also working with advisors to assess whether it could challenge the deal, people familiar with the matter said last week.Representatives for ICE and LSE declined to comment. An official for Deutsche Boerse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Citigroup's stock has fallen about 20% so far this year. Its current IBD Composite Rating is 39, meaning it is being outperformed by 61% of other publicly traded companies.The stock market rout to begin the year, coupled with lower-for-longer interest rates, has hurt banks this year. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) last month said its trading revenue has fallen 20% so far in 2016.Other big lenders, such as Deutsche Bank (DB), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and Barclays (BCS), have announced layoffs in recent months.

1092,MS,"Expressions of interest are pouring in from dozens of groups that are eyeing buying struggling Web portal Yahoo (YHOO), with Verizon (VZ) rumored to be the most likely acquirer, said Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak in an industry research report on Monday.""Verizon is still the most likely savior despite potential risks, in our opinion,"" wrote Cakmak, who added that more than 40 expressions of interest have been made for Yahoo and that technology-focused investment banker Frank Quattrone may be positioning embattled Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer along with the company's core business as a package deal.But the prospects for a private industry pair-up are low, according to Cakmak.""While we have entertained the idea of private equity previously, we no longer think it's a realistic option given Ms. Mayer's desire to maintain a central role,"" wrote Cakmak.Monness Crespi estimates the value of Yahoo's core assets at $3 billion to $4 billion.Yahoo has received nearly 40 expressions of interest from prospective bidders including Verizon, AT&T and Time, said a report last week in the NY Post.Mayer is under intensified pressure from major investor Starboard Value, which has urged the exit of Mayer and some directors, as well as the spinoff of Yahoo's core search business. Yahoo directors are close to offering at least two board seats to the activist hedge fund in order to avert a proxy fight, according to the New York Post's report.Aside from forming a committee of independent directors to explore possible transactions, Yahoo announced last week that it will bring in Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and PJT Partners as financial advisors, along with law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.Another company rumored to be interested in Yahoo is Comcast (CMCSA). Verizon has talked up its interest in buying some Yahoo assets ""at the right price,"" but also said it does not want to ""catch a falling knife,"" referring to the state of Yahoo's business.Rumors re-emerged last week that e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) might buy back a valuable stake that Yahoo now holds in the Chinese company.Yahoo's Asian assets — comprised of its Alibaba holdings and a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan — represent the vast majority of Yahoo’s $32.2 billion market value. Yahoo owns a 15% stake in Alibaba, or about 384 million shares. But some observers say such a transaction is unlikely because of high tax implications for Alibaba.Analysts say Yahoo is poised to lose more ad dollars to Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and high-profile startups such as Snapchat and Pinterest.Yahoo stock was up 1% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 34, its highest point since late December. But concerns on the health of its core business has driven down Yahoo stock 22% since this time last year.Alibaba stock was up 2%, near 74. A Wall Street Journal report noted that the China e-commerce king's Ant Financial Services is looking to raise up to $3 billion, pricing the subsidiary's valuation at over $50 billion and potentially vaulting it into the Top 10 of China's largest financial companies.

1094,MS,"Capital keeps fledgling firms and ambitious projects alive. How firms extend financial lifelines:Stay alive. Most startups -- 80% by one estimate -- launch with founder funding. Loans from friends and family are the No. 2 capital source for entrepreneurs.“That only gets you open,” said Michael Sinensky, owner of FB Hospitality -- known in New York City for its popular bars and eateries.Look beyond. Sinensky founded Assure Funding last year to offer an alternative lending option. “We specialize in growth capital for new businesses,” he told IBD.Assure focuses on young but established firms seeking capital for things like expansion, inventory, staffing and unexpected expenses. “They just need some help in that moment,” he said.Show character. The numbers have to add up in any deal. Sinensky also weighs the borrower’s professional experience.“It’s the person and their history,” he said. “We look to see: Is this his first business? Have they taken out loans before?”Shop around. Sinensky’s top advice to entrepreneurs is to be discerning consumers when it comes to loans and lines of credit. “There’s a lot of different rates,” he said.Ride the wave. Small business lending was projected to hit $7.9 billion in 2015, according to Morgan Stanley (MS). That was up 68% from 2014.“I think you are going to see more private lenders,” said Billy Procida, CEO of Procida Funding & Advisors, a commercial real estate lending firm.Gain experience. Procida rose as a builder and developer on the East Coast -- and spent a storied year in 1990 apprenticing with real estate mogul (and now presidential hopeful) Donald Trump -- before getting into investing and lending.Working on big deals gave Procida insights from both sides of the table -- developer and lender.“I pretty much have your deal sized up within five to seven minutes of you getting here,” he said.Check yourself. Entrepreneurs seeking capital need to be brutally realistic. “People underestimate the budget, underestimate the schedule, and they overestimate the value,” Procida said.Bring expertise. A top team sways lenders, so don’t skimp on talent. “Surround yourself with people better than yourself,” Procida said. If you’ve tapped a big-name architect, bring that pro with you to meetings with financiers.Stay close. Procida takes a hands-on approach. His 100 Mile Fund specializes in deals within 100 miles -- or two hours' commute time -- of his office in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.Close proximity benefits both parties. “We’re on the property twice a month,” he said. “We provide development expertise and marketing expertise.”Venture out. Other funding approaches -- angel investing, venture capital and crowdfunding -- remain highly competitive.“It will be more challenging to raise capital in 2016 at every stage,” said Matt Holleran, general partner of Cloud Apps Capital.Specialize. Holleran is taking a market-focused approach with his venture capital fund. His team works exclusively with early-stage, cloud-based app startups.Sticking with one sector lets Holleran, a former Salesforce.com (CRM) exec, bring specific expertise and connections to prospective startups. The result is a matching of minds.“The right amount of capital from the right partners,” Holleran said.Pitch wisely.

1096,MS,"A takeout seems inevitable for troubled Web portal Yahoo (YHOO), which is seeing its core business continue to weaken, according to a report on Monday by Mizuho. The Japanese bank handed Yahoo a price-target boost in anticipation of an acquisition, and Yahoo stock rose.Mizuho raised its price target on Yahoo stock to 32 from 29, maintaining a neutral rating. Yahoo shares rose 1.3% to close at 31.79 in the stock market today.Yahoo is down 28% over the past 12 months amid concerns about the company's poor financial showing and its future, with some influential investors calling for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer to resign.Despite gains in its mobile business, Yahoo's unique visitor count is sinking, down 7% year-over-year in January, after a 5% drop in December and a 6% fall in November, Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi said in Monday’s industry note, citing comScore data.""In fact, January 2016 was the worst monthly decline in unique visitors we have ever seen for the company,"" wrote Doshi, with total time spent on Yahoo sites dropping for the first time, down 4%.""We expect Yahoo will be more vulnerable a year from now to losing users and ultimately ad dollars to larger platforms like Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and high-profile startups like Snapchat and Pinterest,"" Doshi said.With news reports of Yahoo's board looking to add two Starboard Value executives to its board, and Yahoo saying it will hire outside bankers, ""it seems like the board (and maybe or maybe not Ms. Mayer) ... (is) getting more aggressive with Yahoo and M&A,"" Doshi wrote. Verizon Communications' $4.4 billion acquisition of AOL last year ""can be viewed as a floor"" price for any potential Yahoo buyout, he said.Yahoo's directors are close to offering at least two board seats to Starboard, an activist hedge fund, in order to avert a proxy fight, according to a report on Friday in the New York Post. Starboard founder Jeff Smith is looking to oust Mayer and force a sale of the company's core Internet business.Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) ""remain the leading candidates to acquire Yahoo,"" said Doshi, adding that those companies could offer a higher price than private equity groups and that they have huge subscriber bases across Internet and TV and operate leading mobile services.""Each of these companies could easily absorb Yahoo, and with clear synergies to their businesses,"" Doshi said.Scott Rostan, founder and CEO of Training the Street, a group teaching corporate valuation and merger and acquisition skills, agrees.""AT&T, Verizon and Comcast are such large companies that this would be almost just like a little, bite-sized morsel that they'd be gobbling up,"" Rostan told IBD. ""The ability to do the transaction would be pretty easy for those companies. It would be more of a question of do they want (it) from a strategic standpoint.""Time (TIME) could be another possible strategic suitor, Rostan said. ""Imagine Yahoo Sports with Sports Illustrated somehow. Imagine Yahoo News with Time. Imagine Fortune with Yahoo Finance,"" he said. ""There could be some very interesting combinations that come out"" of such a deal.On Monday, Yahoo estimated that its restructuring effort would result in pretax charges of $64 million to $78 million, mostly in the current quarter. Of the total, $40 million to $48 million would be for severance pay and related cash expenditures, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.Yahoo announced on Feb. 2 that it would reduce its workforce by 15% by the end of 2016 and close offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan.

1098,MS,"The 2014 debut of Apple's Apple Watch and the release of the Google Glass computing eyewear the prior year stamped both tech giants as leading innovators of wearables.Except that neither Apple (AAPL) nor Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is actually the leading innovator in wearables. Microsoft (MSFT) is.At least, Microsoft is No. 1 worldwide when looking at patents for wearable-related technology, according to LexInnova, a patents-consulting firm.Microsoft has 757 wearables patent filings, Rana Pratap, LexInnova's principal consultant for technology, told IBD. At least 53 filings are directly related to wrist devices. Another 13 are related to eyewear.Netherlands-based Philips (PHG) is right behind in wearables-related intellectual property, with 756 wearables patents and patent applications. Alphabet, parent of Google, has 602 to place at No. 3, and the patent numbers drop off precipitously from there, says LexInnova, which recently researched the topic.Apple, for instance, has only 197 filings, says LexInnova. Wearables startup Fitbit (FIT) has 192 filings.That is a good bit of patent activity, but then again, this market is already generating a good bit of revenue.""We estimate the wearables market at $8.9 billion in wholesale device revenue in 2015,"" Cliff Raskind, an analyst for market research firm Strategy Analytics, told IBD.While some of Microsoft's wearables portfolio is getting old -- U.S. patents last no more than 20 years -- Pratap says that, collectively, the patents remain strong. So, Microsoft's wearables patent portfolio doesn't just have quantity, but also quality.LexInnova uses a proprietary algorithm involving about 50 factors, including patent age, the number of times a patent has been cited in other companies' patent filings, and court rejection of challenges to a patent, to judge the quality of patent portfolios, Pratap explains. Without giving details, he said Microsoft's is strong.But the ramifications of Microsoft’s wearables-patent activity are unclear. Satya Nadella, who was promoted to Microsoft CEO two years ago, is focused on companywide strategies designed to recharge Microsoft’s growth.Microsoft, like any company, could develop products based on its patents, license its patents or both. The company last month disclosed that it has signed 1,200 licensing agreements of all kinds since launching its IP licensing program in December 2003. One of the most recent agreements involved licensing wearables-related technology to Olio Devices, a niche watchmaker.""Maybe Microsoft has been watching what Google's doing (with technology licenses) and longingly remembering their big (operating system) licensing days,"" said Raskind. ""That could be where they are going with the Olio deal.""Pratap says 700 of Microsoft's wearables patents are based on Microsoft’s own research.""According to our analysis, 49 patents and applications (were) acquired from Tangis,"" he said. Microsoft acquired another seven from Osterhout Group and one was acquired from Antenova.So what, if anything, is Microsoft planning in wearables?""I'm not necessarily watching for a Microsoft wearables pop-up retail store next Christmas,"" said Amy Webb, founder of technology forecasting and strategy consulting firm Webbmedia Group.Webb and others say there are more lucrative, near-term markets for wearables for Microsoft to exploit with its portfolio. More on that in a moment...Microsoft's intellectual-property cache might surprise some. The company sells only one internally developed wearable product, the Band 2 fitness tracker bracelet, and executives say they will begin selling eyewear called HoloLens by April.Plus, executives rarely discuss Microsoft's large overall patent portfolio. Indeed, Microsoft declined to comment for this story.""Whenever we do a patent analysis like this, we find that the biggest (technology) companies in a sector have the most patent filings,"" Pratap said, thanks to their often large research-and-development units.R&D spending by Microsoft has been gradually rising since 2010, reaching $12 billion in 2015, according to market-statistics firm Statista.Pratap points out that Microsoft's wearables portfolio began before it had a wearables product line. The earliest relevant patents resulted from other research projects. Over time, these innovations were recognized as addressing the new wearables market.This is common for tech and manufacturing companies, he says.Like all successful technology innovators, Microsoft has much experience -- good and bad -- with developing products and licensing technology.The company's first hits were the MS-DOS and Window operating systems, both of which were licensed so extensively that Microsoft endured years of antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe.There have been notable failures, too. Microsoft intellectual property was used to develop the firm's Zune digital music hardware. Microsoft also licensed Zune technology. Neither approach could save the entertainment player, which was discontinued last fall.Webb says developing products and licensing technology each have advantages and disadvantages.Licensing intellectual property typically brings modest, low-risk and ongoing revenue. A disadvantage of licensing is that it can put the licensee in the background when the technology succeeds in someone else's product.Development costs more compared with licensing and puts any failure in a company's lap. But the potential revenue upside is far larger, and the company is tied visibly to market success.While Webb says she has not had any contact with Microsoft regarding wearables, she feels the company is not likely to focus its related intellectual property solely or even primarily on consumer goods like fitness trackers.She said the most immediate market is for business-to-business applications (as was the case for MS-DOS), and what she calls ""B-to-D"" -- business-to-doctor. Health-monitoring and diagnostic roles for wearables are growing today, and they should continue to expand as medical wearables become small, inexpensive and sophisticated, Webb said.But rival Apple is making an aggressive bid to invade health care with mobile devices and HealthKit, the company's software platform for health-related applications.According to Black Book Market Research, almost 70% of physicians using medical apps do so on iPhones. That is a size-14 foot in the door for Apple.Webb says the promise of significant new revenue and the need to keep Apple at bay are likely to persuade Nadella to sift Microsoft's patent portfolio for related innovations.

1099,MS,"Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) would make perfect buyers for sagging Yahoo (YHOO), says investment bank Mizuho Securities.All three companies ""would be willing to bid aggressively for Yahoo in order to gain access to Yahoo's user base and online advertising assets,"" wrote Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi in a research note Thursday. ""There is no shame in selling the core business to a strategic buyer. Tim Armstrong sold AOL to Verizon for $4.4 billion, an impressive outcome for most parties involved.""Yahoo's board also ""seems to be at odds"" with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and the two-year strategic plan that she recently proposed, Doshi said. ""This rift could be exacerbated if the board gets compelling offers that Ms. Mayer is not willing to accept. We haven't come across many investors that are thrilled about Mayer's two-year strategic plan, so we're not optimistic that she will have success on this front.""Almost all of Yahoo's current value stems from its stake in China Internet powerhouse Alibaba Group (BABA).The company's turnaround plan includes continued investment in what the company calls ""Mavens,""  an acronym for Yahoo's mobile, video, native advertising and social businesses, where its ad revenue is growing.Mayer said the Web portal will narrow its focus to four areas -- news, sports, finance and lifestyle.  ""A simplified Yahoo will yield better focus, execution and increase shareholder value,"" she said in the company's Q4 earnings conference call.Mayer reportedly will further outline her turnaround plan before two major hedge funds that are major Yahoo shareholders, Millennium Partners and Mason Capital, according to a report Wednesday in the New York Post.That news report comes on the heels of Mayer's hiring of Manhattan-based Innisfree M&A to help recruit investor support, as activist investor Jeff Smith of Starboard Value pushes for Mayer to leave.Yahoo this month said it would cut 15% of its workforce, close five non-U.S. offices and look to sell non-core divisions and assets, such as patents and real estate, as part of a strategic plan to return the company to modest-though-accelerating growth in 2017 and 2018.By year-end, Yahoo said it anticipates having about 9,000 employees and fewer than 1,000 contractors, representing a workforce that is 42% smaller than it was in 2012. It expects to save $400 million a year in short-term operating expenses from these cuts.Yahoo stock, up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 31, has tumbled nearly 40% since the start of 2015.

1100,MS,"Hillary Clinton has never been asked whether she verbally intimidated alleged rape survivor Juanita Broaddrick. Nor has Clinton been asked whether she spearheaded the so-called “nuts and sluts” strategy to silence and intimidate women who alleged affairs with or sexual abuse by Bill Clinton.The books “Hell to Pay” by Barbara Olson and “No One Left to Lie To” by Christopher Hitchens depict Hillary Clinton as the puppet master behind the hiring of lawyers and private detectives to dig up dirt on her husband's accusers.Bolstering the credibility of Hitchens’ book is a foreword written by respected historian Douglas Brinkley, a frequent guest on CNN, MSNBC and other networks.Is this true?Attorney Larry Klayman, who worked in the U.S. Justice Department, runs Freedom Watch, a government watchdog group. He founded Judicial Watch, also a watchdog group, which was, at one time, known as Bill Clinton's ""nemesis."" But Judicial Watch also filed lawsuits against President George W. Bush's administration for its alleged improprieties.Klayman has represented nearly all of Bill Clinton’s best-known accusers, including Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers and Dolly Kyle Browning.I recently asked him about Hillary’s role, if any, in impugning these women.Elder: “Why do you suppose has Hillary never -- to my knowledge -- been asked, point-blank, ‘Did you or did you not verbally intimidate an alleged rape survivor by the name Juanita Broaddrick, as she alleges you did?’”Klayman: “I don’t think anybody’s had the guts to do it. ... But the hard reality here is ... Hillary Clinton started what was called the ‘war room.’ ... This is ... in the campaign of 1992, which elected her husband. George Stephanopoulos was part of that. James Carville was part of it.“And the purpose of the war room -- and Stephanopoulos ... of course ... doesn’t want to discuss this -- was to destroy any woman that would challenge Bill Clinton, because she knew, undoubtedly, that if her husband didn’t make it to the White House, that someday she wouldn’t make it to the White House, either.“... She wanted to protect her own interests, and to do that she had to destroy the women who she knew were going to come forward and reveal the alleged sexual harassment and rape, and the intimidation that was about ready to be leveled against these women to keep them quiet.”Elder: “What can you tell us about what Hillary did? What was her role in all of this?”Klayman: “We know from the various women who had contact. Some of them had contact with Hillary Clinton in Arkansas. They know her way of doing business. ... And Stephanopoulos and Carville himself effectively admitted it when they did that documentary, ‘The War Room.’“It was Hillary who was at the top of that. She was the one who called the shots. And the private detectives who were sicced on these women ... were hired by Hillary Clinton. I took the deposition of (one) and confirmed that (he was) hired through Hillary’s lawyer.“So there’s a lot of different evidence here, direct and circumstantial, that places Hillary at the center of these acts against the women.”Elder: “The most serious allegation, of course, is the one by Juanita Broaddrick. She claims that when Bill Clinton was Arkansas attorney general, he raped her, and two weeks later, at some campaign function, Hillary came up to her and verbally intimidated her, saying things to her, according to Broaddrick, that made it clear: Keep your mouth shut, or else.”Klayman: “One of the private detectives broke into her house and took an answering-machine tape ... to make sure there was no evidence of what had occurred. These were the kind of things that have been done. ... They would have the private detectives -- for instance, Kathleen Willey experienced this -- she was riding her bike one day and one of these private detectives, or one of his agents, rode up to her on another bike and mentioned the names of her children in a very sinister way. ‘How are your children, Ms. Willey?’“In fact, that happened to me during a deposition at Judicial Watch, where one of the lawyers that were representing the Clintons -- shortly after my daughter was born -- mentioned her name. And there was no way of knowing that. They wanted us to know that they were watching us ... that we were at risk.”Elder: “I’ve interviewed Kathleen Willey, and I’ve said to her, as I’m saying to you, when people came by and made threats and said names and suggested she should ‘watch it,’ you still can’t trace that to Hillary.”Klayman: “In a court of law, it’s not just direct but circumstantial evidence. I gave you a little bit of it. ... If you add it all up ... it creates a pattern where she’s capable of almost anything.”Hillary Clinton once said that when women allege sexual assault, they “have the right to be believed.” Let’s leave it at this -- for now.            Elder is an author and talk-show host based in Los Angeles.

1102,MS,"Bank of America and Morgan Stanley reported Q4 and full-year earnings that highlighted big banks' tough revenue environment amid low interest rates and a sagging energy sector.Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America (BAC) earned 28 cents a share in Q4, up 12% from a year earlier and beating by 2 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 3.2% to $19.6 billion, missing estimates of $19.8 billion.Full-year EPS was $1.38, beating views by 3 cents. EPS for 2014 was 36 cents, due in large part to massive legal bills, including a mortgage-related settlement worth nearly $17 billion that BofA paid out to regulators. Full-year revenue was $84.2 billion, down 1% from 2014's total but beating views of $84.1 billion.As of Dec. 31, 2015, total assets rose 1.9% to $2.14 trillion. Total deposits rose 7% to $1.2 trillion. Excluding an accounting adjustment, trading revenue rose 11% year over year to $2.65 billion, but tumbled 16% compared to Q3's total.Consumer banking revenue barely rose — just 0.4% — to $7.8 billion. Global banking revenue inched upward 0.9% to $4.4 billion.Non-performing loans, leases and foreclosed properties fell 22.1% to $9.8 billion. Allowance for loan and lease losses fell 15.2% to $12.2 billion.Reflecting declining oil prices, commercial loan defaults rose by $75 million, and BofA has set aside $144 million to prepare for future defaults in its portfolio. CFO Paul Donofrio said during BofA's earnings conference call Tuesday that the bank's $21.3 billion energy portfolio comprises only 2% of its overall loans.Expenses fell 2% to $13.9 billion. Headcount fell 5% to 213,280 employees. The number of BofA branches fell 3% to 4,726.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley (MS) earned 43 cents a share excluding items during the fourth quarter, beating estimates by 10 cents.The New York-based bank earned 39 cents a share once costs were included. In Q4 2014, the bank reported a loss of $1.6 billion, or 91 cents a share, as a result of a $2.6 billion settlement over the sale of mortgage bonds.Fourth-quarter revenue fell 1.8% to $7.9 billion excluding items, beating views for $7.6 billion. With items included, Morgan Stanley earned $7.7 billion.Full-year EPS was $2.70, compared with $1.39 in 2014. Full-year revenue rose 2.8% to $34.5 billion, missing estimates of $35.1 billion.Investment banking revenue fell 10.3% to $1.31 billion. Fees from advising on deals rose 5.7% to $516 million, while underwriting debt fees slumped 25.1% to $346 million. Employee pay and benefits fell 10% to $16 billion.

1105,MS,"Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) looks likely to hold onto the ""world's most valuable"" company title, surging more than 5% after the market close on its quarterly earnings release that beat estimates.Alphabet took the title from Apple (AAPL) in early-afternoon trading, squeaking past Apple’s $533 billion market cap.Alphabet stock closed 1.2% higherin the stock market today, while Apple stock was down 0.9%. At the closing bell, Apple grabbed back the market-cap lead, with $534.7 billion vs. Alphabet's $530.1 billion.Apple's disappointing guidance last week, when it posted its December-quarter earnings, sent its shares falling. Analysts were expecting an 18% EPS gain for Alphabet, the third straight quarter of accelerating growth. The company reported earnings excluding items up 26% to $8.67 a share from the year-earlier quarter, the 5th straight quarter of accelerating growth. FactSet had expected $8.08, while analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $8.09.It's a milestone for Alphabet and a major turnaround from where things stood at the end of 2014. Then, iPhone maker Apple carried a market value of $643 billion, almost twice Google’s $361 billion market value.Then Google reorganized as Alphabet, retaining its core search, YouTube, Android and related operations under Google, the largest business within Alphabet. The company’s largely money-losing, non-search endeavors in health care, self-driving cars, drones, fast broadband, smart home devices and other speculative areas moved to Alphabet, and the company has pledged to break out their profits and losses, starting with the Q4 earnings report.Investors applauded the moves, as well as the hiring of new CFO Ruth Porat in March from Morgan Stanley (MS) with a goal of even more expense control at the world’s largest Internet search firm.Alphabet and Facebook (FB) are capturing the most display ad revenue, and Alphabet is releasing new video and mobile products expected to bring further growth as advertising budgets increasingly shift from print and TV to digital.At the same time, Apple has struggled to come up with another trend-setting product amid slowing growth for its most important device -- the nearly nine-year-old iPhone, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of Apple's overall sales.Apple has already acknowledged the iPhone will begin this year with its first quarterly sales decline since it debuted in 2007.Microsoft (MSFT) ($432 billion), Facebook (FB) ($327 billion) and Amazon.com (AMZN) ($269 billion) are the next three highest-valued tech stocks in the S&P 500. Like Alphabet’s stock, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all hit record highs in late 2015. Microsoft fell 0.7% on Monday, Facebook rose 2.6% to a new high. Amazon sank 2.1%, extending losses from Friday.BGP Financial analyst Colin Gillis believes the potential changing of the guard reflects a wider recognition that Alphabet is fostering a ""culture of innovation,"" while Apple has lost some of its mojo since the October 2011 death of co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs. ""I no longer see a sense of urgency at Apple,"" Gillis told IBD.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1107,MS,"The opinions expressed in this article by Matt Levine are his and not those of Bloomberg News.Blythe Masters' Digital Asset Holdings continues to make blockchain inroads, and I continue not to quite understand it. The latest is ""a trial project"" with JPMorgan, which is ""looking at several applications for the technology, including addressing liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, which normally let investors take out their money at short notice -- even though the underlying assets can require much more time to sell."" People are worried about loan market liquidity, but they are soothing their worries with the blockchain.The traditional liquidity-mismatch worry is that you can take money out of a fund quickly, but it takes a longer time to find a buyer for the underlying assets at an acceptable price. This appears to address a slightly different worry, one of settlement timing: If you ask for your money back, and you get it in three days, and meanwhile JPMorgan was easily able to find a buyer for the underlying loan at a reasonable price, but it takes two weeks to settle that trade, then JPMorgan (JPM) is floating you money while it waits to get paid. Which is not optimal for JPMorgan. Still:Mr. Pinto said loans were a good place to start trialing blockchain technology, because “the settlement process is complex with lots of manual intervention and multiple parties.""See, this is the part I don't understand. If you think the blockchain is a better database than other databases, then replacing other databases with blockchains is a good idea. If your settlement process, for legal or customary or whatever reasons, requires lots of manual intervention from multiple parties, then just looking into a mirror and saying ""blockchain!"" three times won't solve that. You have to go to all those multiple parties and convince them to stop intervening manually. Once you've done that, sure, set up an electronic database. Maybe a blockchain, why not. But the problems here seem to be prior to the choice of database architecture. The last time we talked about Digital Asset, just over a week ago, it was because it had won a contract with the Australian Stock Exchange, and the explanation of why that was an ideal place to start trying out blockchain was the opposite of what it is here: Stock settlement in Australia is not a complex process with lots of manual intervention; it's a fully dematerialized stock market with a single centralized repository of stock information. It's just an electronic database, and Digital Asset thinks it has a better database.Meanwhile, bizarrely, ""a unit of Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the dominant processor of repurchase agreements, or repos, between securities dealers, has told traders it will stop facilitating certain interbank repos as of July 15."" Specifically, dealers who clear through JPMorgan will no longer be able to do general collateral finance repos with dealers who clear through Bank of New York Mellon (BK). The problem seems to be a ... failure of databases?In an effort to align interdealer GCF trades and other repos, BNY, J.P. Morgan and DTCC set out to build new technology for swapping information about the cash and securities being exchanged between clients of the clearing banks.J.P. Morgan completed a series of enhancements, and the DTCC unit completed the majority of its own, but BNY determined that the technology work would have taken too much time and resources, people familiar with the situation said.If only JPMorgan had access to a magical kind of database that made clearing quick and easy while also somehow effortlessly solving interpersonal problems.""Chinese police have arrested more than 20 people associated with 'a complete Ponzi scheme' that allegedly took more than 50 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) from investors,"" and I like the rigor there in distinguishing ""a complete Ponzi scheme"" from, you know, a little bit Ponzi. Lots of semi-to-not-at-all-legitimate businesses have a bit of a Ponzi to them; if you're running a fraud anyway, sometimes you might have to take money from a new investor to pay an old investor to go away. But the Ponzi as a complete business model, especially in enormous size, is less common. This alleged full Ponzi was called Ezubao; it was (ostensibly) a peer-to-peer lending platform, and its ""risk controller, who is also under detention, was quoted by Xinhua as admitting that '95% of [our] projects are fake.' "" I guess that leaves 5% of not-Ponzi though.According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, QED Benchmark Management LLC and its founder/fund manager Peter Kuperman avoided disclosing heavy trading losses to investors by using a misleading mixture of hypothetical and actual returns when providing the fund’s performance history. After obtaining millions of dollars from investors based on these misrepresentations, QED Benchmark and Kuperman deviated from their stated investment strategy and poured most of the fund’s assets into a single penny stock.I would score this one as about zero percent Ponzi, but it's very odd. From the Securities and Exchange Commission order, it seems that QED Benchmark poured a bunch of money into stock and convertible debentures of a company called Emo Capital Corp. Emo's stock did not trade much. QED Benchmark kept marking up its holdings. Then the stock started falling. QED Benchmark negotiated a ""put option"" with Emo's promoters, under which QED Benchmark could sell the stock to the promoters at 72 cents, even though the market price was in the mid-40-cents. QED Benchmark paid nothing for this in-the-money put. ""The fund administrator accepted this document as evidence of the holdings’ value, and the fund’s statements to investors reflected a 72-cent valuation for the next six months."" After that, with the stock now down to 4.3 cents per share, ""Kuperman told the fund administrator that he and the put issuer would 'retire the existing March 72-cent put and replace it with (a) Dec. $1 put.' "" At this point, the administrator had had enough:So we are expected to believe that a third party would give you the right to sell nearly 4 million shares of a stock at $1 per share, even though its current price is roughly 4 cents per share, in exchange for absolutely nothing?The “put” had an intrinsic value of nearly $3.7 million and a third party sold it to you for zero?I don’t think so.Right on, administrator. Who was scamming whom, exactly, here? Kuperman agreed to reimburse his investors and pay $75,000 to the SEC.In other fraud news, Robert Bray was convicted of insider trading in a case that involved both golf and cocktail napkins:As the government proved at trial, in June 2010, Bray was tipped by a friend who was an executive at Boston-based Eastern Bank Corp. (“Eastern Bank”) that Wainwright would be acquired. The tip -- more than two weeks before the acquisition was publicly announced -- was passed on a napkin slipped to Bray over drinks at a country club bar in Watertown where both men are members. On Monday, June 14, 2010, Bray called his broker to ask how he could buy 25,000 shares of Wainwright stock, which he acknowledged “kinda sounds crazy,” given how thinly the stock traded.Turns out, it was. We discussed this case when Bray was charged in August 2014; it was the second insider trading case brought that summer at the same country club. There must be something in the water, or the cocktails, or the cocktail napkins.Also there is this:Last month, an undercover federal agent set up an account with Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency exchange based in Costa Rica. Registering online, the agent entered the name “Joe Bogus,” typed the account name as “tostealeverything,” and chose the address “123 Fake Main Street.”And:He transmitted hundreds of LR dollars between the Joe Bogus account and another undercover account, identifying one transaction as “your share of the cashout” and another “for the cocaine.”I am tempted to say ""if a user on your money-transfer site identifies a transaction as 'for the cocaine,' then he is a cop,"" but that's not right. That's how like half of transactions on Venmo are identified, and it never stops being hilarious. And I'm still writing dumb jokes in the ""memo"" field of my checks. But I like imagining these undercover FBI agents thinking hard about how real criminals would transfer money, and concluding that identifying the transfers as ""for the cocaine"" added exactly the right touch of verisimilitude.Ahh, millennials.Here's apparently an investing thesis?“People want to buy happiness,” Huang said at a London cafe in January. “An experience is unique because it gives them that in three stages: the anticipation, the event itself, and the memories after. Not only does that final stage last forever, but you can also share it.”The thesis that results from this is long companies that sell experiences (and happiness), short companies that sell goods. There is sort of a meta-thesis, though, which is that if the rising millennial generation is interested in authentic experiences and not the accumulation of wealth, won't that be bad for stock-market inflows? Anyway, in other news, ""the biggest 'robo-advisers' are relying on old-school call centers and blog posts to calm anxious investors, trying to persuade them that there is no need to abandon the algorithms in times of heightened volatility."" I hope the call center dialogue goes like this:YOU: I'm panicking, I tell ya, panicking! Sell everything!EERIE ROBOT VOICE: I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.YOU: Who is Dave?Naked shorts.People get really mad about naked short selling, so much so that Gretchen Morgenson wrote a column about Goldman Sachs' (GS) naked-shorting settlement that ends with a quote from a guy who ... seems not to have read the settlement?In an interview, Mr. Shapiro, a former federal prosecutor and United States attorney, questioned the recent SEC settlement. “I’m very curious to understand what Goldman Sachs admitted to the SEC,” he said, “and why $15 million was considered to be an adequate punishment.”I mean, you can just read the settlement! (I wrote about it a couple of weeks ago.) Basically Goldman admitted that it used a dumb method for giving ""locates"" to clients that wanted to short stocks. This dumb method might, on the surface, look like it would allow an unacceptably large amount of naked shorting, but in fact it didn't -- ""Goldman’s rate of failures remained low and did not substantially change"" while it used the dumb method -- which might explain why $15 million was considered to be an adequate punishment.Elsewhere in market-structure-ish stuff, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq ""are so upset the SEC didn’t offer either of them a seat on the agency’s Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee that they have spurned offers by the panel to participate in policy deliberations held by its members behind closed doors."" And my Bloomberg View colleague Michael Lewis has extremely odd ideas about Occupy Wall Street and IEX.Are bankers evil, etc.Here is Elizabeth Warren's report on ""Rigged Justice: 2016: How Weak Enforcement Lets Corporate Offenders Off Easy."" It includes the claim that the foreign-exchange fixing scandal involved banks who ""for more than five years manipulated exchange rates in a way that made the banks billions of dollars at the expense of clients and investors."" That seems like a wild overestimate to me: I think the absolute cap on revenue from FX fixing is under $2 billion, and I suspect it's orders of magnitude less. It strikes me as unproductive to assume that all bank scandals are the same size. Libor manipulation was big! Mortgage fraud was bigger! FX was sort of medium-size at worst.Here is a symposium at Concurring Opinions on the book ""Better Bankers, Better Banks."" Here is a story about how the outside monitor's report on HSBC (HSBC) will be made public. Here is ""Does Regulation Crowd out Private Ordering and Reputational Capital?"" And Maureen Sherry, a former managing director at Bear Stearns who wrote an opinion piece titled ""A Colleague Drank My Breast Milk and Other Wall Street Tales,"" has also written a novel about Wall Street, ""a breezy comedy in the style of 'Bridget Jones’s Diary'"":In a good year, Isabelle earns $3 million. Ms. Sherry said she considered how that would play to readers, but she wanted to be realistic. “I hate the term ‘Manhattan poor,’ ” she said, but added that after taxes, as a couple with one income and three private-school tuitions, “They weren’t living large.”People are worried about unicorns.""There were no U.S. IPOs in January, the first monthlong drought since September 2011,"" and people are worried about unicorns that might not be able to do initial public offerings:The fate of biotechnology companies is most in focus. While an IPO slowdown is problematic for all sorts of companies, including the technology sector in which dozens of companies have raised money privately at billion-dollar implied valuations, biotech is getting special scrutiny from investors because the sector is widely viewed as the most vulnerable to diminishing access to public funding.Elsewhere, this possibly parodic essay about ""How Soylent and Oculus Could Fix The Prison System"" (samples: ""I believe we could fix all of these problems using the Silicon Valley idea of 'first principles,' or boiling down a problem to its core and building a new solution from the ground up""; ""I’d outsource the laundry to FlyCleaners to save on facilities and admin""; ""You’d weigh in on a Fitbit Aria scale, so they could digitally track your weight alongside your other vitals"") should make you worry about unicorns. Meanwhile at Bloomberg Gadfly, Rani Molla asks how big Uber could get.People are worried about bond market liquidity.Start your week of worrying off right with ""'Seismic' shock awaits bond liquidity."" The particular shock involved here is the European Mifid II pre-trade transparency rules, which worry people:A senior executive at a large U.S. fund company, who requested anonymity, said: “Our head of fixed-income trading says that if he didn’t have young children, he would retire the day this comes in. It is not going to be pretty. It would undoubtedly affect liquidity.”The concern is that the rules will treat many illiquid bonds as liquid, require pre-trade transparency and firm quotes, and generally make it hard to negotiate trades.Things happen.

Revenue rose 3.2% to $19.6 billion, missing estimates of $19.8 billion.Full-year EPS was $1.38, beating views by three cents.

1126,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw double-digit bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter, thanks to lower litigation expenses and a strong performance from its consumer bank division.The nation's largest bank earned $1.32 a share, up 10.9% from a year earlier and 7 cents ahead of estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Net income was $5.4 billion. Revenue rose 0.8% to $23.7 billion, topping views for $22.9 billion.Full-year earnings per share rose 13.4% to $6 a share. Full-year revenue declined 1.3% to $96.6 billion.JPMorgan is the first bank to report quarterly and full-year earnings after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point last month. Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) report Friday.JPMorgan's net interest margin, the difference between the interest it charges on loans vs. what it pays out to depositors, increased to 2.23% compared with 2.16% in the third quarter.The bank's shares rose 1.5% to 58.20 after sinking nearly 3% on Wednesday and 13% in 2016 to an 11-month closing low. Wells Fargo climbed 1.8% to 50.64, and Citigroup advanced less than 1% to 45.38.Energy 'Stress'In a prepared statement, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon saluted the bank's ""strong loan growth and credit quality"" but warned of ""some stress in energy.""Tumbling oil prices have been blamed in part for the year's awful start in the stock market, which hurt banks' trading revenue. Also, if the Fed doesn't raise interest rates as quickly as originally thought, that may hurt banks' profitability this year.The bank's provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, up 49%, reflecting an increase in reserves of $149 million, with $124 million in the oil and gas portfolio and $35 million in mining.The fact that its energy credit reserves are modest suggests that JPMorgan isn't hitting the panic button when it comes to commodities, said Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""The fact they're not building more reserves ... suggests they don't see the need to build more. The commentary on energy credit was pretty supportive.""As of Dec. 31, JPMorgan's total assets fell 9% to $2.4 trillion. Total loans grew 11% to $837.3 billion. Excluding credit card loans, consumer loans surged 17% to $344.8 billion. Wholesale loans rose 9% to $361 billion. Credit card loans rose a fraction to $131.5 billion.Deposits DownTotal deposits fell 6% to $1.3 trillion. Head count dropped 3% to 234,598 employees.Legal expenses for Q4 were $644 million, down more than 41% from a year earlier. For 2015, legal expenses were $3 billion.Consumer banking net income rose 10% to $2.4 billion. Total non-interest expenses fell 7% to $14.3 billion as JPMorgan and other banks looked to curb expenses in a slow environment.The bank's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio — which measures core equity capital and indicates a bank's financial strength — was 11.8% in the fourth quarter compared with 10.2% the year before.Net income at JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank surged 80% to $1.7 billion, thanks to lower legal expenses.Investment banking revenue fell 11% to $1.5 billion. Lower debt underwriting fees were offset in part by higher advisory fees. Fixed-income trading revenue fell 3% to $2.6 billion due to reduced activity in commodities and credit markets.Rounding out the six largest U.S. banks, Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report earnings on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs (GS) reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs is mulling big cuts to its fixed-income staff, reports say.Bank of America rose 0.6% to 14.99.

1127,MS,"And the FLUSH continues......by now I am even wondering....who is the TAIL wagging the DOG?   Have we just allowed the roles to reverse?  Can the Chinese stock mkt really hold this much sway over global mkts?   I mean - it's the Chinese stock mkt..... it says nothing about the state of the Chinese economy.......their mkt is not connected to their economy the way Europe and the US is.....I mean our mkts are developed, liquid and thick......everything the China mkt is NOT.(Let me remind you....it is an EMERGING mkt, not very thick and not very liquid, difficult to trade and subject to rule set changes on the fly......)That being said - the Chinese economy IS important to the global economy - no doubt - but my argument is that the Chinese economy is NOT nearly as gloomy as the most recent performance of the Shanghei Index.The Shanghei Index shot up 40% from February 2015 to June 2015   (4 months),  the same move in the S&P at that time would have meant....we went from 2,020 to 2,828  - a bit ridiculous no and very unlikely...............and it was not like the concerns about a slowing China did not exist.....they  did - but no one seemed to care......Chinese RETAIL investors  and some global asset managers were tripping over each other to buy stocks as the search for yield continued..........So what happened?  Well - oil started to crack in June -  when it was trading at $60/barrel, global investment banks began to forecast a break in oil and concerns over weaker commodities, concerns over a slowing Europe (or so they told us), and the increasing likelihood of a change in US FED policy etc. all contributed to a change in mind set.........Aisle 1 - REALITY CHECK!So as the global weakness story builds - they start to run for exits - the Chinese authorities then impose new regulations on the fly....causing more anxiety and  concern.....so that 40% move higher in 4 months does a 180 and collapses under its own weight - taking that mkt right back to where it was almost 1 yr ago....but has the Chinese economy story really changed that much?  No - and that was made clear in the Alcoa  (AA) earnings on Monday......Klaus Kleinfeld is looking at China as an opportunity and not as a drag on his businesses....What will other earnings reports say?  We are about to find out......In spite of deeply oversold mkt, investors continue to be fearful..... The fear trade continues to be gain momentum  - 'selling begets more selling......and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy...... fear of the 'possible' of weak earnings, fear of an imploding China (unlikely), fear of the FED (overblown), fear of a slowing Europe (in fact not happening),  never mind fear over renewed geo-political issues - all coming together - to paint a picture of doom and gloom.....Remember - mkts tend to overshoot especially when the HERD mentality takes over.....Technically, the S&P is now testing the August lows and is in a deeply oversold  condition.  Note that on January 8th - the 50 dma crossed over the 200 dma - sending out that 'death cross' signal......an indicator that signals a bear mkt on the horizon.....but I have found that by the time the death cross happens - most of the move lower has already happened and in fact it tends to find support and begin the process of repair......I am still willing to bet that this will be the case here as well....That does not mean it rallies right back to S&P 2000. it just means that it churns as the mkt assesses the latest damage vs. the outlook........and the outlook  will become  clearer over the next couple of weeks as the qtrly confessional period heats up.......... Earnings will have to completely blow up for the mkt to implode....Speaking of -

1135,MS,"Stocks struggled yesterday as a weak US eco data point revealed that pending home sales fell by 0.9% vs. the +0.2% expectation and another decline in oil prices ripped thru the mkts.....sending the broader mkt a bit lower while energy stocks went into a tailspin...or at least that is what they want you to believe.... Look - the curtain is about to come down on 2015, volumes light, asset managers taking advantage of some last min window dressing - traders jumping in and out as they try to ring the register....and the mkt did not collapse at all.  We remain well entrenched in the trading range we have been discussing which will leave us essentially flat on the year - add in dividends and maybe the S&P registers a small gain of 2%.....Chalk it up and let's move on.  Yes...oil fell by 3+%, - ending the day at $36.60/barrel,  crude oil supplies rose by 2.9 mil barrels and the Saudi's re-iterated their commitment to keep producing oil at a record pace to try and choke out everyone else.....Ok..but this is getting a bit long in the tooth now, no?  This has the story and will continue to be part of the story in 2016, so there is nothing new here at all...... Themes for 2016......oh boy.....This is sure to set up for an interesting year.....First we have the US Presidential election - and while the Democrats seem to have already anointed their candidate - the Republicans are still trying to clear the field.  There are still some 11 GOP candidates in the race - it is time for them to bow out and coalesce around SOMEONE - my sense is that the longer this circus drags on - the weaker the party gets.....Someone needs to take control... Next up - the FED and Monetary Policy  - Do we need to discuss?  Third will be a continued focus on China and the role it is playing in the global economy..... Fears of a continued slowdown will permeate the analysis and chatter - How will the global economy respond? Next - Oil - is the worst over or will we see another leg down and if we do - what are the implications for the world economy?   Yesterday - the IMF's (International Monetary Fund) Chief - Ms. Christine Lagarde - warned us of 'disappointing global growth for 2016' -  How's that for a  'Happy New Year Toast!' And the list goes on..... Technically speaking - we continue to get mixed signals from the mkts - We have a long term signal  that is hovering on the edge.....suggesting the beginning of a pullback....  Add this to the range of other early warnings - indexes that have already entered bear mkts and you need to at least be aware of a broader mkt pullback.   This signal is nothing more than the simple 10-month exponential moving average on the S&P 500 Index.  Back in August - this signal flashed a HUGE warning as the mkt crashed........ The October rally  took it back up and thru resistance on the S&P - causing some to think it was just an aberration.....Since then, the S&P has gone mostly sideways, gradually turning lower again in December - bit still not sending the definitive signal....which is why we are 'hovering'....Next look at the DOW Industrials vs. the DOW Transports.  If we are to believe that the bulls remain in control then the Transportation Index should be mimicking the Industrial index, according to the DOW Theory - which it is NOT. Since November -  the transportation index has been in a harsh and steady decline - vs. the sideways pattern of the industrials.   The decline in the Transports reflects a lack of shipping demand. So, regardless of headline reports about how much Amazon shipped and the role that UPS and FEDEX played - raw materials and finished goods are in serious trouble — evidence of serious demand degradation. Now I am not screaming FIRE at all - I am just putting it on the table to consider....add in the  'unknown exposure'  in the derivative mkts and you can see how it could get a bit dicey. Think August 24th....... (and I say unknown for a reason - because it IS UNKNOWN - no matter what they tell you.... - think the housing crisis and all of the insurance products created to protect everyone from loss - REALLY???)  I'm just sayin.......   If - like in August - the mkt hits a pocket of air and goes into free fall - the additional pressure created by all of the varied 'synthetic products' - products that are highly leveraged -  will only exacerbate the move......and then we'll get another SEC report 8 months later -  that will try to explain the move.......it's fairly simple - They have allowed the level of complication and risk to rise beyond what is reasonably considered to be controllable.......what do we need to see next to wake them up?This morning we see global mkts under a bit of pressure and as the year ends here are the ytd numbers: Japan +9.9%, Hong Kong -7%, China +9.4%, ASX -2.1% FTSE -4.8%, CAC 40 +9%, DAX +9.5%, EUROSTOXX +4.1%, SPAIN -7%, ITALY +12.6%US Futures are flat this morning.....as the S&P  ended the day at 2063 yesterday - essentially flat on the year.  I suspect that they will work hard to close the mkt above 2058 and they may even try to rally it to 2100......(wishful thinking.). For us - the year looks like this:  DOW -1.2%, S&P +0.22%, Nasdaq +7%.Let me take a min to thank each and every one of you for being a Morning Thoughts reader.   I appreciate the comments that you send back as I try to respond to everyone that  offers opinion or analysis.  It has been my pleasure to both feed you financially as well as physically.  I hope you enjoy the 'boots on the ground' down home style.  I wish each of you - continued good health, prosperity and love of family and friends as we enter the new year.    Take Good CareKPKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

So it’s anyone’s call on what’s next.
"
1139,MS,"Investors and the mkts expect both the ECB to add more stimulus and for the FED to move on rates while remaining cautious in the months ahead, anything short of those expectations will cause the mkts to convulse meaning that if Uncle Mario Draghi does not deliver or that the mkt senses that Yellen (or other Fed members) thinks the economy is 'over heating'- thus sending the message that rates will rise faster and steeper than expected — then watch for a major revaluation of asset prices.

1140,MS,"I think the biggest risk is what the FED says next and how they say it. The problem is that when you have 12 people trying to say something — it is never the same message, the wording, the intonation, the body language, the slight wink or awkward smile all reveal how that person really feels. So after they move on rates in December investors/traders will want to know what the plan is going forward. When can we expect the next move?  Can we assume that 25 bps increases will be the norm?  Does the FED think that the US economy is overheating causing new speculation on the rate/pace of further tightening?  All very valid questions — and the economic macro data is telling.

So it’s anyone’s call on what’s next.Investors and the mkts expect both the ECB to add more stimulus and for the FED to move on rates while remaining cautious in the months ahead, anything short of those expectations will cause the mkts to convulse meaning that if Uncle Mario Draghi does not deliver or that the mkt senses that Yellen (or other Fed members) thinks the economy is 'over heating'- thus sending the message that rates will rise faster and steeper than expected — then watch for a major revaluation of asset prices.

1154,MS,"“Were the [Fed] to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals,” she said. “Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.”  The longer she spoke the worse it got....the Twitter sphere, the business news channels offering up min by min analysis.....what did that word mean?  What did that sentence mean?  Did you see the look on her face - surely that must mean that rates are not going to rise or maybe she is just playing us....????  Blah, blah, blah....and so we have more of the same.  And today we get to do it all again as Janet now addresses the Jt Economic Committee of Congress....expect more of the same again......it's exhausting really......all this transparency is BS......In the end - she made it clear that she is ready.....enough of the foreplay......let's get to it!

1164,MS,"The Federal Reserve Board proposed long-awaited rules for reining in losses from institutions deemed ""too big to fail."" It requires the eight largest banks to raise a total of $120 billion in debt that could be converted into equity in a crisis.New guidelines, known as ""total loss-absorbing capacity,"" or TLAC, will increase the amount of capital, defined as a combination of shareholder equity and debt, that large banks will need to have. Regulators believe that banks need bigger cushions in case of crises like the one in 2008 that required taxpayer bailouts.The Fed set the TLAC at a minimum 18% of risk-weighted assets. Banks affected by the rules will have until January 2022 to comply, although a months-long comment period will occur before the Fed issues a final rule.Some of the largest banks will need to have more capacity.

During the last several years, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) each has paid billions of dollars to the state and federal governments to resolve similar allegations.Goldman shares fell 0.8% to 203.44 by early afternoon in the stock market today.

1413,MS,"the Obama administration Clinton is close to.Hillary Clinton has made a career out of wanting to be president of the United States. But in all this elapsed time she's never been able or bothered to explain Why she wants the nation's highest office.The Clintons clearly feel entitled to many things. One of them should not be the Oval Office. (Scroll down for video of 'Saturday Night Live's' searing, hilarious parody of Clinton's announcement.)Now that Hillary is officially in the race for the Democrat nomination and, according to party polls, dominating the vacant field, the 67-year-old ex-first lady has a final opportunity to explain her vision, where she wants to take the country that currently believes nearly two-to-one that America is on the wrong track with Obama.Sunday was not the best day for Hillary Clinton to launch her bid. It was the 16th anniversary of a Federal judge holding hubby Bill in contempt for misleading her about his sexual relationship with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. A reminder of the tawdry scandals, stonewallings and ethical controversies that seem attracted to the Clintons like swarming barnyard insects.And it's not the best position for Hillary Clinton to credibly argue that her lackluster State Department tenure, including the deadly, avoidable Benghazi incident, qualifies her to be commander-in-chief. ""Does America want a third Obama term?” Ted Cruz asked needlessly.Then as always there's history: Since FDR in 1944, U.S. voters have given the same party three consecutive White House terms only once, 1988 when Vice President George H.W. Bush won, in effect, a third Reagan term. But Reagan was popular, 57% approval. Obama not so much (46%).“It’s hard for any party to hang on to the White House for 12 years,” recently noted Hillary's husband, whose two-term legacy was inadequate to boost his own vice president to victory in 2000.In her day-before-the-announcement announcement video Clinton explained: ""Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.” Again with the ""want.""In not the best choice of talking points, reminding Americans of the worst economic recovery since World War II, the ex-Obama cabinet member said: ""Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times"" under Obama.Then, the woman who claimed to be ""dead broke"" with two mansions who's been demanding $300,000 plus a crudite assortment for every speech, added: ""But the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.” Do ya think? And which millionaires would that be?Clinton has a clear path to her party's nomination in Philadelphia 15 months from now. Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb are political nobodies building resumes for speaking fees and possible future runs somewhere. That will save her much of the $1.7 billion money she could raise from ""those at the top."" But it will not hone her clumsy campaign skills.We know that Elizabeth Warren, who's much more in tune ideologically with the party's activist base, is not running. She's said it so many times, many now doubt her sincerity. The Ready for Warren draft crowd, however, was ready for Hillary Sunday. Said Manager Erica Sagrans:""We look forward to Hillary Clinton and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that Senator Warren has spent her life leading -- from taking on Wall Street to ending skyrocketing income inequality so that working families get a fighting chance.""To show how in-touch she is with ""everyday Americans,"" Clinton plans an immediate ""listening tour"" to New Hampshire and Iowa this week, the kind of tour she made in 1993 for her doomed healthcare plan. We'll see if Clinton's staff plants favorable questions among audience members, as it did in Iowa in 2007.Clinton must fake sincerity much better than in the past. After her illegal email deletions and foundation fundraising while in office, polls show a majority now deem her untrustworthy and inauthentic.She's got roughly five months to show her party's big money moguls on the coasts that she's found her voice again. It's the politics of winning. They're totally committed to her until they're not.Like the Bushes, Clinton has a strong national fundraising operation intact. And after the first black president, maybe Americans will buy a proclaimed historical need for the first female president. On Clinton's side, she also has her husband, though he's a simultaneous liability.Another awkward liability Republicans already point out is her close relationship with Obama. And as the email deletion scandal shows, the likelihood of some other ethical eruptions that require misleading explanations and half-truths.Next up today, on the GOP side Marco Rubio reveals his political decision about a 2016 campaign -- for the Senate or White House.RELATED:Can Hillary's hopes survive Benghazi?Has the media finally turned on the Clintons?Hillary's email scandal brings her more 🙁 poll news

1435,MS,"Now the real stress begins. Round 2 results of the Federal Reserve's stress tests for banks are scheduled for release Wednesday, and some big banks that passed last week could find themselves getting the stink eye from regulators this week.
"
1436,MS,"The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) tests the nation's 31 largest banks, including seven foreign-owned lenders, on their plans to return capital to investors via dividend payouts, share buybacks and major acquisitions or sales in the event of a severe recession.
"
1437,MS,"It's regulators' most high-profile method of keeping banks in check after the financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts that ensued.
"
1438,MS,"Overall, Barclays analysts wrote in a research note that they expect payout ratios to increase to 79% this year compared with 65% in last year's CCAR. Dividend payouts should be below historical averages (28% vs. 41%) while share repurchases should be above the historic norms (53% vs. 39%), Barclays analysts said.
"
1439,MS,"""We ... look for most (banks) to continue or increase their share repurchase activity (this year),"" Barclays noted.
"
1440,MS,"Last week, all 31 banks passed the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST), which showed they all met minimum capital ratio requirements in the hypothetical situation that the unemployment rate hits 10%, stocks plunge and the housing market declines 25%.
"
1441,MS,"But passing Round 1 — even with flying colors — does not mean getting through Round 2 is assured. Last year, Citigroup (C) passed the first round, only to stumble when the Fed rejected its investor payout plan, citing its concern with the New York-based bank's ability to foresee losses in ""material parts of its global operations.""
"
1442,MS,"Since that time, Citi has sold off its OneMain Financial unit for personal loans to Springleaf Holdings (LEAF) for $4.25 billion in cash. It also said it will pull its retail banking business out of 11 markets — mostly in Central and South America — as well as leave the consumer banking markets of Japan, Egypt, the Czech Republic and elsewhere.
"
1443,MS,"With CEO Michael Corbat and CFO John Gerspach's jobs reportedly on the line, at least one analyst thinks Citi's senior management will lean on the side of conservatism when it comes to putting forth its capital return plan.
"
1444,MS,"""I think they're going to be fine because they've had a full year to go back and address the things the Fed was concerned with,"" said Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""Getting approved for $7 billion (in investor paybacks) would be good news.""
"
1445,MS,"Bank of America (BAC) passed Round 1, but memories remain of its bungled CCAR submission last year that led the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender to abandon a 5-cent dividend payout. As a result, the Fed could be tougher on it in terms of analyzing its payouts.
"
1446,MS,"""They're one where I'm a little more cautious that a qualitative issue could prove a disappointment,"" Harte said.
"
1447,MS,"Goldman Sachs (GS) underwhelmed at the DFAST level by posting a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.1%, compared to the 8% minimum, but its 6.3% Tier 1 common capital ratio, which gauges high-quality capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, bested the 5% minimum.
"
1448,MS,"After last year's exams, the New York-based bank responded by cutting its total assets by $55 billion from a year earlier to $856 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.
"
1449,MS,"""The total capital is easier to rectify than common equity,"" Harte said. ""We think they'll have a pretty good buyback.""
"
1450,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS) reached a $2.6 billion residential mortgage-backed securities settlement with the Department of Justice last month and the deal wiped out about half a year's worth of earnings. That could result in the Fed demanding more conservative capital plans, Harte noted.
"
1451,MS,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the nation's largest bank, has the highest capital requirements and is expected to pass CCAR. Wells Fargo (WFC) too is expected to get a Round 2 passing grade.
"
1452,MS,"Given all the rigorous testing, perhaps it could be argued that the Fed, which was accused of lax regulation pre-financial crisis, has overlearned the crisis' lessons.

1453,MS,"""Over the next couple of years, we're going to be looking at massively overcapitalized banks under any scenario unless they're allowed to return more capital to shareholders,"" Harte said.Now the real stress begins. Round 2 results of the Federal Reserve's stress tests for banks are scheduled for release Wednesday, and some big banks that passed last week could find themselves getting the stink eye from regulators this week.The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) tests the nation's 31 largest banks, including seven foreign-owned lenders, on their plans to return capital to investors via dividend payouts, share buybacks and major acquisitions or sales in the event of a severe recession.It's regulators' most high-profile method of keeping banks in check after the financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts that ensued.Overall, Barclays analysts wrote in a research note that they expect payout ratios to increase to 79% this year compared with 65% in last year's CCAR. Dividend payouts should be below historical averages (28% vs. 41%) while share repurchases should be above the historic norms (53% vs. 39%), Barclays analysts said.""We ... look for most (banks) to continue or increase their share repurchase activity (this year),"" Barclays noted.Last week, all 31 banks passed the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST), which showed they all met minimum capital ratio requirements in the hypothetical situation that the unemployment rate hits 10%, stocks plunge and the housing market declines 25%.But passing Round 1 — even with flying colors — does not mean getting through Round 2 is assured. Last year, Citigroup (C) passed the first round, only to stumble when the Fed rejected its investor payout plan, citing its concern with the New York-based bank's ability to foresee losses in ""material parts of its global operations.""Since that time, Citi has sold off its OneMain Financial unit for personal loans to Springleaf Holdings (LEAF) for $4.25 billion in cash. It also said it will pull its retail banking business out of 11 markets — mostly in Central and South America — as well as leave the consumer banking markets of Japan, Egypt, the Czech Republic and elsewhere.With CEO Michael Corbat and CFO John Gerspach's jobs reportedly on the line, at least one analyst thinks Citi's senior management will lean on the side of conservatism when it comes to putting forth its capital return plan.""I think they're going to be fine because they've had a full year to go back and address the things the Fed was concerned with,"" said Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""Getting approved for $7 billion (in investor paybacks) would be good news.""Bank of America (BAC) passed Round 1, but memories remain of its bungled CCAR submission last year that led the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender to abandon a 5-cent dividend payout. As a result, the Fed could be tougher on it in terms of analyzing its payouts.""They're one where I'm a little more cautious that a qualitative issue could prove a disappointment,"" Harte said.Goldman Sachs (GS) underwhelmed at the DFAST level by posting a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.1%, compared to the 8% minimum, but its 6.3% Tier 1 common capital ratio, which gauges high-quality capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, bested the 5% minimum.After last year's exams, the New York-based bank responded by cutting its total assets by $55 billion from a year earlier to $856 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.""The total capital is easier to rectify than common equity,"" Harte said. ""We think they'll have a pretty good buyback.""Morgan Stanley (MS) reached a $2.6 billion residential mortgage-backed securities settlement with the Department of Justice last month and the deal wiped out about half a year's worth of earnings. That could result in the Fed demanding more conservative capital plans, Harte noted.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the nation's largest bank, has the highest capital requirements and is expected to pass CCAR. Wells Fargo (WFC) too is expected to get a Round 2 passing grade.Given all the rigorous testing, perhaps it could be argued that the Fed, which was accused of lax regulation pre-financial crisis, has overlearned the crisis' lessons.""Over the next couple of years, we're going to be looking at massively overcapitalized banks under any scenario unless they're allowed to return more capital to shareholders,"" Harte said.

1460,MS,"This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.

1493,MS,"War On Terror: The head of U.S. Southern Command has warned lawmakers that IS is radicalizing converts and other Muslims in Latin America and could train and send them north via human traffickers.Gen. John Kelly issued his warning in a hearing Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee on defense appropriations for fiscal 2016.He's concerned that in addition to the Iranian terrorist puppet Hezbollah being active in Latin America, the Islamic State is promoting and recruiting for jihad against the United States in the region.""Last year, IS adherents posted discussions on social media calling for the infiltration of the U.S. southern border,"" Kelly told lawmakers.He added that while no evidence of IS recruits using this entry route has been seen thus far, he was ""deeply concerned that smuggling networks are a vulnerability that terrorists could seek to exploit.""So why would IS, with so many of its trainees possessing Western passports, seek to use ""coyotes"" to transport their minions into the U.S.? Not every IS trainee has a passport, and tracking those who enter the U.S. to do us harm is less likely if they hide among the flood of ""immigrants"" the Obama administration is openly encouraging.The war in Syria has thus far attracted roughly 100 foreign fighters from the Caribbean who could easily make their way here, Kelly said. A hundred might not seem like a lot until we remember just 19 Muslims brought down the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon, killing 3,000, on Sept. 11, 2001.What makes Kelly's words resonate is confirmation from the FBI that IS is indeed already walking our streets. ""We have active investigations of people in various stages of radicalizing in all 50 states,"" FBI Director James Comey told the National Association of Attorneys General recently.This isn't a New York or Washington phenomenon. This is in all 50 states and in ways that are very hard to see.We already see pockets of potential recruits in places such as ""Little Mogadishu"" in Minneapolis. Fox affiliate KMSP-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul has reported the case of Abdirahmaan Muhumed.Before going to Syria to fight and die for IS, he worked at Delta Global Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. His job was to clean aircraft, and he had a security clearance that gave him unfettered access to the tarmac and passenger jets.Abu-Salha, a 22-year-old Floridian, managed to return home for a time without U.S. authorities noticing, before returning to Syria and carrying out a massive suicide truck bombing. From the grave, he's recruiting other Americans to join the jihad in a widely distributed martyrdom video.""Sunni extremists, while small in number, are actively involved in the radicalization of converts and other Muslims in the region and also provide financial and logistical support to designated terrorist organizations within and outside Latin America,"" Kelly told the panel.Kelly also expressed his concern that the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah continues to exploit and expand its penetration of the region.Kelly noted that Iran has established 80 ""cultural centers"" in the area, ostensibly to promote Iran's image and Shi'a Islam.But as we have found, they can be recruiting centers for radicalized terrorists.Last year, as we noted then, Kelly used the term ""existential threat"" to describe the influx of people from countries that harbor terrorists, as well as violent transnational gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, which specializes in extortion and human trafficking and has criminal franchises throughout the U.S.We concur. They're coming to kill us, and some are already here or on their way via our porous southern border.
"
1494,MS,"It turns out that Hillary Clinton's Tweet last week on her still-downloading private email scandal was insufficient to quiet the PR sandstorm in Washington.So, Team Hillary has ""announced"" by old-fashioned leak to sympathetic reporters that at some point soon, possible even today, she will address the smoldering fire that threatens her coronation as president. This should be good, watching this rusty politician try to talk her way out of a clear violation of her own department's strict regulations.She bumbled her way through last year's book tour. The books didn't sell as well as expected. But what does Clinton care? She got her huge advance up front. Actual sales only determine if she gets even more money. No give-backs, especially if you're a Clinton dealing with money. That's why the couple never really was ""dead-broke.""But last summer's book-signings and all of her high-priced speaking engagements did not include a feeding frenzy of cloistered news media hungry for a new story to replace Barack Obama's ongoing bumble-fest. So, she'll probably duck the Washington media and try her excuse-a-thon in New York City.You would think after 25 years of public controversies, scandals, lies and denials that these two Clintons and their minions would learn the first lesson of politics: When you have bad news, get it out immediately -- all of it.Embarrassing dribs and drabs emerging every day -- she had her own private email server, her aides had off-line email accounts too, there are no released emails for times when she was photographed clearly sending emails -- are like those medical drips in the hospital if they were poison.Here's why the Clintons don't follow that rule: They're entitled. So, they get away with not.Think about all those Clinton scandals in the nineties -- Travelgate, Cattlegate, Hillarycare, BedroomGate and, of course, ""that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.""OK, don't think about all of them. They were mind-numbing. But there were a lot. That pair just denies any wrongdoing. And they and their minions talk each one to death until everyone is tired of trying to follow the complications they've thrown up. And then Hill and Bill declare it's old news.That's what Obama is trying to do with the IRS and Benghazi scandals. It worked on Fast & Furious, Solyndra and others.Stall to make the details old. Then, point out they're old. Do you remember Hillary denouncing the Bush White House for secret emails? Probably not. Blatant hypocrisy. But it works in that swamp.Bill tried that this weekend. He said hey, our foundation got money from foreign nations. You bet. We have before too. We believe in transparency. Just put it all out there and let everyone make up their minds. Uh-huh.The entire point of having your own email server is to control what gets out and what gets ""lost."" That's the opposite of transparency.But Hillary will likely try that this week: I released 55,000 emails. What more do you want?Well, for starters ALL four years of her emails. There could be 400,000 for all we know. Or two million. She controls every single one because Obama's crowd let her get away with it.The White House revealed Monday that Obama did exchange emails with Hillary but -- wait for it -- he didn't know it was illegal until he saw news reports. What's a poor president to do? Obama has transcripts of Angela Merkel's cellphone calls with hubby, but he just didn't notice the header on his secretary of State's emails. For four years.What's so dangerous for Hillary's unannounced candidacy is all the stalling, the prevarications and equivocations remind so many voters of why we were tired of them and so glad when the moving vans took their stuff to one of their mansions.And let's be honest: If Hillary's forced to drop out of a contest she hasn't entered, who's left for Democrats in 2016? Seriously. Martin O'Malley? Didn't he own the Dodgers? Or Chief Elizabeth Warren?Despite being a used car, Hillary remains very popular in polls -- among Democrats. The new Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll finds that 44% of all voters and 73% of Democrats believe the 67-year-old Hillary Clinton will bring fresh, new ideas to the country. Didn't say it made sense, just that those are the poll numbers.But here's a real IED for the nascent Clinton campaign. She's become a negative meme in pop culture: Her artificial, calculated personality is now the subject of an opening skit for 'Saturday Night Live.' The people who remember her will nod and laugh. Those who don't will learn.

1496,MS,"Scandal: The email plot thickens with news that Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff also used a private email account on the Clintons' server to conduct government business.Watchdog group Judicial Watch, which doesn't like being lied to or jerked around any more than the House Benghazi Select Committee does, has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of State seeking all communications, including emails, between Secretary of State Clinton and Huma Abedin with Nagla Mahmoud, wife of ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi between Jan. 21, 2009, and Jan. 21, 2013.The lawsuit — which also seeks a thorough search of Clinton's newly discovered private email accounts connected to a home-based server to exclusively conduct government business — comes alongside the issue of subpoenas by the Benghazi Select Committee. Both have long been curious about the scarcity of produced emails with Clinton's name on them.Abedin, perhaps best remembered as the wife of disgraced former congressman Anthony Wiener, is a longtime Hillary friend and confidante. She served as Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the same time she worked as a consultant to the Clinton Foundation and a New York advisory firm tied to the Clintons, one that did business before the government.Foreign contributions to the Clinton Foundation — including from governments and sources which might not have our best interests at heart, during and after Clinton's tenure as secretary of state — are raising questions about conflicts of interest and possible quid pro quos.Abedin made $135,000 a year as Clinton's deputy, a period in which she is reported to have raked in as much as $355,000 from consulting contracts. Having a pipeline into the Clinton inner circle is invaluable to some. This reminds us of Johnny Chung's famous comparison of the Clinton White House to a subway turn style — you had to put money in to gain entry.Abedin also has some interesting family connections. Her father is said to be close with the Saudi government's Muslim World League, and her mother is said to be a member of the Muslim Sisterhood. World Trade Center bombing prosecutor Andrew McCarthy wrote in National Review: ""The ties of Ms. Abedin's father, mother and brother to the Muslim Brotherhood are both specific and substantiated.""The Muslim Brotherhood took power in Egypt with the Obama administration's approval after it had all but abandoned the government of Hosni Mubarak, a long-time ally and friend. It was while Abedin was advising Hillary that State dropped its long-standing policy of having no dealings with the Muslim Brotherhood.The Benghazi terrorist attack also happened on the Obama-Clinton watch. It would be interesting to see what Benghazi-related emails went through Clinton's private server. Were there some discussing the Benghazi video lie or planning Clinton's political cover?According to Gawker.com, among several email addresses linked to Abedin's name in records maintained by Lexis-Nexis is one for [email protected] Emails sent by Gawker to that to that email address went through without error.In the hidden emails might be information pertaining to just who benefited both politically and financially from their relationship with Clinton and Abedin, whose relationship seems to mirror the one between Obama aide Valerie Jarrett and the president.So who benefited, and how, from their connections with the two?What is the relationship between donors to the Clinton Foundation and U.S. foreign policy?And why won't Abedin disclose the complete list of her consulting contracts when she worked for Clinton?Slick Willie, move over. Slick Hillary is taking your place in history.

1498,MS,"Economic Systems: The alarmists keep telling us their concern about global warming is all about man's stewardship of the environment. But we know that's not true. A United Nations official has now confirmed this.At a news conference last week in Brussels, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.'s Framework Convention on Climate Change, admitted that the goal of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity but to destroy capitalism.""This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution,"" she said.Referring to a new international treaty environmentalists hope will be adopted at the Paris climate change conference later this year, she added: ""This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.""The only economic model in the last 150 years that has ever worked at all is capitalism. The evidence is prima facie: From a feudal order that lasted a thousand years, produced zero growth and kept workdays long and lifespans short, the countries that have embraced free-market capitalism have enjoyed a system in which output has increased 70-fold, work days have been halved and lifespans doubled.Figueres is perhaps the perfect person for the job of transforming ""the economic development model"" because she's really never seen it work. ""If you look at Ms. Figueres' Wikipedia page,"" notes Cato economist Dan Mitchell: Making the world look at their right hand while they choke developed economies with their left.

1500,MS,"Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), the big banks that suffered during the financial crisis, have cast a gradual, upward trajectory over the past year. Yet as they prepare to report Q4 results in the coming days, their recent quarterly gains have come largely from opposing sources: Morgan Stanley's from stability, Goldman Sachs' from volatility.
"
1501,MS,"Despite strong performances the previous quarter, analysts seem to be keeping their expectations in check.
"
1502,MS,"Analysts expect Goldman Sachs, which reports Friday, to earn $4.32 a share during the quarter, down 6% from the period last year. Revenue is expected to fall 13% from the year-ago period to $7.635 billion.
"
1503,MS,"Those results would follow a third quarter in which the investment bank scorched past analysts' expectations for EPS growth and solidly beat revenue forecasts. Those gains — EPS up 59% to $4.57, revenue up 25% to $8.4 billion — were led by strong fixed-income trading resulting from a more volatile environment.
"
1504,MS,"Shares sold off the day the company reported results on concerns that earnings were juiced by constrained compensation. Analysts have also worried whether Goldman Sachs' most-depended-upon growth driver — its fixed-income, commodities and currencies trading — was also the likeliest to suffer from U.S. capital requirements and other regulations.
"
1505,MS,"Zacks last month said those regulations ""are expected to weigh on its financials in the coming quarters,"" but added that the firm could gain ""from its well-managed global franchise"" and solid capital.
"
1506,MS,"Barclays in a research note on Tuesday said a reduced compensation ratio could offset lower revenues. As mergers and acquisitions accelerate, Goldman Sachs also stands to rake in enough in fees to offset struggles in equity and debt underwriting, Barclays added. Analysts there also see a continuation in share buybacks, which boost EPS.

"
1510,MS,"While Goldman Sachs is still holding out for a rebound in fixed-income, rival Morgan Stanley has moved away from such trades to focus more on its wealth-management business, an effort that has proved to be less risky but still profitable.
"
1511,MS,"In Q3, Morgan Stanley's EPS jumped 30% to 65 cents and revenue rose 7.3% to $8.7 billion, beating expectations, boosted by wealth management.
"
1512,MS,"When Morgan Stanley reports Q4 results Jan. 20, analysts expect EPS to fall by 2 cents year over year to 48 cents. Revenue is forecast to fall slightly to $8.077 billion.
"
1513,MS,"JMP on Monday downgraded Morgan Stanley to market perform. Barclays in a research note Tuesday also cited concerns about ""a more challenging trading outlook"" and lower credit and commodities revenue, but expected wealth management to remain strong. Like Goldman Sachs, Barclays said M&A fees could make up for struggles in equity.

1620,MS,"Homeland Security: To keep out Islamic State terrorists, the Saudis are building a 600-mile-long barrier — complete with five layers of fencing, underground movement censors and radar cameras — on their northern border. If they can do it ...Good fences, it is said, make for good neighbors, which on a grand scale was the intent of the Great Wall of China in antiquity and the Israeli fences of more recent vintage. Both were designed to keep out intruders and to make sure all guests were invited guests. Unlike the Berlin Wall, they were built to keep hostiles out, not citizens in.As the threat of IS terrorism grew in Iraq and Syria, Saudi Arabia decided it might be a good idea to put such a barrier between its citizens and those who might want to kill them. Last September, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud initiated construction of a multilayered barrier that eventually will stretch along the entire Iraqi border from Kuwait to Jordan.Earlier this month, Saudi prudence seemed vindicated by a suicide bombing and gun attack that killed two Saudi border guards and their commanding officer right next to Iraq's Anbar province. Saudi oil fields might make a tempting IS target. The group has also said its eventual goal is to take over the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina.""It is the first attack by Islamic State itself against Saudi Arabia and is a clear message after Saudi Arabia entered the international coalition against it,"" Mustafa Alani, an Irawi security analyst with close ties to Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, told Reuters. The Saudis sent 30,000 troops to the border last July after IS forces swept into western Iraq and Iraqi border guards fled.According to Jane's Defense Weekly, the barrier will be six miles deep with 79 watch towers. Monitoring will include thermal imagers and battlefield radar systems capable of detecting individuals at a distance of 12 miles and vehicles at up to 24 miles. The barrier will be patrolled by border guards and 240 rapid-response vehicles.Contrast the Saudi fence and border security efforts with our porous border, which recently allowed tens of thousands of ""unaccompanied minors"" to stream across and routinely allows drug cartels and their ""coyotes"" to smuggle anyone across for any purpose into the United States.Activist filmmaker James O'Keefe recently made a six-minute video showing how he was able to cross the Rio Grande from Mexico into west Texas wearing a Halloween-esque Osama bin Laden costume with nary a Border Patrol officer in sight and no fence to worry about.Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, recently testified before Congress that our southern border constituted a threat as ""existential"" as any foreign power, with gangs like MS-13 and terrorist group members hiding among the tidal wave of illegals. Among the ""undocumented"" are significant numbers of OTMs (other than Mexicans), including those from countries considered incubators or outright state sponsors of terror.""Clearly, criminal networks can move just about anything on these smuggling pipelines,"" Kelly said last February to the House Armed Services Committee. ""Terrorist organizations could seek to leverage those same smuggling routes to move operatives with intent to cause grave harm to our citizens or even quite easily bring weapons of mass destruction into the United States.""If President Obama, instead of letting that happen, and even encouraging it with free goodies, built a fence like the Saudis, he could probably get what he calls ""immigration reform"" passed by a unanimous vote in both houses of Congress tomorrow.

Revenue fell 2.3% to $21.4 billion, missing views of $21.2 billion.No stranger to the courts, JPMorgan has been targeted by government regulators and plaintiffs' lawyers alike. In Q4, it posted a $1.1 billion charge before taxes for legal expenses. It was one of several big banks that paid a total of $4.3 billion to regulators in the U.S., Switzerland and the United Kingdom for allegedly rigging foreign exchange currency markets.Provisions for credit losses — money set aside to cover bad loans — swelled to $804 million from $104 million in Q4 2013.The bank's total assets rose 7% for the year to $2.6 trillion at Dec. 31.Of those assets, total loans grew 3% to $757.3 billion. Credit card loans rose 3% to $131 billion. Core loans rose 8% year over year, while the bank's net interest margin slipped five basis points to 2.14%. Net income for consumer and community banking fell 11% to $2.2 billion.Fixed-income markets revenue dropped 23% from the prior year to $2.5 billion, driven by JPMorgan's sale of its commodities unit as well as lower revenue in its securitized product and credit-related products.Return on equity dropped to 9% in Q4 from 10% in Q4 2013, while return on assets slid to 0.78% from 0.87% a year earlier.Shares fell 4.4% in morning tradng and remained depressed by early afternoon at about 56.15 in the stock market today (Wednesday). JPMorgan, whose stock gained 7% last year, has seen its shares drop 10% this year and fall below the company's 200-day moving average. JPMorgan currently has an IBD Composite Rating of 44, which means that 56% of other publicly traded companies' stock outperform it.Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported Q4 earnings today, largely meeting Wall Street expectations.

The deal was expected to close during the second half of this year.But the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. — an interagency panel that reviews transactions the could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person or company — never gave its approval.Morgan Stanley said that it will continue in its efforts to sell its oil unit. The bank, along with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), has come under scrutiny and criticism from federal lawmakers over commodities operations.Earlier this year, a Senate panel issued a report criticizing Morgan Stanley and other big banks, stating that they had an undue influence on commodities prices and could threaten the economy should one of their commodities units collapse.Morgan Stanley shares fell nearly 1% to 38.14 on the stock market today.

1642,MS,"Election 2016: The State Department is dragging its feet with unusual delays in releasing records pertaining to presidential contender Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. Some requests are up to four years old.It's not as if the Associated Press and others that filed the Freedom of Information Act requests were asking for Clinton's private diaries or the encryption codes used by the State Department. Among the requests are such seemingly innocuous things as schedules, appointment, travel records, where and when she traveled, and who she traveled and met with.There are items, however, that a 2016 presidential candidate might prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind for as long as possible. We're thinking about details on the Benghazi terrorist attack and subsequent cover-up of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four Americans, including the first U.S. ambassador killed on duty in three decades.The AP requests also include documents pertaining to her department's decision to appoint her longtime aide Huma Abedin to a position seemingly created just for her, the State Department's role in the Osama bin Laden raid, and Clinton's role in overseeing a major defense contractor. At least one of the requests dates back to March 2010.Abedin might be better known in public as the wife of disgraced former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner. As we've reported, Abedin served as Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the same time she worked as a consultant to the Clinton Foundation and a New York advisory firm tied to the Clintons, one that did business before the government.Abedin also has some interesting family connections. Her father is said to be close with the Saudi government's Muslim World League and her mother is said to be a member of the Muslim Sisterhood. World Trade Center bombing prosecutor Andrew McCarthy wrote in National Review:""The ties of Ms. Abedin's father, mother and brother to the Muslim Brotherhood are both specific and substantiated.""Of course, Clinton might ask what difference does it make now that a close, hand-picked adviser had conflicts of interest on many levels and might not have had the best interests of the U.S. at heart in dispensing her advice.As the AP notes, the State Department has on average taken 450 days to respond to FOIA requests. But in answering FOIA requests regarding Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, it repeatedly has gone beyond that. That average is seven times longer than even Eric Holder's Justice Department takes, and some 30 times longer than the Treasury Department.The question is: Why? This wouldn't be the first time the State Department has acted politically. We have suggested the Benghazi cover-up and video lie pushed by Clinton, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice and even President Obama for weeks after the Benghazi attack was an attempt to protect Obama's re-election campaign and Hillary's possible 2016 bid. The truth would have shattered the narrative that al-Qaida had been defeated and the war on terror won.We have noted that the language in an email from Obama aide Ben Rhodes used to prep Rice for her whirlwind five Sunday talk show appearances is virtually identical to that issued by the former secretary of state 36 hours before Rice's appearances — the first public official to mention the video. The whole video story was a politically motivated lie in which Clinton and her State Department were complicit.So we are not surprised that the State Department that Clinton served would delay release of documents and records that might lead to uncomfortable questions to and about her. She has written a book entitled ""Hard Choices."" We suggest she make one and publicly request the stalled FOIA requests be honored expeditiously.

1643,MS,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. In her op-ed, ""Hospitals Manipulate Drug Program For Poor"" (Issues & Insights, Nov. 12), Sally Pipes once again is generous with the former and light on the latter concerning the 340B drug discount program.From her frequent attacks, it's hard to determine if there's a personal vendetta or if Ms. Pipes is merely a mouthpiece for the pharmaceutical industry.We can thank Big Pharma — not the 340B program — for skyrocketing drug costs. Sovaldi for hepatitis C at $1,000 per pill is threatening to bankrupt state Medicaid programs. Generics have seen gravity-defying increases of 2,800% and more, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. The situation is so alarming that Congress has held hearings to investigate and legislation has been introduced to curb prices.Amid this stratospheric-pricing frenzy, the drug industry has the audacity to point the finger at safety-net hospitals for rising health care costs. Really? These providers treat the poorest Americans, often for free. Many are based in rural areas and struggle to stay open.The fact is, Congress created 340B with bipartisan support in 1992 to help hospitals serving high numbers of economically vulnerable people. Under the program, eligible providers receive pharmaceuticals at discounted prices from drug companies. These safety-net hospitals pass the discounts on to needy patients and also sell the medications to insured individuals at negotiated rates. They then use the funds generated to provide vital clinical and specialized services, again for people who cannot afford to pay for care.The world's top drug companies enjoy staggering profit margins in excess of 20% per year, according to Fortune. That's another fact. Yet the author somehow pleads poverty for the industry when it comes to discounts provided under the tiny 340B program.Because pharmaceutical companies provide zero transparency in medicine costs and pricing, we will never know how much profit they actually forego. Even if Pipes' theoretical $6 billion ""loss"" is correct, the fact is that it's less than a quarter of the $27 billion the industry spends on sales and marketing in the U.S. each year!The most compelling fact? The 340B program represents just 2% of the $329 billion annual U.S. pharmaceutical market. That's $7 billion in purchases in a $3 trillion U.S. health care market. Can a tail that small really wag the dog that big when it comes to rising drug prices or the cost of health care?The author's assertion concerning Walgreens profits is not sourced and sounds a lot like a simple repetition of Big Pharma misinformation. The fact is that only one half of 1% of Walgreens retail scripts were written under 340B, according to a recent study in Health Affairs. It also shows vulnerable populations such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis patients are being well served thanks to the program.Let me put another fact on the table. To qualify for 340B discounts, all safety-net hospitals must certify annually with the government that they serve high numbers of Medicaid patients and low-income seniors. On average, 42% of these patients are poor or disabled.Add to that the tens of millions of uninsured or underinsured patients who cannot pay for services and you get a clearer picture of the situation. These providers shoulder $24.6 billion in uncompensated care costs each year — almost twice as much as non-340B hospitals.It's important to understand that the 340B drug discount program is not funded by taxpayers. In truth, it is funded at the expense of even greater profits by the pharmaceutical industry. These multi-billion-dollar companies are working hard in Washington to discredit and dismantle the program to boost their bottom lines even more.That is deplorable. Gutknecht is a former Republican congressman from Minnesota. He consults with a number of companies and organizations, including Safety Net Hospitals for Pharmaceutical Access, a nonprofit association of providers participating in the 340B program.

1713,MS,"You'd think a leading stock should be able to hold up even if others in its industry group are flailing.But just as a stock can get a lift from big moves by others in its industry group, they can also undergo a sympathy move when peers are sinking. So keep an eye on what is going on within the group as well.""Grouping and tracking stocks by industry group can also help get you out of weakening investments faster,"" IBD founder and chairman Bill O'Neil said in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""If, after a successful run, one or two important stocks in a group breaks seriously, the weakness may sooner or later 'wash over' into the remaining stocks in that field.""Add this fact to your arsenal of sell rules. Rarely will a stock keep advancing if most of its peers aren't.Nearly half of a great stock's move is predicated on its industry group and sector's strength. Yet there can be a variety of reasons for a group's move south, including sector rotation within the market, industry-related news and a general correction.Take the financials in 2007 and '08, when the subprime mortgage crisis and the U.S. economic recession came to a head. Once the big investment banks began to crack in late 2007, the weakness spread to the rest of the sector. By the time the slump ended, only a few major U.S. investment banks were left standing, including Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Both turned into commercial banks, which are subject to stricter regulation. Lehman Bros. went bankrupt. Bear Stearns was sold to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Bank of America (BAC) scooped up Merrill Lynch.Another group, the private educators, benefited from the overall economic weakness and collapse in the financial sector as people returned to school to pursue a new career path or upgrade their skills.Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) even came public in November 2008, at 12 a share. It rose as much as 137% by mid-April 2010. But the good times didn't last long.That month, the for-profit school group got hit after an Education Department official said more regulation was needed in the industry. It wasn't the first time the group had been scrutinized.Career Education (CECO) went on a massive run from its 1998 debut to its April 2004 peak. But the stock headed south between 2004 and 2006 as the company faced probes and lawsuits alleging it misrepresented its programs to consumers. It spent the next few years turning itself around with new management and other changes.The stock advanced from 2008 to 2010. But peers including Apollo Education Group (APOL) and Corinthian Colleges (COCO) had already begun to slide in early 2009.Career Education hung in there, even breaking out from a base in March 2010 and rising 24% over the next month and a half (1) . But the peer pressure began to take its toll. After failing to break out from a series of bases (2) in August 2011, the stock finally caved in and entered a steep descent.Career Education crashed through its 10-week moving average, a key sell signal, then spiraled down to its April 2013 bottom of 2.03. Today the stock is still trading in the mid-single digits. Even Grand Canyon, which remains one of the sector's better players, slid from April 2010 to May 2011.

The stock opened the year at 31.With Germany on the verge of recession, China and Japan's economies slowing and major stock indexes giving investors whiplash, the third-quarter performance of big banks could offer some charm to soothe the savage beast for investors.Tuesday brings a trifecta of big banks reporting, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which three more reporting later in the week.Accelerating loan growth — especially for consumer loans — and any changes in loan loss reserves and regulatory capital levels will be watched. So will changes in capital markets activity in investment banking and the always-important expenses.""If we do see strong consumer loan growth out of the guys reporting on Tuesday, that can be a pretty good backdrop for the larger banks and the economy,"" said Frederick Cannon, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Meanwhile, recent stock market volatility — as evidenced by the daily 1.5% to 2% up and down gyrations last week — has helped ""make people believe (volatility) is a cyclical issue rather than a secular issue,"" said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.The nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase is expected to earn $1.38 per share, way up from Q3 '13, when the bank booked a 17-cent EPS loss thanks in part to a $13 billion settlement to end a Justice Department mortgage query.

Analysts expect the New York-based Citigroup on Tuesday to report a 12% rise to $1.12 and its revenue to gain 4.5% to $19.04 billion.""We're looking for positive trends but not spectacular changes in the expense side of the equation,"" said Sandler O'Neill's Jeffrey Harte.Citigroup shares traded down 2% at 50.11. It started the year at 52.Bank of America (BAC) reports on Thursday. The last of the big settlements with government regulators came with Bank of America's $16.65 billion deal in August, over the sale of mortgage-backed securities — partly by itself but mostly by Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch before BofA bought them during the recession of 2007-09.Thanks to that settlement, the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender is forecast to post a 9-cent EPS loss.

1738,MS,"Big U.S. banks can expect tougher capital requirements than their foreign counterparts will face, as regulators seek to reduce the risk of a bank failure bringing down the economy, a Federal Reserve official said Tuesday.The surcharge that large American lenders will pay exceeds the requirement of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo told the Senate Banking Committee. Basel is an international forum that seeks to improve global banking guidelines.""We believe that more needs to be done to guard against short-term wholesale funding risks,"" Tarullo said. ""While the total amount of short-term wholesale funding is lower today than immediately before the crisis, volumes are still large relative to the size of the financial system.""The requirement — labeled a capital surcharge — was agreed to by global regulators in 2011 and requires giant banks to boost their high-quality capital by a margin of 1 to 2.5 percentage points, as calculated by the bank's relative riskiness. Twenty-nine banks — eight of them based in America — are required to meet the requirement. The U.S. rules, though not spelled out, promise to be even tougher than the Basel standards.In global regulators' November 2013 list of banks set to face capital surcharges due to their systemic importance, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC) were at the top.It's the latest hurdle put in place for big banks, which are facing the challenge of finding new avenues for growth in light of the increasingly watchful eye of government regulators, liquidity requirements and gargantuan legal settlements stemming from banks' role in the housing meltdown.JPMorgan shares fell 1.3% in the stock market today.

1761,MS,"Mideast: Iraqi Christian and Yazidi representatives are urging the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to call for a special HRC session on the plight of their communities at the hand of jihadists.After the U.S. airstrikes and airdrops to relieve the Islamic State's siege of Mt. Sinjar in Iraq, where the Kurdish-speaking sect known as the Yazidis had fled, President Obama noted on Aug. 14: ""The bottom line is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts.""But shortly before the president spoke, according to ABC News, a spokesman for a U.N. relief agency said the situation on Mount Sinjar remained ""dire"" despite our efforts. Kieran Dwyer, communications chief for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, warned, ""The situation on the mountain is not over.""The situation facing Iraqi Christians and the Yazidis, followers of a sect partly influenced by Christianity but borrowing from other religions as well, is certainly not over. Nor is the plight of non-Muslims throughout the Middle East.Not long after the president spoke, Fox News reported that Islamic State forces slaughtered 80 Yazidis in a northern village.""(Militants) arrived in vehicles, and they started their killing this afternoon,"" Fox News says senior Kurdish official Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters. ""We believe it is because of their (Islamic State's) creed: convert or be killed,"" he added.Breen Tahseen, an Iraqi diplomat whose father, Prince Tahseen Saeed Bek, is the leader of the Yazidi minority, has made a plea to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, to hold a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC) on the plight of the Yazidis and Iraqi Christians. He says Islamist militants have killed at least 3,000 Yazidi men and kidnapped some 5,000.""On behalf of Prince Tahseen and the Yazidi people, we appeal to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay to lead the call for the U.N. Human Rights Council to hold an emergency session in order to focus world attention on the desperate plight of the Yazidi people,"" read the Aug. 20 statement by Tahseen, as reported by the monitoring group U.N. Watch.Iraqi Christian and Yazidi representatives gathered at the HRC headquarters in Geneva to hold a meeting on the plight of Iraq's besieged minorities.In a letter to Pillay, a coalition of human rights groups and parliamentarians from countries such as Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and Estonia also pleaded for such a special session as the one held on Darfur in 2006.""It is unconscionable for the world's highest human rights body — which is pledged, under UNGA Resolution 60/251 (the U.N. resolution that created the HRC) to prevent human rights violations and respond promptly to human rights emergencies — to continue turning a blind eye to the massacre, abuse and intimidation of Iraqi civilians,"" the group wrote in the letter.Whether it be Coptic churches in Egypt, Christian schools in Nigeria or Yazidis in Iraq, non-Muslims are in the cross hairs of Islamists worldwide. The percentage of Christians in the Middle East has been cut in half, down from 10% in 1900 to just 5% as of 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.British Prime Minister David Cameron, bucking the winds of political correctness and a rising Muslim population, noted during his annual Easter reception at 10 Downing Street that Christianity is now ""the most persecuted religion around the world.""""We should stand up against persecution of Christians and other religious groups wherever and wherever we can, and should be unashamed in doing so.""Perhaps our U.N. ambassador, Samantha Power, can give Ms. Pillay a nudge.

1800,MS,"Scandal: A congressional panel has released new emails from top IRS official Lois Lerner, revealing a boiling hatred for the conservatives she illegally targeted. So much for claims that she was just a disinterested bureaucrat.The latest batch of emails released Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee contained more than a ""smidgeon"" of hatred and intolerance from the IRS chief of tax-exempt organizations already famous for singling out conservative Tea Party groups for enforcement scrutiny.""Great,"" Lerner wrote to an IRS colleague who complained about conservative radio at work. ""Maybe we are through if there are that many assholes.""After that, sounding more like a far-left ranter, Lerner likened Republicans to ""teRrorists"" (sic), while her colleague railed about ""the whacko wing of the GOP.""The House committee said that the IRS tried to redact these comments but failed. But it's what you'd expect to find, given the IRS' effort to obstruct Congress by destroying the hard drives of officials under inquiry.""This email shows that Ms. Lerner's mistreatment of conservative groups was driven by her personal hostility toward conservatives,"" wrote Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp to Attorney General Eric Holder.It also gives the lie to early administration claims that the IRS' targeting of political dissidents was nothing but bumbling bureaucrats in Cincinnati, and later, merely the ""management problems"" of a large agency.President Obama finally dismissed the issue as a brouhaha with ""not a smidgeon of corruption."" The hard drives of the bureaucrats were mysteriously destroyed.In fact these emails, small and trivial as they are in chattering content, are indicative of the politicization of government under the Obama administration, the morphing of supposedly impartial executive-branch agencies with all their powers into the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party and its agenda.Nasty in content, they effectively end the long-standing credibility of government agencies as institutions of probity run by impartial civil servants, in place since the 1883 civil service reforms that ended the spoils system.""Lois Lerner's exposed emails show the world she was and is a political hack driven by her own partisan agenda rather than a neutral public servant,"" said Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist.In light of these emails, it's impossible that any taxpayer can trust our government's claims that it's merely impartially enforcing the law. Not only is it not enforcing the law, it's also breaking it.

1801,MS,"Google gets most of the media attention for self-driving cars, but Mobileye's in the driver's seat.A developer of autonomous auto technology, Mobileye said cars with hands-free driving ability could arrive by 2016.Mobileye this week is hitting the road with a hotly anticipated initial public offering. The company, launched 15 years ago in Israel, says it's the leading developer of camera-based driver assistance systems, including automatic braking and collision avoidance.Its technology is in 3.3 million vehicles, including models from BMW, Nissan, General Motors (GM), Honda, Volvo and Ford (F). Mobileye says its technology will be in 160 car models, from 18 makers, by year's end and in 237 car models, from 20 manufacturers, in 2016.It names Tesla (TSLA) as a customer, though no announcement has been made about it using the technology. Google (GOOGL), which is developing driverless car technology, is not listed by Mobileye as a customer.Mobileye plans to raise $610.5 million by selling 27.75 million shares at an expected price of 21 to 23 a share, raised from 17-19, signaling strong demand. It will have a market value near $5.2 billion, says Renaissance Capital.It will list on the NYSE under the symbol MBLY. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are the lead underwriters.It plans to start trading Friday.""Our technology keeps passengers safer on the roads, reduces the risks of traffic accidents, saves lives and has the potential to revolutionize the driving experience by enabling autonomous driving,"" co-founder and CEO Ziv Aviram said in a video presentation for Mobileye's IPO.Mobileye reported revenue of $81.2 million in 2013, up 102%, and net income of $19.9 million.""Mobileye has a near monopoly position,"" said Francis Gaskins, research manager at Equities.com and principal of IPOdesktop.com. ""Revenue and gross profit were up more than 200% in Q1 (from Q1 2013) and that mesmerizes the institutional investors.""The EyeQ Has ItMobileye also develops its own chip technology, called EyeQ.The camera-based system identifies detailed interpretations of roads and sidewalks to help prevent collisions with vehicles, pedestrians and anything else, the company says. It detects roadway markings and boundaries and can read traffic signs and lights.With about 100 million new cars made each year, Mobileye sees a market for assisted driving technology of about $4.5 billion annually. Add in autonomous driving capability, and the market opportunity rises to $15 billion a year, it says.About 78% of its 2013 revenue came from the sale of Mobileye products to original equipment manufacturers, called Tier 1 companies, that are direct suppliers to automakers. They include Magna International (MGA), TRW Automotive Holdings, Delphi Automotive (DLPH), Gentex (GNTX), Kansei and Bendix.Mobileye also gets revenue from sales of aftermarket products in vehicles that do not come pre-equipped with such technology.Trends that will fuel growth include government regulators who are mandating or encouraging the addition of active safety technology in new cars, Aviram said in his video. This includes giving cars rearview cameras, auto-braking abilities, and lane departure and collision warnings.""Active safety technology is going to be in every new car in just a few years,"" Aviram said. ""This will lead to our automated driving car, which will completely revolutionize the way people drive.""Carmakers are starting to use automated driving technology as a sales tool. During the Super Bowl of this past February, for example, Hyundai showed a commercial about its new Genesis car equipped with auto-braking technology, supplied by Mobileye.Aviram says two automakers have signed agreements, with six more in predevelopment discussion, to introduce self-driving vehicles for use on highways.""Eventually, self-driving vehicles will be ubiquitous,"" said John Day, a journalist at Automotive Electronics. ""It will happen little by little, with things like blind-spot detection and cars that park themselves. As consumers get used to the idea, autonomous vehicles will be less scary.""

Management and analysts had expected the European launch to be slow because Novartis (NVS) had gotten into the market first with its MS pill Gilenya. However, on the conference call to discuss results, executives said the uptake in the European countries where it has gained reimbursement (mainly Germany at this point) is proceeding at a similar pace to the U.S.Total sales of Tecfidera outside the U.S. in the quarter were $115 million vs. consensus of $75 million. Domestic sales also outperformed, with a take of $585 million topping estimates by $100 million.Q2 also benefited from a one-time event. During the quarter, Biogen came to an agreement with the Italian National Medicines Agency that eliminated that country's reimbursement limit on Tysabri, an older MS drug, retroactive to February 2013. The recognition of this revenue added 15 cents to Q2 EPS.Amid all the good news, two items disappointed analysts. One was that sales, general and administrative spending was guided higher than expected, at 22%-23% of revenue. On the call, CFO Paul Clancy said this was necessary because of the unprecedented amount of drug launching underway. Not only is Tecfidera still rolling out, but also in Q2 Biogen launched its long-acting hemophilia drug Alprolix (which also beat expectations, with $10 million in sales vs. analysts' $4 million estimate) and just last week launched its hemophilia A counterpart Eloctate. The company is also preparing to launch a new interferon-based MS drug, Plegridy. On the call, Biogen CEO George Scangos said he'd just gotten word that Plegridy has been approved in the EU.The other disappointment was a delay in reporting results from a key clinical trial. For months, the Street has been buzzing about a Biogen pipeline product called anti-LINGO, which could be the first disease-altering treatment for MS. Analysts had expected 12-month results from a phase two trial to be out next year, but management said it will wait until 2016 to report 18-month results.Nonetheless, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum was generally impressed, pointing out that this was the largest beat that Biogen had reported in 10 years.""Overall a really good call with no new disclosures that diluted the quality of the EPS/sales beat on the quarter,"" he wrote in an email to clients after the conference call.Biogen kicks off earnings for several top-rated biotechs. After Tuesday's market close, Gilead Sciences (GILD) is expected to report a 258% earnings per share on sales of its blockbuster Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) are on tap for Thursday.In other biotech news, Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) shot up 287% to 228.10 after the company reported surprisingly strong Phase 3 trial results for its breast cancer drug.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biogen Shares Rebound As Street Has A Change Of Heart.

1824,MS,"Immigration: Texas Gov. Rick Perry correctly warns that illegal immigrants are responsible for 3,000 murders and 8,000 sexual assaults in the past five years. And with the new border surge, there's more trouble on the way.The Obama administration and its media enablers would have you believe the wave of illegal immigrants flooding the border is composed of nothing more than toddlers and their moms fleeing crime in Central America.As House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi put it, they're ""baby Jesus."" But Baby Jesuses don't go around raping and murdering, let alone overcrowding prisons, as Perry bluntly points out.Criminals do, however, and unscreened immigrants who can't or won't comply with the legal process for immigration can be found among the economic migrants who have collaborated with the very gangs they say they are running from to gain entry into the U.S.The FBI's National Gang Intelligence Center reports that Central American illegal immigrant gangs such as the Mara Salvatrucha-13 are responsible for most violent crimes in the U.S. and are the top distributors of illegal drugs.That's perfectly consistent with the 3,000 murders and 8,000 sexual assaults Perry cites for Texas, and there's little doubt it's been made worse by the administration's release of 36,000 deportable felons into U.S. cities between 2008 and 2011.We should note that the left has attacked Perry's numbers, saying they include legal as well as illegal immigrants. Nice try, but with millions of illegal immigrants ""legalized"" in seven successive amnesties primarily directed at Central Americans since 1986, the legals are often former illegals who got it free.What Perry points out is what's universally reported around the world — that illegals commit a disproportionate share of crimes. Which isn't surprising. Along with economic refugees and others, some of the most likely people to leave a country are its misfits.Cuba's Fidel Castro proved that in 1980 when he emptied his prisons and mental hospitals for the Mariel boatlift, triggering a crime wave that washed a lot of U.S. politicians out of office as the public reacted.Roughly 3.8% of the U.S. population are illegals. No other nation has such a large share, though Greece is close at 3.5%, according to the European Union-funded consortium Clandestino, which tracks illegal migrants.As in the U.S., Greek police report that illegals commit 65% of violent crimes, with gang violence central. The illegals from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are largely destined to hook up in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., with the immigrant gangs (MS-13, Barrio 18) that smuggle them in. Two weeks ago, L.A. reported its largest spike in violent crime since 2003, reversing a decade of decline.""Violent crime was up 2.9% with 8,610 crimes reported in the first six months of the year,"" the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a 12% spike in aggravated assaults from a year earlier. ""Aggravated assaults are the precursors to shootings and homicides,"" said Police Chief Charlie Beck.In Washington, meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police Department reports a 36% spike in homicides as of July, countering another long downtrend.In the wake of a record 3,000 Texas murders, expect a new crime wave with the latest border surge. ""That's unacceptable, and that's the reason we have to secure that border,"" Perry told TV talk show host Glenn Beck.If only other leaders were thinking so responsibly about this ugly reality.

1881,MS,"Supreme Court: Monday's headlines said that the justices delivered a crushing blow to public-sector unions with their Harris ruling. What, then, of private-sector unions? Will this decision also be bad news for them?By a 5-4 margin, the high court said in Harris v. Quinn that Illinois cannot ""compel personal care providers to subsidize speech on matters of public concern by a union that they do not wish to join or support.""Illinois is at the center of a nationwide campaign that has been brewing for more than 10 years in which in-home health care workers have been organized — forced, really — into public-sector unions under the tortured reasoning that they are government workers because some are paid by Medicaid.The movement began in Los Angeles in 1999, when the Service Employees International Union organized 80,000 workers, the Cato Institute's Andrew Grossman wrote Monday.Then it spread to Oregon and Washington through the Midwest and into the Northeast and Middle Atlantic. Of the roughly 500,000 in-home health care workers in the country, about 400,000 have been organized, according to the Manhattan Institute.The unions saw these workers as a new source of money to help offset their waning influence in the private sector and the resultant loss of membership.Writing for the Manhattan Institute, Daniel DiSalvo, assistant professor of political science at City College of New York, called in-home health care workers ""a critical area of union growth.""That might be starting to dry up, thanks to Monday's Supreme Court ruling that said they are ""partial public employees."" ""The SEIU,"" says DiSalvo, ""will now lose significant members and money in Illinois.""George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley believes the decision will have a wide impact that goes beyond significant losses in a single state. ""These home workers share a lot of attributes of the new emerging workforce, and for unions it's a big blow because that was their growth area,"" he told CNN.""And it's going to be very difficult now to extend these contracts to get those types of dues.""The Supreme Court's narrow ruling affects the 20,000 organized workers in Illinois and is not a death blow to organized labor as a whole. But, says DiSalvo, ""the case invites challenges in the other 25 states with similar legal situations.""It should also be an invitation for someone to eventually ask the court the rule on the practice of states forcing their employees to join unions and pay dues, a routine that was approved by the Supreme Court in its 1977 Abood v. Detroit Board of Education ruling.That decision — which went against a teacher, D. Louis Abood, who objected to union membership and union politics, and sued because he felt his First Amendment rights were abridged by the forced paying of union dues — stands on ""questionable foundations,"" said Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote for the majority in the Harris case.In deciding against the unions, the current court has created an atmosphere in which the country can ask if unions should have the power to force workers to join and pay dues as a condition of employment, a standard that has long been unquestioned.Harris is being categorized as a First Amendment issue.The court itself says the case posed the ""question whether the First Amendment permits a state to compel personal care providers to subsidize speech on matters of public concern by a union that they do not wish to join or support.""If so, isn't every union member, both in the public and private sectors, due the same First Amendment protection?This is no small matter. Citing a 2012 ruling — Knox v. Service Employees — Alito said a high standard is needed ""to overcome First Amendment objections"" that can occur when a worker is forced to pay union dues that go toward political speech he or she doesn't wish to financially support.While Congress and the courts have maniacally granted unions special privileges and protections through the decades, those advantages are not constitutionally shielded as free speech and freedom of association are.It's time to roll back the power given to unions at workers' expense and return a lost liberty to the workers whose freedom to dissent with union positions has been curtailed.This might be a fortuitous time, in other words, for Mr. Abood to meet Ms. Harris.

"
1894,MS,"Scandal: The endless stream of IRS visitors to the White House and the involvement of campaign donors in the Tea Party-targeting scandal belie the claim by the head of the agency that there is no White House involvement.The first thing investigators often ask in pursuit of criminal activity is who would benefit. That the Obama administration, burned in 2010 by the rise of the Tea Party and by the Citizens United decision, would benefit from the IRS' targeting and harassment of Tea Party groups spawned by grass-roots opposition to big government in general and ObamaCare in particular is beyond dispute.Yet IRS Commissioner John Koskinen repeated the argument by Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee at Monday night's hearing that enough evidence was in to dismiss the idea that the IRS scandal was a cover-up directed from the White House.That did not sit well with Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who noted that those who blame the GOP for raising a possible White House connection ignore some inconvenient facts. ""It was Jay Carney that perpetuated the myth that it was two rogue agents in Ohio. It wasn't any of us. Was that accurate?"" Gowdy asked the IRS chief.Gowdy also noted President Obama's insistence to Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that there was not a ""smidgeon of corruption"" at the IRS — an odd statement coming from a supposedly above-the-battle chief executive as investigations by both the Congress and the IRS Inspector General were still going on. That is, unless he was getting updates and assurances from IRS personnel all along.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked Koskinen how it was that he waited two months to tell Congress that critical Lois Lerner emails from the Tea Party-targeting period had been lost when Treasury and White House officials learned of it in April, the same month Koskinen says he was told by someone he can't remember on a date he can't remember. Koskinen said he has no idea who at the IRS told them about it. Well, somebody did, and there's no shortage of IRS candidates.On Tuesday, the House Oversight Committee had to issue a subpoena to Jennifer O'Connor of the White House Counsel's office for testimony, and it goes beyond White House claims of confidentiality and executive privilege. O'Connor was counselor to then-IRS commissioner Daniel Werfel from May to December 2013. Like Koskinen, she tap-danced around committee questions.As Chairman Darrell Issa noted in the subpoena announcement, ""Before her promotion to the White House, Ms. O'Connor led the response to the congressional targeting inquiry, and she is uniquely qualified to explain why attorneys did not focus on and flag Lerner's 'lost' e-mails at the outset."" It's also just one more interesting connection between the IRS and the White House.Was O'Connor's promotion to the White House counsel's office a reward for protecting the IRS and an attempt to protect her from congressional inquiries? Certainly it might be argued that Koskinen's current position is owed to four decades of being a prodigious Democratic donor.Koskinen has contributed to every Democratic presidential candidate since 1980, including $2,300 to Obama in 2008, and $5,000 to Obama in 2012.As we've noted, Nikole Flax, chief of staff to former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, who had similar problems with her hard drive, made at least 31 visits to the White House. The former IRS commissioner, Douglas Shulman, made some 118 visits.Flax, the Daily Caller reports, met twice in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building with Jeanne Lambrew, deputy assistant to the president for health policy, on Oct. 5, 2012 and Jan. 15, 2013. Lambrew, the Caller said, exchanged confidential taxpayer information on conservative groups in 2012 with IRS official Sarah Hall Ingram, who visited the White House 165 times.No White House involvement? To us, it seems like the IRS scandal's mission control.

1896,MS,"Scandal: One of the seven people, including Lois Lerner who lost emails from the period of Tea Party targeting by the IRS, served as chief of staff to former IRS head Steven Miller. She also made 35 visits to the White House.The funny thing about emails is that they are never orphans. When you send one, there's always a recipient who has his or her own copy. The ""lost"" Lois Lerner emails had recipients. How about subpoenas to all of them during the Tea Party targeting period? That should help find what we need to know — or maybe not.It seems six more IRS officials have lost critical emails from that period, a seeming statistical impossibility that shouts out a conspiracy to obstruct justice, and more violations of the Federal Records Act, which requires paper copies of these emails to be printed and stored just in case of computer problems.One of those officials who received Lerner emails and also lost them was Nikole Flax, chief of staff to former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller. Miller, who was fired in the wake of the targeting scandal, visited the White House more than most Cabinet members.Flax, as the Daily Caller reports, ""made 31 visits to the White House between July 12, 2010, and May 8, 2013, according to White House visitor logs.""While not quite as numerous as another former IRS Commissioner, Douglas Shulman, who made some 118 visits — including one he testified was for the Easter egg roll on the White House lawn — Flax's visits dovetail nicely with key points in the IRS scandal.The visits started just as the IRS' targeting of the Tea Party began; the last occurred two days before the scandal broke in May 2013. On the day of her last visit, according to the Daily Caller, Flax got an email from Lerner seeking advice on a plan to coordinate with the Justice Department to criminally prosecute conservative activists.Responding to this email, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch, Flax gave the green light to Lerner's plan to coordinate criminal prosecutions with DOJ, a suggestion that had been made by Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.We also know that Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings' staff was in contact with Lerner about the conservative group True the Vote.Whitehouse and Cummings might be two of the ""Democratic offices"" referred to in a statement from the House Ways and Means Committee when it derided IRS' claims that ""it cannot produce emails written only to or from Lerner and outside agencies or groups, such as the White House, Treasury, Department of Justice, FEC, or Democrat offices.""Committee Chairman Dave Camp and member Charles Boustany said in a statement:""The fact that Ms. Flax was a frequent visitor to the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building only raises more questions. Who was she visiting at the White House and what were they talking about? Was she updating the White House on the targeting or was she getting orders?""The loss of emails belonging to Flax, who coordinated possible criminal prosecution of Tea Party groups, is just too convenient. We might have only scratched the surface of direct White House involvement in a criminal conspiracy. Could the answer be found in the emails that Flax and six others, including Lerner, ""lost""?Or maybe, just maybe, they were deliberately destroyed, as was Lerner's hard drive? That would be a criminal conspiracy that would make Watergate indeed look like a third-rate burglary.

"
1924,MS,"THE COMPANY
"
1925,MS,"Arista Networks manages data traffic at large Internet centers for companies such as Facebook, Yahoo and Comcast (CMCSA). Its technology was initially embraced for high-frequency stock-trading environments, where fast data handling is vital. Then its use was expanded to elsewhere in the financial industry.

They include big cloud-service providers such as eBay, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo, as well as financial services organizations such as Barclays, Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS). One of Arista's largest customers is Microsoft, which accounted for 22% of revenue in 2013.
"
1932,MS,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
1933,MS,"The market for data-center technology is intensely competitive. Arista's rivals include Juniper Networks (JNPR), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Cisco Systems. Cisco is the dominant player in the data-switching category, with a market share above 60%.
"
1934,MS,"""Arista found an opportunity to break into Cisco's front yard, but Cisco has them in their sights,"" McKechnie said.
"
1935,MS,"Arista has a relatively short business history. Its first products shipped in 2008, though most of its revenue growth has occurred since early 2010. The company's 10 largest customers in 2013 accounted for 43% of revenue, up from 39% in 2012.
"
1936,MS,"THE RESULTS
"
1937,MS,"Arista's revenue comes primarily from sales of switching products and software, in addition to its services revenue. Arista revenue rose 87% to $361 million in 2013 from the same period a year earlier. The company reported net income of $42.5 million, up from $21.3 million. For the three-month period ended March 31, Arista reported revenue of $117.2 million, up 91% from the year-earlier period, and net income of $12.3 million. Not including proceeds from the IPO, Arista reports having cash and equivalents of $129.5 million.

Revenue dipped 1.8% to $20.1 billion, beating estimates for $19.4 billion.Citi shares jumped 4% to 47.49 on the stock market today.Citi has been dealing with a string of bad news lately.On Tuesday, it announced a $1.13 billion legal settlement with 18 institutional investors that wanted it to buy back billions of dollars' worth of residential mortgage-backed securities. Citi said that the deal would take $100 million off its Q1 earnings.Other legal woes include an investigation by U.S. officials into a $400 million loan fraud at Banamex, Citi's subsidiary in Mexico.On March 26, the Federal Reserve rejected Citi's capital plans to pay a higher dividend to shareholders through buybacks.But the loss at Citi Holdings, the bank's portfolio of troubled assets from the financial crisis, was only $292 million vs. $798 million in the year-ago quarter.Revenue at Citicorp, Citigroup's core business, fell 3% over the year-ago quarter, with net income falling 8% as bond trading and home mortgage lending dipped.The bank cut 2% of its workforce, 200 to 300 people, according to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal Monday.Bank of America (BAC) is slated to report results Wednesday with Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Thursday.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

2039,MS,"Big banks will start reporting their Q2 earnings results this week. Let’s take a closer look at the possible earnings picture of the six big banking companies that could drive the performance of the sector. This is especially true as the Major Banks industry accounts for about half of the sector’s earnings.According to our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Inside Our Surprise PredictionAmong the big six, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) are likely to report on Jul 13.JPM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +1.19%. This enhances the chances of an earnings beat this quarter. Wells Fargo, with a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of +0.33%, also has higher chances of an earnings beat.The case is different for Citigroup. A Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -2.56% lower the predictive power of ESP because a favorable Zacks Rank when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is expected to report on Jul 16 before the market opens. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -6.10%. Needless to say, surprise prediction is tough here.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Jul 18. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -3.12%. Here as well, an earnings beat is difficult to predict.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -0.54%, which dims chances of a beat.What Does ESP Tell About Bank ETFs?As discussed above, chances of a broad-based earnings beat are low as only two out of the six have a positive ESP. Total Q2 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry are expected to rise 8.2% from the same period last year. This would follow the industry’s 25.4% earnings growth in the preceding quarter, per the Earnings Trendsissued on Jul 5.The segment should pick up pace starting Q3 with the final two quarters of the year expected to see 11% and 15.3% growth, respectively. Fed’s policy tightening and the consequent higher bond yields as well as Trump’s deregulation and fiscal reflation should benefit the space.Market ImpactDespite the not-so-encouraging earnings prospects, investors might want to keep an eye on financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF IYF, Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) owing to upbeat factors like deregulation in the banking sector and faster Fed policy tightening. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (read: How Financial ETFs Look After Fed Stress Test).Goldman has moderate exposure to the aforementioned ETFs and is rather heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report). These ETFs have added 0.73% to 1.86% in the past five days (as of Jul 10). However, the returns in the space were lower than 2.53% offered by the S&P 500-based ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) (see all Financial ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

However, the blue-chip index remains below its 200-day moving average - a technical barrier to gauge the index’s long-term momentum trends - for the fourth straight session.The S&P 500 gained 0.6% led by 1.2% increase of Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), 1% rise in Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and 0.9% increase in Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in positive territory.Likewise, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8% due to strong showing by the large tech stocks.Financial Sector Soars on Stress Tests ResultsOn Jun 28, the Fed declared results of the second round of its annual stress tests. The central bank has given the nod to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the country to raise their dividends and buy back shares.Moreover, the yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note added 2.2 basis points to 2.849% due to soft economic data. Following these two news the financial stocks rallied reversing a 13-day losing streak.Consequently, major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) gained 1.6%, 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively.Technology Sector Return to Growth Path The decision of the online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) to diversify into healthcare boosted the entire technology sector.Amazon has agreed to acquire PillPack, an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. This development immediately triggered a surge in the entire tech sector. Investors welcomed Amazon’s decision to diversify into healthcare sector, especially in the fields of drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit management.As a result, the stock price of Amazon was up 2.5%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Economic Data The Department of Commerce revealed its third and final estimate of the U.S. GDP for the first quarter of 2018. The final reading was an increase of 2%, lower than the 2.2% growth it reported the last month. The consensus estimate was a growth of 2.2%.The lukewarm growth of GDP was primarily attributed to lower consumer spending which accounts for nearly 70% of the U.S. economy. For the first-quarter 2018, consumer spending was up 0.9% instead of the 1% increase reported earlier.

2041,MS,"Client activity seems to have returned to normalized levels, following the significant volatility recorded in the first quarter. Therefore, this will likely result in relatively stable trading revenues for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) in second-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute a substantial part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lend support to its results scheduled on Jul 16.Unlike the first quarter when higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, impending U.S.-China trade war and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility, developments like further escalation in the trade war and some other geo-political tensions in the second quarter were not enough to lead to substantial rise in client activity.Also, similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, at an investors’ conference in May, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan stated that the company’s trading income is expected to be flat year over year in the second quarter.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $4.12 billion indicates a decline of 14% from the prior quarter.Overall Earnings & Revenue Growth ExpectationsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 56 cents reflects a 21.7% increase on a year-over-year basis. However, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.5 billion indicates a 1.5% decrease from the prior-year quarter.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteClick here to know about the other factors that are likely to influence BofA’s overall results.ConclusionStabilizing trading revenues are expected to benefit this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s revenue growth (to some extent) in the second quarter.

2042,MS,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has been temporarily banned from selling chips in China. This dealt a severe blow to the stock price of the chipmaker, with other chip stocks following suit.But, the red-hot chip stock is, undoubtedly, ready to make a comeback. Micron, the world’s leading provider of innovative memory solutions, has had a mind-boggling run so far this year. The stock has gained 25%, compared with a 3.6% rise of the PHLX Semiconductor Index and 1.5% of the S&P 500.The chip industry, in itself, offers upside even after stellar years. From high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to automation demand for chips, all are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, supply is low which spells a grand period for chip stocks. Hence, it is the ideal time to capitalize on the current slump by betting on chip stocks that are poised to grow in the near term.Micron Stock Dives as China Blocks SalesChina’s Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court has issued an authoritative warning against Micron’s Chinese holdings blocking sales of PRC 26 DRAM and NAND-linked items. This included solid-state hard drives and memory sticks. The Boise, ID-based company’s subsidiaries like the Micron Semiconductor (Xi’an) Co were earlier charged for patent infringement by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (Jinhua) and Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. was slapped with the same charges.Micron is already embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, when the Chinese regulators launched an investigation into memory-chip pricing. Nonetheless, shares of the chipmaker tanked 5.5% to close at $51.48 on Jul 3 after hitting an intra-day low of $50.10. Markets remained closed on Jul 4 as the nation observed Independence Day.Shares of other semiconductor stocks did suffer due to the tussle between the Asian nation and Micron. China is fighting for advanced chip technology and knowhow, while the Trump administration intends to block additional technology exports to Beijing. Chipmakers, including Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), saw their shares decline 1.5%, 2.2% and 1.5% on Jul 3, respectively. The PHLX Semiconductor Index went down 1.8%, after the Chinese court ruling came out.  Micron Still Has Upside Potential, But Why?But, it isn’t doomsday for Micron or the semiconductor industry. Micron does generate half of its revenues from China, per Fact Set. However, semiconductors are components of products that are sold elsewhere added Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Thus, the adverse effect of high revenue exposure to China “is not as meaningful” as it can be for other industries. Micron’s chief financial officer Dave Zinsner forecasts fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.37 a share on revenues of $8 billion to $8.4 billion, better than analysts’ projection of $3.16 on sales of $8.02 billion. In fact, the chipmaker’s fiscal third-quarter 2018 profits more than doubled from the year-ago levels, while sales surged 40%. The chipmakers net income of $3.82 billion, or $3.10 per share, on sales of $7.8 billion, was up from $5.57 billion a year ago.And luckily for investors, top analysts are optimistic about further growth ahead. Top benchmark analyst Mike Burton said that “MU has progressed from a ‘cash burn’ to a ‘cash return’ story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle.” He has raised his price target to $80 per share (55% upside potential from the current price).Micron bear UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri has upgraded the stock from “Sell” to “Hold” and raised his price target from $42 to $60 (16.5% upside potential from the current price).Semiconductor Industry in the PinkBut, why just buy Micron? Semiconductor chips are much in demand, largely due to gaming, emergence of IoT and automation.E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production, while chips are an essential part of crypto mining as these provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.5 Solid Chipmakers for Your Portfolio Banking on the strengths, chipmakers are positioned to make a comeback in the near term. Since the long term bodes well for stocks after the initial dip, it will be wise to invest in such stocks. Furthermore, by purchasing stocks right after a dip, investors are essentially buying shares at a discount.

2043,MS,"Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG  -  Free Report) seeks to exploit Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) strong client base and its proficiency in providing solutions in order to boost revenues from its wealth management operations.Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ, is focusing on other areas to drive its bottom line as a persistent negative interest rate environment in the domestic economy has been making its lending business less profitable.Mitsubishi UFJ will be taking advantage of Morgan Stanley’s expertise and experience in turning wealth management business into a major revenue contributing source by reducing risk and divesting troublesome units, per Saburo Araki, CEO of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co Ltd (“MUMSS”).MUMSS is a joint venture of both the companies created in 2010 as a result of Mitsubishi UFJ's $9 billion investment in Morgan Stanley at the height of a financial crisis in 2008. It is a combination of investment banking operations of the banks.Mitsubishi UFJ is targeting wealthy Japanese clients such as actors, company founders and athletes, to lure them into higher-return products like mutual funds.MUMSS Fined for Spoofing MarketThe venture was recently slapped with a $1.97 million penalty as one of its dealers was accused of placing large volumes of buy and sell orders in August 2017 with no intention of executing them.This practice is called ""spoofing"" under which an illusory market activity is created to draw investors’ attention. Per Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Mitsubishi UFJ is thought to have made a ¥1.58 million profit from the resulting price fluctuations.Our TakeMitsubishi UFJ’s strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake expansion strategies.

2044,MS,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) are among the major banks which received the Fed’s green light to raise their dividends or repurchase shares.Among these, M&T Bank currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while all other banks carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2045,MS,"U.S. stock markets ended sharply lower on Wednesday erasing early hour gains as renewed uncertainty related to trade policies along with a decline in durable goods order in May rattled investor’s confidence. All three major indexes closed in negative territory as well as their lowest levels in almost a month. The broad-based market decline was led by a stiff fall in technology and financial sectors, which overshadowed strong rally of energy stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,117.59, declining 0.7% or 165.52 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also decreased 0.9% to close at 2,699.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,445.09, shedding 1.5% or 116.54 points. A total of 7.72 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.33 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2.58-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 4.11-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 2% to close at 12.50.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow lost 0.7% while closing at its lowest level since May 3. The blue-chip index ended 165.52 points lower after touching an intraday high of 285.91 points. This reflects the index’s largest intraday downslide since Feb 21. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average - a technical barrier to gauge the index’s long-term momentum trends - for the third straight session. Notably, 26 of the 30-stocks index closed in the red while 4 traded in the green.The S&P 500 dropped 0.9% and closed at its lowest level since May 29. Moreover, the benchmark index closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 8. Notably, 50-day moving average is a psychological barrier to gauge the index’s short-term momentum trends.The S&P 500’s decline was primarily led by 1.4% loss of the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and 1.3% decrease of both Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF). Some of S&P 500’s decline was curtailed by a 1.3% gain of Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the index ended in negative territory.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite shed 1.5%, finishing at its lowest level since May 31. Lingering trade tensions took a toll on large-cap tech stocks pushing the index in the red.Trade Conflicts Looms LargeOngoing trade related conflicts between the United States and its major trading allies like China, European Union, Canada, Mexico, to name a few continue shake up investor’s sentiments. Mixed signals to trade policies provided by the White House further worsening the situation.Yesterday, markets opened on a positive note as President Trump stated that he has decided to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), who will assess potential threat from Chinses investment in U.S. companies. This was a softer stand compared with Trump’s earlier decision to impose China specific investment restrictions.Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated the government can block any American joint venture in China if the firm transfers critical technologies to China. Moreover, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration’s revised approach related to Chinese investment in the United States should not be considered as a soft stand on China. Following these two developments, stock markets took sharp downturn.Technology and Financial Sectors: Major LosersTech stocks plunged yesterday due to heightening trade conflicts between the United States and China. U.S. tech giants operating in the fields of smartphone, software and Internet-based services, online video streaming and social networking generates a large chunk of their revenues from China.Retaliatory measures taken by China against U.S. restrictions will significantly affect the business model of these large tech companies. Consequently, share price of tech behemoths like Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) fell 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively.Yields on U.S. government bonds slips Wednesday on the back of ongoing trade conflicts which investors fear may result into a full blown trade war jeopardizing the global economic growth. Moreover, a decline of U.S. durable goods order in May weighed on business sentiment. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury Note lowered to 2.829, which stayed above 3% level earlier this month. As a result, major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) suffered 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively.Energy Sector Rally on Oil Price SurgeOn Jun 27, crude prices surged on the back of renewed fear of a global oil shortage in the second half of 2018. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $2.23 or 3.2% at $72.76 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was WTI’s highest close since Nov 26, 2014. Brent crude rose $1.31 or 1.7% at $77.62 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. This was its highest finish since May.Yesterday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that that U.S. crude supply declined by 9.9 million barrels for the week ended Jun 22. This was the largest weekly decline of U.S. crude so far this year reported by the EIA. Per the EIA report, gasoline stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles were unchanged.Consequently, share price of petroleum behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) rose 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Exxon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Chevron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Economic Data The Commerce Department reported that new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods and shipments dropped 0.6% in May driven by a drop in new orders for trucks and cars. Consensus estimate was a decline of 1%. April’s reading has been revised to 1% decline. The decline in May durable goods orders was almost broad-based. New orders for core capital goods fell 0.2% in May in contrast to 2.3% gain in April.The Commerce also reported that the U.S. trade deficit declined 3.7% to $64.8 billion in May. Advanced report on wholesale inventories showed a 0.5% gain in May. Advanced retail inventories rose 0.4%.The National Association of Realtors reported that U.S. pending home sales declined 0.5% to a reading of 105.9 in May.

2046,MS,"The Federal Reserve’s first round of stress test this year reflects that the nation’s biggest banks are ‘well capitalized.’On Thursday, the Fed released the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results. It shows that all 35 banks (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) are adequately capitalized to survive under tremendously difficult economic conditions.The tests, conducted annually since 2009, are a must for big banks. These are designed to ensure that these banks are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn.The Fed’s Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said, “Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession.”Detail Analysis of ResultsThis year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10% along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) reported CET1 ratio of 8.6%, highest among the four big banks. The other three — Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) — had their ratios above 7%. All these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from this, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions. However, in this year’s test, Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) have the last two positions with SLRs of 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. So, this might result in these two companies adjusting their capital plans.In a statement, Goldman commented that it did not agree with the Fed’s stress test results and intends to discuss the “divergence” before next week’s test. Additionally, Morgan Stanley stated that the results “may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make.”Notably, in response to recently passed Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, the Fed dropped CIT Group, Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and Zions Bancorporation from this year’s test. The act exempts banks with total consolidated assets of less than $100 million from this annual exercise.A Bigger Payout PossibleBanks are optimistic, given the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations. They are keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares).According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders are projected to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, nearly 25% more than last year. Among these, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (despite facing several probes and lawsuits related to business misconducts), Bank of America and Citigroup are expected to lead the race.But the clearance of the stress test does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the banks qualify for bigger capital deployment. The companies will have to wait till Jun 28 for approval of their capital plans.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2047,MS,"The Fed will be announcing the results of bank stress tests on Jun 21 and results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review (""CCAR"") on Jun 28. The tests, which are an annual affair and a must for banks since the 2008 financial meltdown, are designed to ensure that they are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn. Looking back, President Donald Trump in May signed the biggest rollback of bank regulations since the global economic downturn into law.The law has been designed to relax rules for all but the largest banks. The move is likely to significantly benefit community banks. And apart from suburban and rural banks, the new law is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. Bank stocks have been performing well ever since Trump came to power and with Fed having already made two rate hikes this year, banks are likely to finally get benefited.New Stress Test to Benefit BanksStress tests have been in place since 2008 and are considered one of the most important measures to assess the ability of banks to withstand an economic crisis. However, in May, Trump signed the biggest rollback of financial regulations since the Dodd-Frank Act came to effect in 2010. The new law has raised the assets threshold for banks that are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.This certainly has freed small banks from the burden of being considered too big to fail. Thus the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer need to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. Moreover, the new law cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks.The largest banks on the other hand will have to pass a stricter stress test. However, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests.Moreover, six foreign banks, namely Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), BNP Paribas SA (BNPQY  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report), Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG, have been included this year for the first time that will have to undergo the stress test.Banks to Pay Record DividendsDespite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks are expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders in the United States are estimated to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, almost 25% more than last year.Among these, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report) are leading the race. Per a Bloomberg report, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America is expected to pay out more than 100% of their profits over the next four quarters. These banks are likely to be followed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). JP Morgan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.This implies that the largest commercial banks are most likely to pass the Fed’s stress test. Moreover, the Fed too thinks that the banking sector has successfully entered the next stage of its recovery since the financial crisis. Moreover, the Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year, which has resulted banks in charging their customers more, thus making their financial position even better.Summing UpThe new law certainly has made things easier for small commercial banks. On the other hand, the large banks are likely to announce record payouts to their shareholders for the first time since the economic crisis, which proves that they are in a position to comfortably pass the stress test.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

2048,MS,"The Federal Reserve lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signalled at a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy heated up and inflation crawled higher.With the Fed hiking rates and aiming for more increases this year, banks, insurers and brokerage firms stand to gain. Meanwhile, utilities, homebuilders and gold miners are likely to lose.Fed Gets Slightly More HawkishThe Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Eight of the 15 Fed officials said that they expect interest rates to increase at least four times this year, up from seven in the March Fed rate meeting. The Fed’s dot plot, in fact, indicated that policy makers predict two additional rate hikes this year for a total of four increases instead of three as planned earlier.By the end of this year, the median forecast for the federal funds rate stands at 2.4%, compared with the March forecast of 2.1%. Beyond this year, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee predicts that it will hike rates three times next year and one more time the following year to propel its benchmark rate up to 3.4%.Fed’s View on Economy & InflationThe Fed’s decision reflected an economy that is improving by the day. After all, the jobless rate is at its lowest since 2000, wages are going up and consumers are pretty confident. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “most people who want to find jobs are finding them, and unemployment is low.” Lest we forget, for the first time in nearly 20 years, there are more job openings in the United States than workers to fill the positions.Fed officials also believe that the economy doesn’t require much help at the moment. Fed has removed the language that said the central bank expected federal funds rate “to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”Powell, in the meantime, added that the Fed is comfortable with the comeback of inflation. The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), has already touched the central bank’s 2% target during March and April. The Fed expects inflation to remain higher than 2% in the next two years. (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Beat the Fastest Rise in Inflation in 6 Years).Winners & Losers in a Rising Rate SettingWith the Fed raising interest rates and hinting at faster hikes, certain sectors stand to gain, while some sure have a lot at stake.Let’s take a look at the sufferers first –UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won’t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario. Utilities are capital intensive and funds generated from internal sources do not always meet requirements. Hence, these companies have towering debt loads. Low interest rates help them pay off debts and book profits.But higher rates along with an escalating debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.Home Construction Higher federal funds rate will make it more expensive for banks to borrow money, which eventually translates into higher borrowing rates for consumers. This is surely a dampener for real estate activities and losers, affecting construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.Mortgage rates are already on the rise. On average, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbed to 4.66% last month, the highest in seven years, before dropping slightly in recent weeks.GoldRising rates diminish the appeal of precious metals like gold because the commodity doesn’t offer yield as high as other safe haven assets like government bonds. Higher interest rates also boost the dollar and dent demand for dollar-denominated commodities.Following the Fed’s announcements, the ICE Dollar Index that measures the value of dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% to 93.898.Now, which areas are set to make the most of a rate hike? Of course, financials!BanksBanks are definitely the go-to rate trade now. As a rule, higher interest rates boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.National banks like the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are very rate-sensitive and have consistently seen earnings rise on a quarter-point rate hike.InsurersVery few companies root for a rate hike as much as those in the insurance industry. And why not? The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth.Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins.Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment.Asset ManagersBrokerage firms advantage significantly from an increasing rate environment since a hike in rates generally occurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Notably, a wealth management firm like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenues, much of which flows directly to pre-tax profits.Top 5 GainersGiven the aforesaid positives, we have selected five solid stocks from these winning areas that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).BankFinancial Corporation (BFIN  -  Free Report) operates as the holding company for BankFinancial, National Association that provides commercial, family, and personal banking products and services in Illinois.

2049,MS,"U.S. stocks rallied once again, with markets closing sharply higher on Wednesday. This saw two of the indexes closing at record highs. The rally was led by financial stocks, boosted by the rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield and partly supported by robust economic data and easing of trade war fears.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 1.4%, to close at 25,146.39, its best single-day percentage gain since April 10. The S&P 500 gained 0.9% to close at 2,772.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,689.24, increasing 0.7%. A total of 6.88 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.64 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The tech heavy Nasdaq gained 51.38 points, as tech stocks pared earlier losses. Also, the Nasdaq registered its third-consecutive all-time closing high.  The Dow gained 346.41 points to close above 25,000 points for the first time since Mar 12. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) was the best performer on the index gaining 3.2%. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 gained 23.55 points, to close at its highest level since Mar 12. The Financials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) was the best performer, gaining 1.8%. Of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, 10 ended in positive territory.Financial Stocks GainOn Wednesday, European Central Bank’s chief economist Peter Praet signaled the end of the bond-buying program. Praet said that the bank will discuss next week how to roll back the 30 billion euros ($35 billion) monthly-purchase program. This shows that the economy is on steady track and ECB, which is set to run its asset-purchase program through September, might slow purchases over the next few months, possibly ending by December.As a result of this, bond prices fell, pushing yields higher. The 10-year Treasury note rose 5.9 basis points to 2.975%, its highest since May 24. This led to a rally in financial stocks. Shares of JP Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) rose 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Also shares of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) gained 3.2% and 2.3%, respectively.Trade WarTrade war fears have been grpping markets for quite some time now. However, investors shrugged off trade war fears to some extent as on Wednesday after China announced that it will import $70 billion U.S. goods to huge trade deficit gap between the two countries. This reinstated investors’ confidence leading to a rally in stocks.April Trade Deficit Falls, Nonfarm Productivity IncreasesRobust economic data helped boosting investors’ confidence. The U.S. trade deficit fell 2.1% in April, hitting a seven-month low. Understandably, American’s bought less imported goods after Trump started imposing tariffs in March on a range of imported goods from China. Moreover, nonfarm productivity increased at the pace of 0.4% in the first quarter instead of 0.7% reported last month. Also factory output increased 2.7% instead of 2.8%.Stocks That Made HeadlinesDelta's Q2 TRASM View Bullish, Costs Guidance BearishDelta Air Lines, Inc.

2050,MS,"With an aim to provide access to its sophisticated alternative investment strategies to a broader client base, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) is reducing the minimum requirement for participating in various alternative investment strategies that the company’s asset-management arm offers.Per a Bloomberg report, the new limit has been set at $100,000, down from the previous requirement of $10 million. This reduction will increase access to certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies to the masses, which was restricted earlier only to institutions and the ultra-rich.For this, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the asset management arm of the bank, has agreed to use the technology of iCapital Network Inc.iCapital is a financial technology platform that offers alternative investments like hedge funds, private equity and real estate to high net worth individuals and other wealth advisors at lower minimums, thereby simplifying access to such investments for investors.Per the agreement, J.P. Morgan Asset Management will partner with iCapital so that high net worth investors and their advisors can access certain J.P. Morgan Global Alternative strategies by using iCapital’s digital platform.Anton Pil, Managing Partner of J.P. Morgan Global Alternatives said, ""As we get later in the economic cycle, identifying alternative sources of return is an essential consideration for investors looking to build stronger portfolios. Institutional clients have long embraced alternatives as a strategic part of their asset allocation, and many high-net-worth investors continue to be under-allocated to alternatives relative to their institutional counterparts.""He added, ""Given the current rising interest rate environment, investors are looking for alternative sources of income that provide diversification to broader fixed income markets, and as a result, we are starting with several of our income-focused Alternative Investment strategies.""By using such technological platforms, high net worth individuals will also be able to build portfolios without relying on the brokers for advice. This will reduce their investment costs as brokers charge commissions, which increases investors’ total expenses.Apart from JPMorgan, BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) works with iCapital. UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) have also been found to have an interest in the venture.Shares of JPMorgan have gained 33.2% in the past year, outperforming 20.4% growth of the industry.JPMorgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2052,MS,"As part of its efforts to expand into newer markets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) wants to set up a joint-venture brokerage in China. For this, the company is seeking approval from the securities regulator in the country.Gao Li, a spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, recently stated that J.P. Morgan Broking (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of JPMorgan, submitted an application to acquire 51% stake in a Chinese securities venture. Li also informed that the application will be efficiently reviewed by the regulator.This move by the bank comes after China pledged to open its financial markets for foreign investors. In April, the Chinese authorities released guidelines, giving permission to foreign companies to own a maximum 51% of their local securities joint ventures. Notably, the country is expected to remove all ownership limits for foreign companies after 3 years.JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon visited China a few days ago. He is optimistic about the company’s plans to expand into the Chinese economy and hopes that the increasing trade tensions will not create any barriers for the same.According to a person familiar with the matter, the company wants to learn more about investing in China so that it can cover more clients and hence expand its business in the country.A few days before JPMorgan’s application, other companies like UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Nomura Holdings, Inc. (NMR  -  Free Report) also submitted their applications for gaining control over 51% stake in the country’s securities joint ventures.Also, some other firms like Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. have a desire to control their joint ventures in China.Notably, while JPMorgan intends to expand into 15-20 new markets (starting in Virginia, Washington, DC and Maryland) by opening up to 400 new branches and hiring as many as 3,000 employees through 2023. It is also focused on increased automation with fewer employees. Thus, the company continues with its efforts to reduce the size of the branches, given the increased usage of online banking and ATMs.Shares of the company have gained 31.5% in the past year, outperforming 18% growth of the industry.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"
2053,MS,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growth has helped its shares skyrocket for more than a decade, which might leave some investors upset they didn’t buy Amazon stock a long time ago. Clearly, getting in on the ground floor would have been amazing, but now still looks like a great time to buy Amazon because Jeff Bezos’ behemoth is poised for more growth and is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Quick Overview Amazon forced the likes of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and nearly every other retailer to revamp their business models, bolster their e-commerce platforms, and push much faster into delivery. Meanwhile, the company’s AWS cloud hosting business is one of the biggest in the world and competes directly against likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report).The Seattle-based company has also expanded its entertainment offerings through Amazon Prime Video, spending billions on new content to compete with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Hulu. The company’s streaming music business hopes to take on Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Music. Amazon is also set to stream NFL games once again this season, and recently landed highly sought after Premier League rights.Amazon has also quietly grown its advertising business, expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint with bookstores and more experimental retail locations—not to mention Whole Foods. Meanwhile, the e-commerce power looks poised to further infiltrate key growth markets, such as India (also read: The Latest on Amazon's Booming Advertising Business).And this was just a quick overview of Amazon’s staggering scale. So now let’s move onto some more of Amazon’s current fundamentals.Price Performance Shares of Amazon have skyrocketed over 300% during the last three years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 34% climb, and also thoroughly outpaces Facebook's (FB) 139% surge, as well as Wall Street darling Micron’s (MU) 149% growth.Over the last year, Amazon’s stock price has climbed roughly 75%. Year to date, AMZN is up 46%, against the S&P 500’s 4.3% climb.Valuation Coming into Wednesday, Amazon was trading at 105.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which does mark a massive premium compared the S&P 500’s 17.3X. It is always worth remembering that Amazon doesn’t really care about earnings as it continues to pursue expansion.Yet, Amazon stock has traded as high as 282.7X over the last year, with a year-long median of 146.4X. AMZN is currently trading almost directly in line with its 52-week low, which means it is hardly a stretch to say that Amazon stock looks rather attractive at this current valuation.Let’s also take a quick look at the company’s forward P/E divided by its P/E to growth ratio or PEG, which is a somewhat more useful valuation metric to evaluate growth companies like Amazon. AMZN is currently trading at 3.5. This comes in above the S&P 500’s average of 1.8. But Amazon stock compares more favorably against its own history.AMZN stock has traded as high as 9.5 over the last three years and rested at 7.7 as recently as February. Amazon is also trading below its three-year median of 3.9 and currently presents a discount against fellow growth focused tech firm Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 3.6.Looking AheadLet’s close by quickly looking at Amazon’s growth outlook. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Amazon’s second-quarter revenues to surge by nearly 41% to $53.46 billion. The company’s full-year sales are projected to reach $237.97 billion. This would mark growth of roughly 34% from 2017, which is pretty incredible for a company of its size and age. The company well-known on Wall Street for casting earnings aside is projected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 525% to $2.50 per share. Amazon’s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to expand by 180% to reach $12.74 per share.Investors should also note that during the last 60 days, Amazon has earned 14 earnings estimate revisions for the second quarter, with nearly 100% agreement to the upside. During this same time period, Amazon received 17 upward revisions for the full-year against just one downward revision. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2054,MS,"Benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest-rate scenario have well positioned the banking industry. Moreover, tax overhaul and an expected ease in regulation could bring in more benefits.The March-end quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September, to some extent. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports affected the stock market rally in the quarter.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appeared that volatility was back in the markets, with extremities in February and March. This resulted in higher trading activities and increased fixed income and equity revenues, primarily for investment banks.Therefore, we are focusing on two major investment banks, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report).Goldman, with a market cap of $89.3 billion, operates as investment banking, securities and investment management company, globally. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, and has a market cap of $92.1 billion.Goldman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Though both banks have similar business trends, deeper research into the financials will help decide which investment option is better.Price PerformanceBoth banks have underperformed the industry (up 26.3%) over the past year, however, gained decently. While shares of Goldman have rallied 5.4%, Morgan Stanley has recorded growth of 21.8%. So, Morgan Stanley performed better than Goldman.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12-month period is 12.6% for Goldman and 11.1% for Morgan Stanley as compared with the industry’s level of 11.1%. Therefore, Goldman reinvests its earnings more efficiently. Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of Goldman has increased 6.6% over the last 30 days. On the other hand, the same for Morgan Stanley appreciated nearly 4.4% for this year, during the same time frame.Moreover, the current-year earnings for Goldman are projected to jump 17.8% year over year. For Morgan Stanley, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.72 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 31.1%.Hence, Morgan Stanley reflects better earnings growth prospects.Sales GrowthSales for Goldman for the current year are projected to move up 11.3% year over year to $8.8 billion. For Morgan Stanley, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.1 billion for 2018, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.8%.Therefore, Goldman has an edge here.Dividend YieldBoth companies have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholder value. Goldman has a current dividend yield of 1.27%, while Morgan Stanley has a dividend yield of 1.91%.Although both the stocks’ dividend yield is higher than the industry’s average of 0.62%, shareholders of Morgan Stanley gain more. Leverage RatioBoth Goldman and Morgan Stanley have higher debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 0.22. However, Goldman, with a ratio of 2.69, has an edge over Morgan Stanley, with a ratio of 2.75.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Goldman is better positioned than Morgan Stanley when considering sales growth expectations, leverage ratio and ROE. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley wins on price performance, dividend yield and earnings growth potential.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2055,MS,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) recently entered into an agreement with Gramercy Property Trust, wherein the former will acquire all the outstanding shares of the latter. The all-cash deal has been valued at $7.6 billion.Per the agreement, affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII will pay $27.50 for each of Gramercy’s shares. Notably, the offer represents a premium of 15% to Gramercy’s closing price on May 4.Gramercy is a commercial real estate manager that specializes in acquiring and managing high-quality, income-producing commercial real estate leased to high-quality tenants in the United States and Europe. Based in New York, the company had total liabilities of nearly $3.14 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.Gordon DuGan, Trustee and the chief executive officer of Gramercy said, “I speak for Ben Harris, Nick Pell and the entire team at Gramercy to say that we are very pleased to enter into this transaction. We believe this validates the quality of the portfolio and platform that we have built. Entering into this transaction with Blackstone fulfills our Board of Trustees’ mission to maximize shareholder value.”In recent years, Blackstone's real estate business has been a major contributor to its earnings growth. Since the past few years, the private equity owner of real estate has been making a shift toward industrial real estate.

2056,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because MS recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 6 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if MS stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.

2057,MS,"The Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) has reached a settlement with two U.S. authorities to settle claims that its traders wrongfully shared information regarding orders of its customers, with motives of taking advantage of the market.Goldman would be paying $54.7 million each to the New York’s Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve. Also, it is required to submit in writing, plans to improve internal controls and strengthen risk management program.The Wall Street biggie was accused of using multi-party electronic chat rooms to share private information about clients using code names like “satan”, “fiddler”, etc with other global banks for a span about five years (ending early 2013), in exchange of information about potential bids or prices for particular currencies.These improper trading activities affected currency prices, which the banks used to their advantage for achieving higher profits at the cost of customers.In a similar probe, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanly (MS  -  Free Report) were fined $2.96 million in January 2018 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both the companies were accused of misleading investors about a foreign exchange trading program by not disclosing about the actual burden to be taken by investors.Moreover, back in 2015, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS  -  Free Report) and Barclays had paid about $5 billion for conspiring to rig rates by forming a so called — Cartel.Close scrutiny by financial regulators helps keep big banks from exploiting customers. Though the current settlement might impact Goldman’s financials to an extent, it remains well poised to gain from the favorable market conditions.Shares of Goldman have gained 6% over the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 25.4%.Currently, Goldman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2058,MS,"It isn’t hard to appreciate the market’s negative reaction to the Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) reports, but the lukewarm reaction to JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) report is likely reflective of continued weak sentiment for the group.The fact is that JPMorgan’s report represented all around strength and offers useful read-throughs for what to expect from pure-play investment banks, trust banks and regional operators in the coming days. We have a busy reporting docket this week, with more than 170 companies coming out with quarterly results, including 60 S&P 500 members.  As you can see in the year-to-date performance comparison of Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo shares relative to the S&P 500 index (orange line), the banks have lagged the broader market, with Citi and Wells doing real bad.As discussed in this space last week, a big contributor to the group’s recent underperformance is the flattening yield curve. Lately, yield spreads have compressed significantly as the shorter end of the curve has gained ground in response to the market’s Fed expectations while long-term yields have been held down by lack of inflation expectations and safe-haven flows around the trade uncertainty.   With respect to the actual results, there is plenty to like in the JPMorgan report while Citi’s results were modestly disappointing and Wells’ report was weak as well as ‘noisy’. JPMorgan’s loan portfolio increased a respectable +4% from the same period last year and +2% from the preceding period. Earnings at the bank’s investment banking unit increased +18% from the year-earlier period, with trading revenues increasing +13%. The one area of weakness was the mortgage unit, with mortgage volume down -10% and revenues down -6% from the year-earlier period.Mortgages are a much bigger deal with Wells Fargo, with earnings in the bank’s mortgage unit down by almost a third from the same period last year and the overall loan portfolio down -1.4% from the earlier period. The bank had a number of ‘charges’ in its report as well, though we don’t exclude these charges from the bank’s ‘recurring’ earnings as these charges have effectively become a regular part of its results as it continues to put the September 2016 scandal behind it. The combination of increased outlays for regulatory and compliance strictures and weakness in the mortgage business resulted in -2.5% lower earnings on -2.8% reduction in revenues.The Citi disappointment is centered primarily on weakness in trading and credit cards, with trading revenues down -1% from the year-earlier period even though management had guided towards a flat showing on this count. The bank’s loan portfolio was up +4% while expenses were flat from the year-earlier period. Thanks to lower taxes, Citi’s Q2 earnings were up +16.2% from the same period last year on +3.2% higher revenues.Finance Sector Scorecard (as of Friday, July 13th)We now have Q2 results from 4 of the 99 Finance sector companies in the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind however that these 4 companies account for 21.3% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the index.Total earnings for these 4 Finance companies are up +11.4% from the same period last year on +3.6% higher revenue growth, with 75% beating EPS estimates and 100% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context.As you can see in the chart above, the sector’s growth picture is tracking above the 4- and 12-quarter averages, but below what we had seen from these stocks in the preceding quarter. These comparisons will likely change as Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) report quarterly results next week.For the quarter as a whole, total Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +21% from the same period last year on +3.6% higher revenues. This would follow +25.1% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +4.8% higher revenues.The table below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings expectations at the medium industry level. We show Q2 expectations in the context of what was actually reported in the preceding three quarters and what is expected in the following four periods at the medium-industry level.The chart below shows the same data at the aggregate sector level. The strong earnings growth of the first half of 2018 is expected to continue in the back half as well.Please note that the sector’s strong growth this year is for the most part to thanks to the tax legislation. You can see that in the above chart by focusing on the revenue growth pace (orange bars). Revenue growth for the group is positive, but nothing to get overly excited about.Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of July 13th, 2018)We now have Q2 results from 27 S&P 500 members, with total earnings for these 27 companies up +19.1% from the same period last year on +9.7% higher revenues, with 88.9% of the companies beating EPS and revenue estimates.We probably shouldn’t draw any firm conclusions from the results thus far, but this is nevertheless a good start to the Q2 reporting cycle, as the comparison charts below show.The way to read these charts is that Q2 earnings and revenue growth (left-hand chart) for these 27 index members is above the 4- and 12-qurater averages, but the comparison to the preceding period (2018 Q1) is mixed, with earnings growth (+19.1%) tracking below and revenue growth (+9.7%) inline. Overall Expectations for 2018 Q2 Looking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 27 index members with estimates from the still-to-come 473 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +19.5% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.7% revenue growth, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index shows that we will be in a good position to gauge trends by the end of this week, as we will have seen results from 87 index members by then.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 4 quarters.When market commentators talk about earnings growth peak, it is the growth comparison in this chart they are referring to. Looking at this chart, it is obvious that growth has peaked already, with the pace decelerating going forward.We should keep in mind however that actual results typically come in better than expected, with actuals exceeding estimates in the 3% to 5% range. This means that the 19.5% growth pace currently expected in Q2 will likely be closer to the 2018 Q1 tally when all is said and done.The chart below shows the growth pace on trailing 4-quarter basis, which tends to smooth out the quarter-to-quarter jumps.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while second chart shows the expected to ‘peak’ to arrive in the last quarter of the year.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

2059,MS,"The S&P 500 financials sector rebounded nearly 1% on Jun 28, breaking its 13-day slump. Shares of all major banks jumped after the Fed announced the results of the final leg of the annual stress-test exercise, known as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The Fed gave an OK to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the United States that hold 80% of the total assets in the U.S. financial system, to raise their dividends and buy back shares.Interestingly, despite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks were widely expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. However, two of Wall Street’s biggest banks, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), failed two of the qualitative stress tests run by the Fed on banks’ capital plans.Consequently, the Fed asked Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to maintain their capital distribution at roughly last year’s level. Moreover, the U.S. arm of Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), failed the stress test, with the Fed rejecting its capital plan.Banks to Pay Higher DividendsMost of the major U.S. banks announced their dividend payout and share buyback plans after results from the second and final of stress test were announced. Despite a few stumbles in the test, the big banks are expected to pay $170 billion in combined dividends for the coming four quarters, as expected by analysts earlier. This is nearly $30 billion more than in the previous 12 months.The country’s four major banks, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo &Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup, Inc. (C  -  Free Report) will offer more than $110 billion through dividends payouts and share buyback. Post stress test results, as many as 20 banks announced their share buyback and dividend payout plans for the next four quarters.Bank Stocks ReboundAlmost a decade after the recession, profits of banks are steadily rising and they are lending more freely. This had made investors hopeful that banks would be paying out higher dividends this time. This saw bank stocks rebounding, with the S&P 500 Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gaining 0.9%.JP Morgan hinted at a 43% increase in its quarterly dividend and buy back of $20.7 billion in shares, while Wells Fargo will increase its quarterly dividend to 43 cents from 39 cents. American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) announced that it will increase its dividend by 11% and buy back $3.4 billion worth of shares.This saw shares of JPMorgan Chase and Well Fargo increase 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup jumped 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. The robust performance by banks stocks saw the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index increasing 0.6% on Thursday. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley FalterThe Fed forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to maintain their capital distribution to roughly last year’s level after the two major lenders failed to pass two important parts of the qualitative stress tests. According to results, both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had higher leverage than Fed’s requirement.However, the banks were given conditional no-objections to their subdued capital plans. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had last week said that they won’t return more than $6.8 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, in capital in the year starting in third quarter.Both banks raised their dividend by 5 cents each. The figures are certainly disappointing, as both banks last week had hinted that they were confident of returning more capital to their shareholders than the figures of regulators suggested. However, shares of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley jumped 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Goldman Sachs has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2060,MS,"Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) dipped in morning trading Tuesday, shortly after the company reported its first-quarter earnings results. Goldman surpassed estimates on the top and bottom line, but it is possible that a solid report was already priced in to the stock. Nevertheless, investors will now shift their focus to the upcoming earnings announcement from fellow investment banking giant Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report).Goldman continued the trend of strong trading revenue that was first evidenced by consumer & investment hybrid banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report).The financial behemoth posted 31% growth in its Institutional Client Services division—led by elevated net revenues from commodities, currencies, and credit products—as well as 43% growth in its Investing & Lending segment—largely thanks to a surge in revenues from investments in equities and debt securities.Morgan Stanley investors will hope the company can report similar growth. Let’s take a closer look at what the latest estimates are saying.Latest Outlook and ValuationBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect Morgan Stanley to report earnings of $1.28 per share and revenue of $10.45 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 28.0% and 7.2%, respectively. It is worth noting that Morgan Stanley’s earnings estimates have trended higher recently, adding about seven cents over the quarter.We can also turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to prepare for the report. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to these consensus estimates, Morgan Stanley is poised to post revenue of $2.14 billion in its Institutional Securities, Equity business. This would mark growth of 5.9%, which is a significant improvement from the 1.5% decline witnessed in the previous quarter. Nevertheless, investors will expect Morgan Stanley to outperform in this unit.Heading into today, MS was trading with a Forward P/E of 11.5, which is basically in line with its industry’s average of 11.9. Within the past year, the stock has traded as high as 14.8x forward 12-month earnings and as low as 11.3x. Its median earnings multiple over that time is 12.4x. Investors might conclude that MS shares are slightly discounted compared to their recent valuations.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Morgan Stanley surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Morgan Stanley is currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.0%. This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been in line with the consensus. In other words, our model is not conclusively calling for a beat.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Morgan Stanley’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. The firm has met or surpassed estimates in each of the trailing nine quarters, and the stock has a solid record of gaining momentum during earnings season.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Over the course of Morgan Stanley’s streak, shares have turned positive in seven of these windows.Want more market analysis from this author?

2062,MS,"U.S. stock markets ended in negative territory on Monday as a broad-based decline pushed all three major indexes in red. Slide into the healthcare and industrial stocks more than offset gains from several merger and acquisitions (M&A) except a telecom mega deal. Moreover, strong first quarter earnings results also failed to uplift investor’s sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,163.15, declining 0.6% or 148.04 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.8% to close at 2,648.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,066.27, decreasing 0.8%. A total of 6.81 billion shares were traded on in the first trading day of the week, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.57 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.74 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.99 to -1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 3.4% and closed at 15.93.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow decreased 0.6% with 25 stocks of the 30-stock blue-chip index closing in the red while five traded in the green.The S&P 500 decreased 0.8% led by 1.5% decline of the Health care Select Sector SPDR (XLV), 1.3% decrease of Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB). Each of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and 11 new 52-week lows.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8%.  The index recorded 55 new 52-week highs and 46 new 52-week lows.Healthcare, Metal and Industrial Stocks Pull Down the MarketHealthcare, metal and industrials sectors were the worst performers in the last day of trading in April. These three sectors led a broad-based market decline.Shares of Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) declined 4.5% after a Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) report stated that the company will require one-to-three years more to resubmit its applications for the U.S. approval of the company’s critical drug ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.Shares of Allergen plc (AGN  -  Free Report) plunged 5.2% after its Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders expressed his view’s that he is opposed to any changes of the company’s fundamental business structure. (Read More)  However, Allergen’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $3.74 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36. Revenues generated $3.67 billion, which marginally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.59 billion.Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) declined a massive 20.6% after reducing its 2018 outlook. The company’s adjusted earnings came in at $0.34 per share for the first quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.32. Revenues of $3,445 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,329.6 million.However, Arconic now expects adjusted earnings in 2018 to be in the range of $1.17-$1.27 per share (down from prior guidance of $1.45-$1.55) and free cash flow to be around $250 million (down from $500 million).

Net earnings came in at $0.09 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.03. Revenues generated $1,659 million exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,549 million. Investors were expecting more especially after President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel.Concern on Telecom Mega Deal Overshadows Slew of M&AsA number of M&As announcements helped markets advance in the initial hours of trading. Shares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) increased 1.3% after the retail giant’s U.K. arm, ASDA Group Ltd., agreed to merge with British supermarket chain J Sainsbury plc. Likewise, shares of ILG Inc. (ILG  -  Free Report) rose 4.5% after Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corp.

(MRO) agreed to buy the former.However, investor concerns regarding the approval of a $26.5 billion merger deal between T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) overshadowed investor’s positive enthusiasm over these M&As.Share price of T-Mobile US and Sprint declined 6.2% and 13.7%, respectively as many industry watchers believe that the FCC may not okay the deal. Even if the deal is permitted, it will be detrimental to consumers since number of national wireless operators will come down to three from four.Economic Data The Department of Commerce reported that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) grew $67.1 billion or 0.4% in March, the first advance since the end of 2017. Personal income increased $47.8 billion or 0.3% and personal disposable income increased $39.8 billion or 0.3% in March.PCE price index, a key inflation barometer used by the Fed, rose to 12-month rate of 2% from 1.7% in February, hitting the central bank’s target for the first time in a year.

The Dow and S&P 500 each increased by 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%. Year to date, Nasdaq Composite is trading in the green while both Dow 30 and S&P 500 are in red.Strong earnings results by most of the large U.S. corporates failed to enthuse investors. Disappointing guidance by Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, led to losses for tech majors, especially Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Moreover, Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) forecast that economic growth might decelerate later this year also resulted in a broad-based market decline.  Rising bond yields also dented investors’ confidence. In April, the 10-year Treasury yield briefly hit the psychological 3% mark for the first time since January 2014.Additionally, stock markets fluctuate due to the fear about a global trade war and geopolitical tensions related to Syria.Stocks That Made HaedlinesBP Posts Strong Q1 Earnings on Record Upstream BusinessBP plc (BP  -  Free Report) reported strong first-quarter 2018 results as oil price has started to recover from the slump witnessed nearly four years back.

2063,MS,"Future estimates for stock market returns are at the lowest since the financial crisis due to overvaluation, increased inflationary pressure leading to rate hikes and telltale signs of a collapse in global growth. This perhaps explains why the latest round of encouraging earnings news failed to excite investors.Broader markets, in fact, see meager returns in the May-October period, thanks to lower trading volumes in summer, while the November-April period witnesses a substantial increase in investments. To top it, Mays during midterms tends to be worse, as is the case this year.In the wake of this, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments. Such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Dampening Outlook for ReturnsThe outlook for returns from U.S. stocks, which have been on an extensive bull run, is pretty unwelcoming. Expectations for returns are now at an 11-year low, according to Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). The financial holding company cited changing monetary policy and slowdown in global growth as the primary factors hurting returns.The Fed’s low rates and bond buying program helped markets move north over the past decade. But, the central bank is gradually altering its monetary policy by hiking rates and streamlining the balance sheet. A hawkish Fed coupled with an uptick in prices of essential commodities is a potential deterrent for stocks. Increased oil prices and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflationary fears. Investors also continue to fret about the likelihood of an inverted yield curve that has been viewed as an indicator of a pending economic recession.Many market participants are spotting cracks in synchronized global growth raising fears of a stagflation. This is a situation that mostly occurs at times of high inflation and unemployment along with weak economic demand. Maybe, the concern of a slowdown in global economic growth has cast a shadow on the quarterly results of U.S. corporations. Major bourses have been trading in a tight range for the last three months, with the Dow and the S&P 500 currently in their longest stretch in correction territory in a decade.Stocks Trade at Tight Range Since FebruaryThe stock market trading in a tight range, in fact, shows that enthusiasm over equities has been dissipating. Only 32.7% of investors expect stock prices to be at a higher range in 12 months from now, per data by the Conference Board.Stock valuations are already at multi-year highs raising questions as to whether the equity market has more room to scale higher. To top it, trading volumes have been unusually low, which indicates that investors are reluctant to participate.Fear the Month of MayAnd how can we forget the adage “Sell in May and go away.” Historically, stocks have underperformed in the six-month period commencing May and ending in October, compared to the November to April period. Mostly lower trading volumes in the summer season and substantial increase in investment during the winter months are cited to be the reasons for this discrepancy.In fact, May is traditionally bad in midterm election years, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Since 1950, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost 0.7%, 0.9% and 1.2% on average during midterm years, respectively.Buy 5 Top Dividend Stocks NowWith so many concerns plaguing investors’ minds, dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment. The best dividend stocks pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects, and are less susceptible to market gyrations. Their large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer sizable yields on a regular basis, regardless of market direction.While finding companies that offer these traits isn’t easy, they certainly do exist. To help you find these businesses, we have selected five dividend payers who have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Las Vegas Sands Corp.

2065,MS,"Markets ended mixed on Monday, as tech stocks continued to suffer and rising bond yields dented investors’ confidence. However, optimism about earnings prevented markets from declining further.

Tech stocks have been suffering for quite some time now leading to huge selloffs post Facebook’s data misuse scandal in early March. However, fears further escalated after Morgan Stanley(MS  -  Free Report) on Friday predicted that iPhone sales would soften in the June quarter. The fears persisted through Tuesday, taking further toll on tech stocks.Google’s parent Alphabet was marginally up for while after the company announced its quarterly results. Alphabet, which reported a 73% rise in profits in the first quarter, momentarily saw its shares rising. However, it ended the day in red as investors panicked. 10-Year Treasury Note Touches 4-Year High, Earnings Balance the LossesConcerns surrounding expectations of rising inflation and increasing supply of government debt saw stocks taking a hit once again on Monday, as the 10-year Treasury yield reached its highest level since 2014.

2066,MS,"Tech stocks have been feeling the heat for quite a while now with all major players taking a beating. The latest prediction by Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) that iPhone sales will soften in the June quarter has further taken its toll on tech stocks. Last week, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report) came up with a weak financial outlook, which also had a domino effect on the entire technology sector, especially on semiconductor stocks.Moreover, fears of a trade war with China, which undoubtedly will affect the tech companies the most, saw tech stocks plummeting. Tech stocks have been suffering since the beginning of March with Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) leading the rout after it was accused of a data breach. Worries further escalated after President Donald Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) to bash Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) about its business policies.However, tech stocks literally drove the markets in 2017 and also this year till February. Also, there’s high optimism around an exceptional earnings season from tech stocks. Moreover, the fundamentals which powered the ascent of tech stocks remain firmly in place. This is why it makes good sense to buy sector plays on the dip ahead of their next rebound.Low iPhone Sales Prediction, TSM’s Weak Outlook Add to WorriesTech stocks have been bleeding for quite some time now. Shares of all major tech companies have taken a hit over the last one-and-a-half month. And if this wasn’t enough Morgan Stanley last week predicted that iPhone sales will soften in the June quarter. This saw not only shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) trending down but other tech giants suffering too. Apple’s shares have declines 7.4% in the last five days.The week sales projection of iPhone follows a bleak financial outlook provided by Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. The company stated that its second-quarter 2018 revenues are likely to fall in the range of $7.8-$7.9 billion, lagging the consensus estimate of $8.5 billion. Consequently, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor declined 5.6%.The weak outlook took a toll on the entire tech sector, especially on the semiconductor stocks such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Given that Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest chipset supplier to both Apple and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), shares of these too companies plummeted.Facebook, Amazon, Trade Fears Hit Tech StocksDespite having a brilliant run in 2017 and early this year, tech stocks started feeling the heat since the beginning of March. The initial fears were sparked after Trump announced tariffs on a wide range of products imported from China. This spread panic among investors which further escalated once China imposed retaliatory tariffs, igniting fears of a trade war. The tech sector will be one of the worst victims if a trade war happens. This dented the confidence of investors with shares of most tech companies sliding.Moreover, Facebook, which got embroiled in a data misuse scandal that affected the personal data of more than 80 million users, did its share of damage to the tech stocks. Facebook, which was one of the best performing tech stocks last year saw it market capitalization erase by $100 billion in just a week. Facebook’s data misuse scandal made the entire sector suffer on fears of a regulatory clampdown.And to add to the woes followed Trump’s series of tweets bashing Amazon for its tax treatment. Trump has time and again lashed out at Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos saying that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This once again saw the company’s shares suffering a blow.Our ChoicesGiven the bad phase for the tech stocks, investor concerns are only natural. However, this sector has been driving the markets this year and was one of the significant beneficiaries of a roaring rally last year.Moreover, trade war fears too somewhat seem to have eased for the time being. Also, the earning season is off to a strong start and there is huge optimism around tech stocks putting up a stellar show this time around like the last many.Given this scenario, it will not be too ambitious to expect a rebound in the near term.

2067,MS,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q1 earnings releases. The going is great so far, with five big banks crushing estimates on both lines and one reporting mixed results. The backdrop should favor the banks along with the course of oil, the stance of the Fed and proposed policies of Trump.However, the restrained benchmark U.S. Treasury yields since mid-March, thanks to geopolitical risks and the tech space crash, is a concern for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at major banking earnings in detail:Big Bank Earnings in FocusJP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) reported earnings of $2.37 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28 in the first quarter of 2018. Also, the figure reflected a 44% rise from the year-ago period.Net revenues as reported were $27.9 billion in the quarter, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.8 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and increase in trading revenues were the main reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by lower investment banking revenues.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earned $1.12 per share in Q1, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 and improving from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.03. The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.7 billion. However, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s tally of $22.3 billion.Wells Fargo appeared to have failed to benefit much from higher interest rates as rival JPMorgan did. Wells Fargo’s net interest margin was flat with the preceding quarter and down from the year-earlier level.Citigroup Inc.’s (C  -  Free Report) earnings per share of $1.68 for Q1 were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 and the year-ago figure of $1.35 per share. Revenues were up 3% year over year to $18.9 billion in the reported quarter. The revenue figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Citi’s FICC revenues were down 7% in Q1.Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 62 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Also, the figure was 38% higher than the prior-year quarter number. Net revenues came in at $23.1 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.9 billion.Thanks to strong fixed income trading revenues, Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 22.6%. The company reported earnings per share of $6.95, breezing past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67. Further, the bottom line witnessed 35% year-over-year improvement. Goldman’s net revenues were up 25% year over year to $10 billion in the quarter under review. The figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.9 billion.Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings from continuing operations of $1.45 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. The reported figure was 45% above the prior-year quarter. Net revenues amounted to $11.1 billion, reflecting a rise of 14% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.5 billion. FICC trading sales rose 12% during the quarter.Market ImpactInvestors, who have still their hopes pinned on a decent earnings season, Trump’s promises for deregulation and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) responded to the earnings releases. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (see all Financial ETFs here).Goldman and Morgan Stanley are not that prominent in the afore-mentioned ETFs, rather these are heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report).ETF PerformanceMost of these ETFs gave downbeat to decent performances in the last five days (as of April 17, 2018), in the peak of banking earnings releases. IAI gained 1.3% thanks to Goldman’s blockbuster earnings, IYF was up only 0.03% but VFH, IYG, XLF and KBWB lost in the range of 0.54% to 1.9%.Downbeat investors’ mood following Wells Fargo and Citi’s earnings have probably kept the whole sector from shooting higher. Goldman Sachs shares suffered for “halting buybacks”. However, Morgan Stanley’s blockbuster performance at the end should charge up the space ahead (read: Will Bank ETFs Sizzle on Fed & Trump Influenced Q1 Earnings?).Overall, the finance sector’s earnings are expected to be up 22.6%, as per the Earnings Trends issued on Apr 13, 2018. Among this, big banks are expected to log a 19.2% expansion in Q1. So, one can easily forget Wells Fargo and Citi woes and bet on the prospects of the sector, tax reform and deregulations with the financial ETFs in focus (read: Welcome Powell Era With These ETFs).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2069,MS,"Markets closed higher on Friday, the last trading session of the first half of the year, as energy stocks rallied. However, trade war fears saw all three major indexes ending lower for the week. Friday also marked the end of the month, the second quarter and the first half of the year.  Markets saw mixed performance during this period.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.2%, to close at 24,271.41. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to close at 2,718.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,510.30, increasing 0.9%. A total of 7.16 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.28 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 55.36 points, with shares of Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) soaring as much as 11.1% to touch an all-time high. The company reported a return to growth in North America. Nike has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 added 2.06 points, lead by a rally in energy stocks. The blue-chip index rose as much as 200 points at one point but shed most of the gains in the afternoon. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 0.7%, on concerns of oversupply, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) increased 0.4%. The tech heavy Nasdaq gained 6.62 points.For the week, the Nasdaq lost 2.37%, while the Dow and S&P 500 lost 1.26% and 1.33% respectively. The Dow declined for the third consecutive week, the first time in more than two years.Energy Stocks Gain, Late Selloff Hit Bank Stocks Energy and materials stocks helped markets on Friday, which saw the Dow increase as much as 293.47 points at one point. However, a huge selloff in banks stocks erased early gains. Bank stocks performed well almost throughout the day after the Fed announced the second round of the stress test results. This saw most major U.S. lenders announcing high dividend payouts and share buybacks, which saw bank shares rallying.However, a late session selloff saw markets shedding the initial gains. Shares of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) lost 1.7%, 0.7%, 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively.Monthly RoundupMost of the month saw volatility in markets with stocks returning mixed performances. Trade war fears, which have gripped markets for quite some time, took its toll on stocks throughout the month. President Donald Trump once again threatened to impose tariffs of $200 billion worth of goods imported from China, which led top huge selloffs.June was also an eventful month that saw the historic meeting between Trump and North Korea’s premier Kim Jong-un. However, markets had high expectations from the meeting but not much impact was seen with stocks tumbling the day after the meeting.Moreover, as anticipated the Fed increased interest rates by 0.25% and hinted at two more hikes by the end of this year. Also, the Fed announced the annual stress test results for banks and gave OK to 32 of the 35 biggest banks in the United States to raise their dividends and buy back shares. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gained 0.9% and 0.5% for the month, while the Dow lost 0.6%.Quarterly Round UpThe second quarter was marked by tremendous volatility in markets. Trade war fears, which had started taking its toll on stocks in the end of first quarter, escalated in the second quarter. While Trump continued to create pressure on China to decrease the trade deficit by imposing tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, China too imposed retaliatory tariffs.This dented investors’ confidence leading to huge sell offs. Tech stocks, which have been driving markets for quite some time, too weren’t spared with all major tech gains suffering. However, a series of meetings between U.S. and China to reach a possible agreement saw trade war fears easing for some time, resulting in a rally in stocks.However, the quarter again ended with geopolitical tensions escalating as Trump continued with his tariff threats.  Despite trade related concerns, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow gained 2.9%, 6.3% and 0.7%, respectively, for the quarter.Half-Yearly Round UpAfter an outstanding 2017, markets touched record highs in January. However, the joyride came to a halt in February, when Trump for the first time announced his plans of imposing additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China. Things soon took the shape of a trade war, as China too threatened to retaliate.The EU, Canada and Mexico too opposed Trump’s plans of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum. After the United Stated finally imposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, China retaliated with tariffs worth $50 billion worth of U.S. goods. This raised fears of a trade war making investors jittery and leading to huge selloffs.Moreover, tech stocks, which have been on a rally since 2017 also took a hit after Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) got embroiled in a data-misuse scandal that affected more than 80 billion users. This saw not all tech stocks plummeting on fears of regulatory clampdown.That said, the U.S. economy showed signs of bullishness. The unemployment rate hit a 18-year low. The Fed, as expected, raised interest rates twice and hinted at another two hikes by the end of this year. The last week of the first half of the year also saw U.S. inflation rate hitting a six-year high. The Fed preferred price gauge, PCE, rose 2.3% from the year ago, the most in six years.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBHP Board Approves South Flank Project to Replace YandiLaboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, recently collaborated with Royal Philips (PHG  -  Free Report).

2070,MS,"The U.S. Banking sector has cleared the key exam conducted by the Federal Reserve, barring a few. Regulators okayed most of the 35 largest U.S. banks to raise their dividends and buy back shares, reaffirming their ability to endure severe economic crisis.In any case, the Fed’s support to shareholder value maximization has been strong from last year. In 2017, banks that cleared the stress tests were allowed to pay out 100% of their projected net income over the next four quarters, against 65% seen after 2016’s results.Especially, in 2017, Citigroup received an approval of returning nearly 125% of projected earnings over the next four quarters. With this, J.P. Morgan announced its biggest share buyback since the financial crisis last year and Citigroup doubled its dividend (read: De-Stress Your Portfolio by Betting on Bank ETFs).A Vortex of Dividend Hike AnnouncementsSoon after the Fed’s approval this year, the biggest U.S. banks announced plans to repurchase stocks and hike their quarterly dividends. Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) said it would more than double its stock buyback to $24.5 billion and hike its quarterly dividend to 43 cents a share from 39 cents. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) would hike its quarterly dividend by 41% and buy back $17.6 billion of stock over the next year while J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) plans to increase its quarterly dividend to 80 cents from 56 cents a share and repurchase up to $20.7 billion in stock.Shares naturally soared for these companies. However, Deutsche Bank DB failed to get the Fed’s nod to its proposal and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) have been ordered to solidify their balance sheets by putting a cap on dividends and share buybacks.Fed Policy Tightening: Another Tailwind The operating backdrop has been positive for banks currently with the Fed having enacted two rate hikes this year, one in March and the other in June. The Fed is now planning a total of four rate hikes in 2018 citing steady economic growth, quite contrary to previous projections of a total of three increases this year. Since bank stocks perform better in a rising-rate environment, the Fed’s decision should go in their favor (read: Trade, Fed & Oil Wrote Top ETF Stories of 1H).Market Reaction The news boosted the financial sector on Jun 28 and helped the S&P 500 Financials index to snap its “13-day losing streak.” U.S. Financials iShares ETF (IYF) and S&P 500 Financials Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) gained about 0.9% each on Jun 28.ETFs in Focus Investors may be interested in investing in ETFs heavy on J.P.

2071,MS,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) surged on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts raised their price targets for the streaming video powerhouse, both pointing directly to Netflix’s massive growth opportunity in one area.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan analysts both substantially upped their price targets for Netflix on Tuesday, citing international expansion as the primary reason for their heightened optimism. JPMorgan analysts lifted their Netflix price target from $285 per share to $328 per share and reaffirmed their “Overweight” rating.At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target from $275 per share to $350 per share. This would mark a nearly 20% premium compared to Monday’s closing price of $289.93 per share.""We believe Netflix is still in the early stages of global adoption,"" MS analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note to clients. ""While there remains a big opportunity in many of Netflix's older markets, as evidenced by continued strong growth in the U.S., Asia is perhaps the largest untapped opportunity and likely its most challenging one to capture.""Morgan Stanley also predicted that Netflix could see its subscriber numbers hit over 300 million by 2028. But, in order to understand how bullish this new Netflix outlook really is, we have to take a quick look at Netflix’s current subscriber figures and growth estimates.Netflix User Metrics At the end of 2013, Netflix claimed just 44 million total members. Last year, Netflix added 24 million new memberships alone, up from 19 million in 2016. Netflix now boasts over 117 million members in more than 190 countries, but it also faces increased competition in the U.S.A recent CNBC survey found that nearly 60% of Americans already use some type of streaming service, with Netflix the most widely used at 51%, while Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime came in second at 33%.With that said, Netflix has committed billions to original content this year as it fights for users against the likes of Hulu, HBO, and soon enough Disney (DIS  -  Free Report).Q1 Outlook Looking ahead, Netflix’s Q1 earnings are expected to pop by 57.5% to hit $0.63 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, its first quarter revenues are projected to climb by nearly 40% to reach $3.69 billion.But aside from the raw top and bottom line figures, investors should pay close attention to Netflix’s international subscriber growth when the company reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Monday, April 16.For reference, Netflix noted on its fourth-quarter earnings call that it expects to add 1.45 million new members in the U.S. and 4.9 million new international subscribers in Q1.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

On Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to warn Russia of an imminent missile attack on Syria. Trump’s threat follows comments made to the local media by Russia’s ambassador to Lebanon that any American missile launched Syria’s way will be shot down by Russia.Trump tweeted: ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'

2073,MS,"The ongoing two-day FOMC meeting is concluding later today and anticipation surrounding its outcome is sky-high. The Fed is on its way to raise interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2% driven by a strengthening economy and higher inflation. Per CME group, the odds of a June rate hike are 96%. This would also mark the seventh rate hike since December 2015.Additionally, investors are keenly waiting for the Fed’s guidance on the future rate trajectory. Many analysts are expecting four lift-offs compared to the three penciled in for this year, suggesting a faster-than-expected tightening path by the central bank. The minutes from the May meeting also revealed that some policymakers are betting on four rate hikes. This is especially true, as the economy has expanded for nine years and the United States has now entered its second-longest expansion phase since 1785 with unemployment dropping to 3.8%, the lowest level since 2000.Additionally, inflation has been trending above the Fed’s 2% target over the past few months. The latest data showed that it accelerated at the fastest pace in more than six years in May. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in May, bringing the annual inflation (12 months through May) to 2.8% -- the biggest gain since February 2012 and following a 2.5% increase in April.However, many experts caution against the fourth rate hike and expect the Fed to leave its future rate forecast unchanged, thanks to tariff and trade threats that could hamper global growth. A surprise could also be in store as the Fed may signal an early exit from its history-making program to reduce the level of bonds on its balance sheet.Higher interest rates will benefit the financial sector, as it would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers. Accordingly, we have highlighted five stocks that are expected to see smooth trading post the Fed announcement. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), Growth Score of A or B and belongs to the top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 40%).Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report)This Virginia-based preeminent global financial services firm maintains leading market positions in each of its three primary businesses: securities; asset management; and credit services.

2074,MS,"U.S. markets extended their winning run into the fourth straight session on Wednesday. The primary catalyst for gains was bank stocks. This class of equities surged following a rise in U.S. bond yields. Yields closely mirrored the spike in their European counterparts, following indications that the ECB was preparing to wind down its stimulus program.The jump in U.S. bond yields was not unexpected. A spurt in GDP over the next few quarters is likely to raise inflation and consequently interest rates. A spike in rates increases the yield spread for banks, which in turn boosts their margins. Adding banking stocks to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point.Bank Stocks Push Benchmarks Higher The Dow surged 300 points to close above 25,000 for the first time since mid-March. Though The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) 3.2% increase was the primary reason for the blue-chip index’s gains, bank stocks also contributed their part. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) increased by 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively.The S&P 500 also gained 0.9% with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) emerging as the highest gaining sector, increasing 1.9%. Shares of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) increased 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively. Further, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) increased 2.1%, enjoying its best day of gains since Mar 26. European Yields Surge as ECB Hints at End of Stimulus On Wednesday, European bond yields spiked following comments from key ECB officials which indicated the central bank was preparing to wind down its asset purchase in the near term. ECB’s chief economist and board member Peter Praet said the bank will deliberate next week as to how to unravel its monthly bond purchases.Praet mentioned that the “underlying strength” of the Eurozone’s economy was providing him with the confidence to predict that inflation would soon near its targeted level. His hawkish colleague at the ECB and president of Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, said market expectations that bond purchases would cease before the end of the year were “plausible.”Higher Growth to Boost Inflation, Bond YieldsConsequently, U.S. bond yields followed their European counterparts higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 2.98%, marking its highest level since May 24. The increases were not unexpected, given that recent economic data has been more than encouraging. This in turn is likely to boost inflation and consequently, bond yields.Several analysts believe that a 3% pace of growth is already priced into yields. If growth nears 4%, yields are likely to pick up further. This in turn could lead to the Fed raising rates for the fourth time this year. Such an occurrence would not be unwelcome if it takes place against a backdrop of strong growth.Our ChoicesBank stocks have mopped up strong gains whenever yields have moved higher. A spike in European yields was the catalyst on the latest occasion. But domestic factors are also at play and a pickup in growth could spur inflation, boosting yields higher.Adding banking stocks to your portfolio looks like a profitable option at this time. This is because these are likely to benefit from the widening of the yield spread. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

2075,MS,"As part of its strategic efforts to simplify mortgage business, CIT Group Inc. (CIT  -  Free Report) has completed the sale of Financial Freedom and the reverse mortgage portfolio to an undisclosed buyer. With this, the company exited the reverse mortgage operations. The news cheered investors with the company’s shares rising 2.2% following this announcement.Financial Freedom became part of CIT Group when the latter acquired OneWest Bank in August 2015. The unit has been part of the company’s discontinued operation since then.As of Apr 30, 2018, the deal, announced in October 2017, consisted of the sale of mortgage servicing rights and $879 million worth of reverse mortgage whole loans and other real estate owned assets.Additionally, CIT Group has outsourced the payment, servicing and administration of duties of the ongoing mortgage portfolio to a leading national provider of residential servicing. This portfolio was worth roughly $5.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.The ongoing mortgage portfolio includes consumer single family home loans for buying a new property or refinancing an existing one. This is mostly done through both the national CIT Bank direct franchise or through the OneWest Bank branch franchise in Southern California. The company also indirectly originates residential mortgage loans, mainly through a network of correspondent lenders.The Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT Group, Ellen R. Alemany said, “We have addressed another legacy issue by exiting the reverse mortgage business, and we have created greater efficiency in our ongoing mortgage operation by partnering with an industry leader to service our portfolio.”CIT Group remains focused on strengthening its core commercial and consumer operations. As part of this initiative, the company announced a deal to sell its European Rail business in June 2017 while in April 2017 it sold stakes in the joint ventures with Tokyo Century Corporation and divested its aircraft leasing business. Over the last few years, the company has divested its Canadian, Brazilian and Mexican businesses, among others.Driven by these efforts, investors seem to be bullish on the stock. Shares of CIT Group have gained 14.4% in a year’s time, outperforming 9.1% rally for the industry.Currently, CIT Group has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the financial crisis of 2008, other financial institutions including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc.

2076,MS,"Growing trade dispute between the United States and countries around the world have reignited concerns over commerce, economic growth and political stability, unnerving investors. Trump’s anti-trade policies characterized by tariff threats have not only disturbed the nine-year bull run but could also lead to a slowdown in global economic growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, the trade spat has clouded a benign outlook for the global economy, which is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and the next.Amid trade tensions, domestic fundamentals appear sound, compelling investors to remain invested. The U.S. economy has entered its second-longest expansion phase since 1785, thanks to higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence, still-low borrowing cost, growing wages, and a solid job market.In particular, the United States added a robust 223,000 new jobs in May, pushing the unemployment rate to an 18-year low of 3.8%. Consumer spending rose the most in five months in April while consumer confidence rebounded near an 18-year high in May. Meanwhile, manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in May and order backlogs grew the most in 14 years. With this, American manufacturing is enjoying a 21-month long winning streak. So clearly, all the latest data point signal good times for the domestic economy.Further, stronger earnings and the new tax legislation are adding to the bullishness in the market. The massive $1.5-trillion tax cut will perk up the economy and save billions for corporations, boosting job growth and earnings.Given the domestic bullish trends and heightened fears of a trade war, we have highlighted some stock-picking strategies from the top-ranked cohort for investors that could prove extremely beneficial, reducing the risk of a downside:Low-Beta StocksLow-beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Though these have lesser risks and lower returns, the stocks are considered safe and resilient in a choppy market.Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) having beta of 0.12 seems a good bet in this category. Based in Greeley, CO, it is one of the largest chicken companies in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. It has expected earnings growth of 5.19% for this year. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B.Value StocksValue stocks have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets. These stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued. These have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility than their growth and blend counterparts.The Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc (MU  -  Free Report) is one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. It has a Value Score of A and an estimated earnings growth of 132.46% for the fiscal year (ending August 2018). The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Small-Cap StocksSmall-cap stocks have been the leaders this year outperforming the larger ones. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance.The California-based Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR  -  Free Report) could be an intriguing choice given its projected earnings growth of 504.17% for this year. This is an audio technology company that provides various gaming headset solutions for various platforms, including video game and entertainment consoles, handheld consoles, personal computers, and mobile and tablet devices under the Turtle Beach brand. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A.Quality StocksQuality investing also seeks safety and protection against volatility. Quality stocks tend to outperform as these are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth.Based in Luxembourg City, Ternium S.A. (TX  -  Free Report) is the leading producer of flat and long steel products of Latin America and consolidates the operations of the steel companies Hylsa in Mexico, Siderar in Argentina and Sidor in Venezuela. It has a low debt/equity ratio of 0.28, five-year historical EPS growth of 39.39%, an estimated growth rate of 23.47% for sales and 35.92% for earnings this year, and a dividend yield of 3.01%. The stock further belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%), and sports a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A.Dividend StocksThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these world’s — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis.While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Virginia-based Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), having a strong history of dividend growth, seems to be a good pick. The company is a preeminent global financial services firm that maintains leading market positions in each of its three primary businesses: securities; asset management; and credit services. Though the yield is not much high at 1.95%, the stock has five-year historical dividend growth of 43.83% and estimated earnings growth of 31.11%. Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2077,MS,"Over the last four trading days, banking stocks put up a lackluster show. Soft trading revenue outlook provided by some of the major banks hints at a bleak Q2 earnings picture. Additionally, softer loan demand is expected to add to these woes.Further, worries surrounding Italy’s rising debt yields and consequent concerns over the Eurozone’s financial stability are dealing a blow to U.S. bank stocks. The rising political uncertainty has put pressure on the European markets and cast a pall over Euro projects as well. Therefore, increasing demand for safe assets, like the U.S. debt, has brought down the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, triggering losses for banks in the United States.On the other side, the Federal Reserve, along with other key financial regulatory bodies, took another step toward easing the stringent regulations related to the Volcker Rule imposed on banks post 2008 financial crisis. The three-member Federal Reserve Board unanimously approved the proposals aimed at simplifying and improving the Volcker Rule. This might help banks strengthen lending as these firms are likely to benefit from better liquidity position.Nevertheless, coming to company-specific news, litigations and probes pertaining to the past shoddy activities dominated headlines. The law enforcement agencies are also on track, working toward resolving such issues and avoiding lengthy litigations.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the Week Ending May 18, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. At the 2018 Deutsche Bank Eighth Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) hinted at the companies’ Q2 outlook.At the conference, Brian Moynihan — chief executive officer at BofA — stated that the company’s trading income is projected to be flat year over year in the second quarter. However, Moynihan expects things to turn around, depending on the bank’s activities in June.Furthermore, per Wells Fargo’s CFO, John Shrewsberry, the ongoing review process of the bank related to the sales practices issues is ""virtually complete"" and the company has shared all relevant information with investors. Commenting on commercial loan, the bank foresees demand to remain below expectations for 2018, despite anticipated business optimism following the U.S. tax reform.At the same conference, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking — Daniel Pinto — announced the company’s latest outlook for the April-June quarter. “Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,” Pinto said.Meanwhile, concerns have increased for investment bank — Morgan Stanley — thanks to the challenging business conditions in the ongoing quarter, which are affecting its wealth management unit. This unit, particularly, generates half of the bank's revenues. (Read more: Big Banks Forecast Lackluster Q2 Guidance, Muted Trading)2. Wells Fargo has received the judge’s approval for the settlement of $142 million worth class-action lawsuit related to the 3.5 million fake accounts scandal. However, the customers still have scope for filing claims if they feel having been wronged by the bank.The class-action lawsuit was an outcome of the bank’s undue pressure on its employees to achieve extensive sales targets, which led them to open unauthorized savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit from May 2002 to April 2017.The settlement would entertain claims of those clients who have been charged fees on the accounts that were opened without their consent. Also, refunds would be made to customers whose credit scores have been impacted by Wells Fargo’s improper practice and led to higher borrowing costs for them. Lastly, the remaining amount will be distributed equally among the claimants.3. According to Australia’s securities regulator and competition watchdog, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), along with Deutsche Bank AG (DB  -  Free Report) and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., will be sued with criminal charges for alleged “cartel” conduct over the sale of ANZ Bank’s shares worth $1.9 billion in Australia in 2015.In August 2015, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan were the underwriters for the institutional placement of nearly 80.8 million of ANZ Banks’ shares, which was conducted to raise capital in order to meet regulatory requirements.However, there were allegations that the joint underwriters, as part of their underwriting commitment, created a cartel arrangement, and hence reached an understanding for the disposal of 25.5 million shares that they had absorbed as part of the placement. The 25 million shares represented less than 1% of ANZ Bank’s outstanding shares at that time.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: CompanyLast Week6 monthsJPM-3.3%3.4%BAC-3.3%3.9%WFC-1.7%-3.1%C-2.6%-10.9%COF-0.9%3.1%USB-1.1%-8.3%PNC-3.2%3.0%Over the last four trading sessions, JPMorgan and BofA were the major losers, with their shares declining 3.3%.

2078,MS,"With the S&P 500 depreciating around 1.2%, major banks, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), witnessed significant declines in prices on Tuesday. This resulted from the heightening political drama in Italy and Spain, which has spooked investors, creating uproar in global markets. Moreover, the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund (XLF  -  Free Report) — a top bank ETF — declined 3.34%.Particularly, shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman have declined 4.27%, 3.98%, 5.75%, 3.99%, 3.55% and 3.4%, respectively.Worries surrounding Italy’s rising debt yields raised concerns over the stability of Eurozone, dealing a blow to U.S. bank stocks. The rising political uncertainty has put pressure on the European markets and cast a pall over the Euro projects. Therefore, increasing demand for traditional safe assets, like the U.S. debt, has brought down the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, triggering losses for banks in the nation.Further, subdued guidance from some of the Wall Street biggies has also raised investors’ concerns, dragging down banking stocks.Banks’ Outlook At the Deutsche Bank Global Financial Services Conference earlier this week, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking — Daniel Pinto — announced the company’s latest outlook for the second quarter.“Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,” Pinto said. “The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat,” he added.Additionally, though the bank is performing well in rates, commodities and corporate credit business, a quarterly charge of $100 million associated with the tax-oriented investment unit of its fixed income division is expected to be recorded, Pinto added. Moreover, investment banking business momentum is likely to continue.Similarly, Alastair Borthwick, head of BofA’s global corporate banking, came up with the bank’s lending demand outlook for the current year. Per Borthwick, though companies are “more optimistic about the economy,” BofA believes it is still too early to forecast the lending outlook.Strong economy indicates spur in loan growth, but lower U.S. tax rates has already helped earning extra income which refrains the company from providing the lending demand outlook, per Borthwick.Meanwhile, investment bank — Morgan Stanley — tanked on concerns over challenging business conditions in the second quarter, which are affecting its wealth management unit. Notably, this unit generates half of the bank's revenues.Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, noted during the conference that prevalent slower client activity in April and May, as well as March, has dampened Morgan Stanley’s retail transaction revenues.Furthermore, pricing of fee-based accounts is related to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter. At the end of Q1, the market was tumbling, resulting in low pricing of these accounts, thereby negatively impacting Morgan Stanley.ConclusionThe January-March quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes, on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. In addition, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports thwarted the stock market rally in Q1.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appeared that volatility was back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicated higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Nonetheless, banks are skeptical for the second quarter on global market turmoil and uncertainty of markets on the ongoing developments, including easing of regulations.Among the above-mentioned stocks, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BofA, Goldman and JPMorgan currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

2079,MS,"Tuesday marks the first day that music streaming powerhouse Spotify plans to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify's relatively unique direct listing could make today a very interesting one for this much-anticipated tech IPO. Here’s what we know so far.Spotify is one of the world’s most popular music streaming services, competing directly against the likes of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Music and others. The firm has raised billions of dollars in private funding over the years and currently makes roughly 90% of its money from premium customers, who pay monthly fees to stream unlimited music (also read: 3 Facts Investors Must Know Ahead of Spotify's Unique IPO).Reference PriceSpotify's reference price is set at $132 by the NYSE, which would put the company’s initial value at roughly $23.5 billion. The reference price isn’t exactly what shareholders will pay, nor is it an official offering price. Citadel Securities and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) will use this price and analyze initial buy and sell orders in order to put together an opening price for the stock. The two investment firms are not traditional underwriters but will assist the Sweden-based music firm’s listing in a less overarching capacity.Spotify will begin trading at a price that designated market makers believe buy and sell orders can be matched at a specific, set level.The company’s direct listing could also lead to greater volatility than a traditional IPO because there are no large investors getting in on the stock at a premium price early on. Furthermore, unlike most listings, current Spotify shareholders can sell their shares on the opening day, with the potential to make a killing.Spotify’s listing is one of the most anticipated tech IPO’s since Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). The company has also become a household name in this modern on-demand economy. However, the streaming music giant is going public at a volatile time for the market and technology stocks in particular.Make sure to check back here for more on Spotify’s first day on the NYSE!*A previous version of this article mentioned that Citadel is helping price and make a market for Spotify’s IPO. This has been corrected to Citadel Securities, which is a separate firm that is acting as the designated market maker *The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2081,MS,"Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) chief executive officer (CEO) — Tim Sloan — received about 36% pay hike in his total compensation package for 2017. His annual salary has been increased to $17.4 million in the year from $12.8 million in 2016, according to a proxy filing.The CEO’s package includes a salary of $2.4 million as base pay and restricted stock worth $15 million. Per the filing, Sloan has not been awarded cash bonus on his recommendations based on Wells Fargo’s “significant but incomplete progress on addressing compliance and operational risk-management issues.”Notably, 2017 was the first full year as CEO for Sloan. He succeeded John Stumpf in October 2016, when Stumpf stepped down in the wake of public and political outrage concerning the sales scam which surfaced in September 2016 related to 3.5 million accounts.For months, the banking giant has been caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices. It is more than a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $190 million, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring.Further, the Federal Reserve’s recent action of restricting the bank’s asset growth underlines poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees. Notably, it is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve. However, the bank is allowed to continue with its current banking activities.In the filing, Sloan’s pay package was justified with the fact that the company is performing well under the reign of the present CEO and that the compensation is well deserved. In 2017, Wells Fargo notched a profit of $22.2 billion, up 1.4% from 2016.Notably, the company's share price appreciated roughly 10.6% in 2017, underperforming 19.3% growth registered by the industry, following a slight decline in 2016.Among other banking giants, Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) chairman as well as CEO — Brian Moynihan — is expected to receive $23 million as total compensation for 2017, which reflects a rise of 15% year over year. Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) CEO — Michael Corbat — received about 48% pay hike in his total compensation package. In addition, JPMorgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) increased the CEOs’ compensation.While the current crisis at Wells Fargo will take some time to alleviate, the company’s solid capital position, growing loans and deposits, and improving credit quality position it well for growth. We believe, over the long term, Wells Fargo will remain comfortably positioned to benefit from a recovering economy, given its diverse geographic mix. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions and restructuring moves will likely help the company expand its business and improve profitability.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2082,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is planning to enhance its workforce in Paris by adding about 80 jobs, post-Brexit.

The news was reported first by Les Echos, a French newspaper.The bank has chosen Frankfurt as the hub for its broker-dealer business whereas its asset management business will be shifted to Dublin, inside the European Union (EU). As Britain is likely to lose the “passporting rights” post-Brexit, which enable international banks to open branches and conduct business easily in any part of the European territory after the initial process of registration is over, the banks have been busy carrying out contingency plans.Per the person, around 200 jobs will be moving to Frankfurt out of the 300 which are likely to be transferred to different cities spread across Europe.Earlier in March, UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report) assured job safety to some of its employees who would be affected by the shifting of the base to Frankfurt from London on account of Brexit. The company plans to shift employees by using a decentralized approach.Other banks have also made contingency plan to be executed post-Brexit.Notably, Japan’s Nomura Holdings, Inc.

2083,MS,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is transforming into a major threat to the wealth management industry based on its Sumerian virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platform, Artificial Intelligence (AI) expertise and trove of consumer data & spending patterns.The company in collaboration with Fidelity Labs recently created a digital financial advisor Cora that people interacted with using a VR headset.Amazon plans to lure enterprises in utilizing its VR/AR tools to develop company specific apps. The recent VR demonstration reflected its technological capability, which enhances the possibility of entering into the investment advisory and consulting field, and eventually financial services domain.The company has been looking for ways to enter the financial services to continue its growth momentum. Amazon’s scintillating growth over the last decade can be attributed to its capability of disrupting retail, grocery and cloud computing market. Shares have returned 1921.1% over the period, significantly outperforming S&P 500’s gain of 113.4%.  The company has also shown active interest in providing healthcare services. Amazon has teamed up with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) to create a non-profit organization to address the needs of their U.S.-based employees.Wealth Management Totters from AI ThreatInvestment advisory and consulting functions are important because these facilitates cross-selling of different financial products under wealth management domain. Penetrating into this field should ultimately help Amazon to expand its financial services offerings in the long haul.Amazon’s foray into the wealth management market doesn’t bode well for wealth managers and consultants. They are already under tremendous pressure due to rapid evolution of AI and tools like machine learning, which has been promulgating roboadvisors (automated investment solutions). Business Insider Intelligence estimates that 10% of all global assets, or $8 trillion, will be managed by robos by 2020, significantly up from $200 billion in 2016.Leading asset managers and banking firms like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo WFS are already using roboadvisors. Blackrock, the largest fund manager in the world has been using machines and algorithms to pick stocks for its actively managed funds.Overstock (OSTK  -  Free Report), an e-commerce provider, with almost 40 million active users has already rolled out a roboadvisor supported by tZERO Advisors.Amazon’s Data Trove & Popularity Provides an EdgeNevertheless, Amazon’s entry is especially threatening given the trove of information it has about consumers and their spending habits. The company has the ability to harness AI, machine learning tools and the Sumerian platform to offer customized wealth management products based on this data.Although this is quite a far-fetched thought, if it clicks with people, a digital investment advisor from Amazon may send jitters across wealth management firms. Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Notably, Amazon’s digital assistant Alexa has the ability to answer economic questions thanks to a partnership with UBS Wealth Management. The company has been focusing on expanding fintech services to provide more facilities to Prime members, which is now more than 100 million.Reportedly, Amazon has already held discussions with several large banks, including JP Morgan, to launch a checking-account like product primarily for underserved customers and millennials. A checking account would help it to provide further benefits to Prime members, persuading them to buy more on Amazon’s e-commerce platform.Moreover, the millennial focus is significant. Per comScore's 2017 US Mobile App Report, Amazon App is more popular among millennials (aged 18-34) compared with Gmail and Facebook.Notably, millennials as prospective customers hold most potential for any wealth management firm due to their need for retirement savings. They are also more likely to switch investment advisors as compared with older investors. According A.T. Kearney, in 2017, “53% of mass affluent investors aged 18 to 24 switched primary investment firms.”Moreover, per consulting firm Bain, 75% of responding millennials in a recent survey stated that they are likely to test a technology firm’s deposit account, credit card and other products.Hence, Amazon’s popularity gives it an edge in this regard over legacy financial services providers.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2084,MS,"On Wednesday, at the 2018 Deutsche Bank Eighth Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) hinted at the companies’ Q2 outlook.At the conference, Brian Moynihan — chief executive officer at BofA — stated that the company’s trading income is projected to be flat year over year in the second quarter, however things might turn around, depending on activities in June. Furthermore, the bank is likely to continue to benefit from disposing excess capital using share buybacks.Further, per Wells Fargo’s CFO John Shrewsberry, the ongoing review process of the bank related to the sales practices issues is ""virtually complete"" and the company has shared all relevant information with investors.""I don't think at this point that there's anything meaningful that we aren't already talking about,"" Shrewsberry said at the conference. Overall, the bank has succeeded in maintaining established customers, ""we haven't sold or deepened relationships as rapidly as we thought we would in terms of a recovery,"" Shrewsberry added.Commenting on commercial loan, the bank foresees demand to remain below expectations for 2018, despite anticipated business optimism following the U.S. tax reform.At the same conference on Tuesday, JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) head of corporate and investment banking — Daniel Pinto — announced the company’s latest outlook for the second quarter.“Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,” Pinto said. “The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat,” Pinto had noted.Additionally, though the bank is performing well in rates, commodities and corporate credit business, a quarterly charge of $100 million associated with the tax-oriented investment unit of its fixed income division will likely be recorded, Pinto had mentioned further. Moreover, investment banking business momentum is likely to continue.Meanwhile, concerns increased for investment bank — Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) — over challenging business conditions in the ongoing quarter, which are affecting its wealth management unit. This unit, particularly, generates half of the bank's revenues.During the conference, Andy Saperstein, co-head of the bank's wealth management division, stated that sluggish client activity in the months of March, April and May, has dampened Morgan Stanley’s retail transaction revenues.Furthermore, pricing of fee-based accounts is related to market prices on the last day of the previous quarter. The market was tumbling at the end of Q1, giving rise to low pricing of those accounts, thereby, hitting Morgan Stanley’s performance.ConclusionThe January-March quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes, on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks, since last September, to some extent. In addition, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports thwarted the stock market rally in Q1.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appeared that volatility was back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicated higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Nonetheless, banks are skeptical for the second quarter on global market turmoil and uncertainty of markets on the ongoing developments, including easing of regulations.Notably, shares of BofA and JPMorgan inched up 4.9% and 3.4%, respectively, while shares of Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley declined 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively, over the last six months. Among the above-mentioned stocks, Wells Fargo, BofA and JPMorgan currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

2085,MS,"U.S. stock markets closed significantly lower on Tuesday as a result of political turmoil in two major Eurozone countries, Italy and Spain. All three major indexes entered into negative territory as soon the markets opened after Memorial Day weekend and failed to recover at the closing bell. Banking stocks bore the brunt of the impact. Moreover, the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China is displaying no signs of ebbing, fanning investors’ apprehensions of a full-blown trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,361.45, decreasing 1.6% or 391.64 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also fell 1.2% to close at 2,689.86. Likewise, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,396.59, declining 0.5%. A total of 7.58 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.58 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.49 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.63 to -1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX surged 28.7% to close at 17.02. During trading on Tuesday, Wall Street’s fear gauge once touched 18.68, its highest in two months.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow lost 1.6% marking its third straight negative session. Notably, 27 of the 30-stocks in the blue-chip index closed in the red while two traded in the green. The Dow suffered its worst day on a percentage basis since Apr 24. A loss of 391.64 points once again placed the blue-chip index in negative territory year to date.The S&P 500 decreased 1.2%, marking its third straight negative session, owing to 3.3% drop of the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), 1.8% decline in Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) and 1.6% decrease in Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. Like the Dow, S&P 500 also suffered its worst day on a percentage basis since Apr 24.Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5% due to abroad-based market decline.Political Turmoil in EurozonePolitical crisis in Italy has created ripples across the global equity markets. The crisis arose after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of economy minister Paolo Savona a known critic of the European Union and European integration.Notably, Savona was recommended by a coalition of the populist 5 Star Movement and the League. Party leaders from 5 Star demanded Mattarella’s impeachment, per the Wall Street Journal. Collapse of a populist coalition raised concerns of an early election in the country, while short-term borrowing costs soared for the government in Rome.Meanwhile, markets were also rattled by the political turmoil in Spain. In an effort to oust Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s major opposition party has called for a parliamentary vote. This demand can be attributed to a court ruling which stated that the ruling party benefited from an illegal kickback when the country was undergoing a property boom.The political crisis in Europe and the apparent threat to the Euro project triggered a panic alarm. Investors rush to traditional safe havens like U.S. debt, dragging down U.S. 10-year bond yields to 2.77 from its highest of 3.1 recently. As a result, U.S. banks suffered. Furthermore, the Euro fell below $1.16 per dollar, its lowest this year. Consequently, the Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.68% Tuesday at 94.83.Major banks like Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chess & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report)  lost 5.8%, 4.3%, 4%, 4% and 3.4%, respectively. The corporate and investment bank chief of JPMorgan indicated that the bank's second-quarter markets revenue would be flat compared with a year earlier. Moreover, the co-head of Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hinted slower activity since March.Except for Morgan Stanley, all four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trade Conflicts LingerOn Tuesday, the Trump administration stated that it will continue to take action on trade with China despite the fact that the two countries are engaged in high-level talks to defuse trade tensions. The United States will also continue to pursue litigation against China at the World Trade Organization. In a recent press release, the White House stated that the U.S. government is likely to release a list of $50 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be subject to a 25% tariff.Economic DataOn May 29, the Conference Board reported U.S. consumer confidence data for the month of May. The consumer confidence index for May is pegged at 128.0 compared with April’s revised reading of 125.6. May’s reading was also slightly better than the consensus estimate of 127.8. The Present Situation index, reflecting current conditions, reached at a 17-year high of 161.7 from 157.5 in the prior month. The Expectations index also increased to 105.6 from 104.3 in April.Stocks That Made HeadlinesGap Q1 Earnings Miss Hits Stock, Revenues Top EstimatesShares of The Gap Inc.

2089,MS,"Markets witnessed a steep decline on Thursday after Trump slapped China with annual tariffs worth billions of dollars. Three major indexes declined to their lowest levels since Feb 8. Further, financial shares plummeted to their lowest level in six weeks. Meanwhile, the CBOE VIX surged more than 30% after markets were gripped with fears of a trade war.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 2.9% to close at 23,957.89. The S&P 500 lost 2.5% to close at 2,643.69. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,166.68, decreasing 2.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 34.6% to close at 24.04. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.50-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.U.S. Imposes $60 Billion in Annual Tariffs on ChinaPresident Trump signed a bill on Thursday, the purpose of which is to impose $60 billion in annual tariffs on China. Citing China’s ‘unfair’ trade practices as the primary reason behind such levies, Trump also stated that this would be the “first of many"" such actions that he intends to take against China.These so called ‘protectionist’ measures are actually aimed at castigating China for practices which Trump believes helps China ‘steal American intellectual property.’ Targeted products include those from the technology sector where Trump believes China holds an advantage over the United States. Such areas include robotics, artificial intelligence and advanced wireless computers.The newest measures would be a part of the 301 investigation headed by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The body would probe into China’s unfair trade practices and would publish a list of targeted products within 15 days. Officials from the administration also stated that the list would include some 1,300 product lines.CBOE VIX on a TearPost the resurgence of trade fears, the fear-gauge of the market — the CBOE Volatility index skyrocketed 31% to hit 23.35, finally settling at 24.04 on Thursday. The VIX has more than doubled so far this year.Current weakness in the technology sector as well as the sell-off which ensued post Trump’s imposition of levies on China, triggered widespread frenzy in the markets and led to a surge in VIX.

2090,MS,"Morgan Stanley Investment Management, a unit of Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), has successfully completed the acquisition of Los Angeles, CA-based commercial real estate credit platform, Mesa West Capital, LLC.Mesa West is a leading, originations-focused, commercial real estate credit platform that has originated 250 loans since its inception in 2004, totaling $12 billion in principal balance.Its acquisition adds $5 billion in assets under management (AUM) to Morgan Stanley’s Investment Management unit and nearly 7% to the company’s overall revenues.Morgan Stanley’s Investment Management wing will now be able to offer real estate credit that was previously unavailable.Notably, Mesa West’s employees will continue to work from its offices in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, and Mesa West itself will operate as a separate entity within Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Real Assets group.Also, Mesa West’s current management team, led by Co-Founders Jeff Friedman and Mark Zytko, will continue to manage the company on a day-to-day basis.With an aim to lower balance-sheet risk and focus on its two less capital intensive businesses -- Wealth Management and Investment Management, Morgan Stanley has been taking several restructuring initiatives over the past few years.

2091,MS,"Per a Reuters report, the Association of the Foreign Banks in Germany (VAB) expects that post Brexit, nearly 20 Britain-based banks will expand operations in Germany, as part of their plans to shift base for their European operations out of London.Stefan Winter, the head of VAB, said, “This will involve up to 5,000 new jobs (in Germany) in the next two years, many of which will be hired locally.”Till now, most Britain banks had their operations based at London, which is the region’s biggest financial center. However, now as Britain decides to leave the European Union (EU), these banks will potentially lose their “passporting rights,” which enabled them to open branches and conduct business easily in any part of the European territory.Thus, these banks have started looking for possible options to base their operations as part of their contingency plans. While some of the banks have already set up offices in the EU or moved staff, others are yet to come up with their final decisions.As of now, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin have emerged as the potential choices of banks. There is a sort of rivalry that has started amongst these cities, and each one of these is seeking to attract banks and staff from London.  Notably, as part of the French labor reforms, Paris President Emmanuel Macron took measures to lower taxes and cut red tape for international bankers. While this move has appealed to banks like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Frankfurt, which is home to the European Central Bank has been a preferred choice of most of the other companies like Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) for base establishment of European operations.In fact, the VAB expects majority of the jobs to shift to Frankfurt next year. Winter stated that he expects Frankfurt-based banks’ total assets to increase to almost €800 billion over the long term.However, according to a person familiar with the matter, it is less likely that all the people who are currently working in their respective London offices will be the ones who will move to Frankfurt. The person noted, “Only 20 to 30 percent will actually relocate from London to Frankfurt, the reluctance to moving is quite high.”Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2092,MS,"With the S&P 500 rising just around 2% year to date, major banks, including JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), have witnessed significant price performance. Shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Morgan Stanley and Goldman have spiked 7.3%, 9%, 8.4% and 4.2%, respectively, year to date. However, shares of Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined slightly.Notably, low client activities and less volatility across capital markets, which resulted in weak trading revenues for banks in 2017, are expected to rebound this year. Rising volatility at the very beginning of 2018 is expected to break the trading revenues slump.Banks’ OutlookAt the RBC Capital Markets 2018 Financial Institutions Conference earlier this week, Citigroup’s chief financial officer — John Gerspach — announced the company’s latest outlook for the first quarter. The bank expects first-quarter 2018 trading revenues to be up by a ""low-to-mid"" single digit on a year-over-year basis.The bank expects equities business to record revenues more than $1 billion in Q1, last recorded in 2015. However, management believes investment banking might go down as compared with the prior-year quarter.Moreover, focused on digitization, this banking giant aims to launch a national digital consumer bank over the next three years. “I am not making an announcement right now, but I would be really disappointed if it was anything close to being three years away,” CFO John Gerspach said at the investor conference. “We really are laying the groundwork for having a national digital bank,” he further added.Similarly, last week, at the annual Investors’ Day conference, JPMorgan’s management discussed the current macroeconomic backdrop and the path the company is taking to enhance profitability over the medium term, which also included the first-quarter trading outlook.Management projects first-quarter market revenues to increase in mid-to-high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis, based on the market conditions. Further, investment banking is anticipated to remain stable or be up slightly year over year.Notably, both banks hinted at rebound in trading activities, particularly due to solid revenues in foreign exchange, emerging markets and equities trading.ConclusionLast year, despite several political and geopolitical developments, and hike in interest rates, which could have incited volatility, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of specific catalysts, have been a drag on volatility.Nonetheless, this dismal operating backdrop seems to have ended with the increased volatility recorded year to date on strong gains in emerging markets and equities benefiting banks’ financials.Among the above-mentioned stocks, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while BofA, JPMorgan and Goldman have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2093,MS,"Kelly Stuart King, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), received a total of $12.67 million as annual compensation for 2017. The payout amount, disclosed by the bank in a regulatory filing, reflects a 9.1% rise on a year-over-year basis.King’s base salary for the year remained unchanged at $1.075 million. Thus, the rise in his total compensation was through stock grants.This is because, in February 2017, the company’s board of directors made changes in executive compensation scheme, wherein it was decided that the base salary of the company’s top 4 executives will remain unchanged for 2017 and any increase in compensation will, hence, be given through stock awards.Thus, the 2017 base salary of Christopher L. Henson, BB&T’s president and chief operating officer (COO) also remained unchanged at $700,000. The stock awards granted to him for the year were increased to $1.5 million from $863,971 in 2016, raising his total compensation for 2017 by 24.6% to $7.19 million.Among other finance companies, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) also increased their CEO’s compensation.Notably, the compensation hikes for BB&T comes after the company delivered strong fourth-quarter as well as full-year 2017 results. Higher rates and loan growth drove the company’s revenues, which aided earnings growth to quite an extent.While higher expenses might hurt BB&T’s bottom-line growth to some extent, the company’s continuous expansion via acquisitions and lower tax rates are likely to aid profitability in the quarters ahead.In fact, with an aim to pass on the benefits from the tax reforms to the shareholders, BB&T also announced a 13.6% dividend hike and a one-time dividend of 4.5 cents per share. This, along with other capital deployment activities, is expected to continue boosting shareholder confidence in the stock.Shares of the company gained 5.8% in 2017, underperforming the 18.9% rally of the industry.BB&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2094,MS,"Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) have lost more than 2% over the last three months amid industry-wide volatility and legal issues, underperforming the industry’s rally of 4.3%.While this San Francisco, CA-based banking giant recorded growing deposits and loan balances over the past few years, displayed a strong capital position and remained focused on undertaking strategic acquisitions, the ongoing litigation issues have primarily challenged its profitability.Troubles have been mounting for Wells Fargo, following the revelation of opening of millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. ‘Cross-selling’, which has been the company’s key strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of employees of the bank had unlawfully enrolled consumers in products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting sales targets. Though the bank is taking necessary steps to address the issue, it undoubtedly keeps the company’s financials under pressure.In addition to the above, persistent rise in operating expenses over the last few quarters  is another concern for Wells Fargo. The company remains focused on expense management with the target of eliminating $4 billion of expenses by 2019. Nevertheless, we believe its bottom line will continue to be affected in the near term on legal expenses related to the above-mentioned sales scam and other litigation issues.Additionally, Wells Fargo’s high debt burden remains another headwind. The company has debt-to-equity ratio of 1.23 compared with the industry average of 0.91. It underlines the financial instability of the company in a turbulent economic environment.Further, Wells Fargo’s quarterly dividend payment might not be sustainable as its earnings have been volatile for the last several quarters. Also, given the bank’s high debt level and above-industry dividend payout ratio, continuation of dividend payout is doubtful which is disadvantageous for value investors.Moreover, Wells Fargo has been witnessing downward earnings estimate revisions for the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down slightly to $4.72 for 2018. For 2019, it edged down around 1% to $5.26 during the same timeframe.With Wells Fargo currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Value Score of C, we don’t see it as an attractive investment option. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Investing in large cap stocks is often perceived as a safe strategy to stay afloat amid market turmoil.

2095,MS,"Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) Chief Executive Officer, Brian T. Moynihan receives a 15% hike in his total compensation for 2017. The company, on Friday, stated in a regulatory filing that its board of directors has approved Moynihan’s 2017 incentive plan.Moynihan received a total compensation of $23 million for 2017, increasing from $20 million that he received in 2016.Of the total compensation, $21.5 million is in the form of stock grants. This equity incentive marks an increase from $18.5 million paid in 2016.The remaining $1.5 million is his annual salary, which remained unchanged. Also, he did not receive any cash bonus for the year.Notably, of the total equity incentive that the company provides, half is performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs), which are paid only if the company meets certain financial goals. The remaining half is time-based RSUs and does not vary with the performance of the company.Among others, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also increased their CEO’s compensation.Notably, the compensation hike for BofA comes after the company delivered strong fourth-quarter as well as full-year 2017 results. Its results benefited from net interest income growth, primarily driven by higher rates and loan growth, along with improvement in investment banking fees.The bank’s efforts to streamline and simplify operations are expected to support its overall growth. Also, gains from the new tax act will likely aid its financial performance, going forward.Shares of the company gained 33.6% in 2017, outperforming 18.9% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2096,MS,"The Swiss bank —  UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) — has expressed interest in increasing majority stake in its Chinese securities venture with the submission of application to China’s securities regulator — The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Bloomberg reported. This moves follows CSRC’s lessening restrictions on foreign ownership of brokerages announced earlier this year.Notably, indicating their readiness to allow greater access to global banks into their financial markets, the securities regulator has set the month of June as deadline for foreign companies to increase majority stake to 51% in securities JVs, up from the existing ceiling of 49%. Regarding this, the CSRC detailed the guidelines and experience mandatory for foreign shareholders, last week, along with the scale of businesses which can be recognized.Therefore, to explore opportunities for its investment banking, wealth and asset management operations in China, this Zurich-based bank targets to raise stake to 51%, up from the existing 24.99%.ConclusionGlobal investment banks’ expansion has been limited in China for the past few years due to restrictions imposed on ownerships. Therefore, with the easing out of boundaries for global banks and the growing Chinese economy, major foreign banks will be attracted to expand here.

2097,MS,"Markets finished lower on Friday, as technology stocks took a hit owing to concerns of weak demand for iPhones. Also, the broader consumer staples sector took a hit led by Pepsi and Procter& Gamble. Moreover, a rise in bond yields, reflecting fears of rising inflation, kept investors worried. The 10-year Treasury note touched a four-year high leading to huge selloffs. Following these events, all the major indexes closing lower on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.8%, to close at 24,462.94. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% to close at 2,670.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7146.13, shedding 1.3%. A total of 6.45 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.92 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow declined 201.95 points as shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) tumbled on concerns of weak demand for iPhones, leading to a decline in all tech stocks. Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) declined 1.1%, while Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1%, respectively. Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) declined 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 7146.13 points.Tech Stocks, Consumer Staples Take a HitTech stocks declined on Friday, with Apple at the helm of the carnage, as concerns over weak demand of iPhones saw the company’s shares plummeting. Shares of Apple declined 4.1% after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) predicted that sales of iPhone in the June quarter will be low.This saw other tech stocks taking a hit for the fourth consecutive day ahead of the earnings week for the sector. Tech stocks have been reeling under pressure for quite some time now and the low sales projection of iPhones is a further blow to the sector.Moreover, consumer staples stocks declined led by PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), which fell 2.9%. Also, shares of Procter & Gamble and Phillip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) declined 2.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Procter and Gamble’s shares declined after the company said on Thursday that higher costs and shrinking retailer inventories were weighing on its margins. Shares of Philip Morris declined after the company reported weak shipment volumes in its quarterly results.10-Year Treasury Note Hits 4-Year HighFriday’s decline in stocks were also driven by investors’ fears over concerns of expectations of rising inflation., The 10-year Treasury yield reached 2.96%, its highest level since January 2014. This saw huge selloffs in bonds. Investors panicked as they felt that the government’s protectionist policy will boost inflation higher. However, banks stocks gained on the back of higher rates. This saw the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gain 0.1%.Weekly RoundupIt was a mixed week for all the three major indexes as the earnings season got into full swing. U.S. stock markets surged on the first two day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results, strong economic data and easing geopolitical tensions. The middle of the week was a mixed bag for the markets with the Dow declining marginally.However, the last two days of the week saw all major indexes ending in red. This was primarily because of concerns over rising inflation, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield touching a four year high. Moreover, consumer staples stocks too suffered, as earnings failed to produce any blowout results that the market was looking for. The tech sector was once again hit after Morgan Stanley said that iPhones would witness sales in the June quarter.However, despite this, both Dow and S&P 500 rose 0.4% each over the week, while Nasdaq gained 1.3%.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKansas City Southern Q1 Earnings Miss, Improve Y/YKansas City Southern’s (KSU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2098,MS,"Shares of eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) have climbed 23% over the last year, and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) analysts just recently “double upgraded” the stock. With that said, investors must still consider how eBay is expected to perform in the first quarter, as Q1 will likely have a greater impact on eBay’s near-term price movement than Morgan Stanley’s positive long-term outlook.Morgan Stanley analysts raised their eBay rating to “overweight” all the up way from “underweight.” The investment bank also up its price target from $36 per share to $58 a share, which marks a nearly 40% premium compared to eBay’s closing price on Wednesday.The reason for this substantial upgrade centers on the fact that eBay, which split from PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) a few years ago, will finally start to transition away from the online payment platform—with a full transition expected by mid-2020. “EBay acting as both marketplace and payment intermediator could simplify and reduce costs for merchants, who would pay a single fee to eBay,” analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients.However, eBay’s recent upgrade and year-long momentum don’t mean investors should consider buying the stock ahead of its Q1 earnings report.Therefore, we have to look at what to expect from eBay’s first quarter earnings results to let investors decide if they want to buy eBay stock in order to take home some possible near-term gains.Latest Outlook & ValuationEBay’s Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 17.2% to reach $2.6 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s EPS figure is expected to expand by 8.2% to reach $0.53 per share.It is also worth noting that eBay has experienced nothing but positive Q1 earnings estimate revision activity recently.Of course, revenue and earnings growth estimates are just two of the many metrics investors will consider when eBay reports its first quarter financial results.Heading into Thursday, eBay was trading with a Forward P/E of 21.9, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet - Commerce” industry’s average of 49.7. Investors should be excited to see that eBay offers such great value, especially compared to its industry, for a company that is expected to experience big Q1 revenue growth.  EBay has also consistently traded at this earnings multiple over the last year, while its stock price has climbed. This signals that eBay’s earnings estimates have also continually climbed higher over this period.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance eBay has to surprise with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Ebay is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.31%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.54 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Therefore, investors can consider eBay a stock that looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Wednesday, April 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2099,MS,"Wednesday, April 18, 2018Triple-digit gains in regular-day Tuesday trading in both the Dow and Nasdaq were bolstered by a number of different things — strong housing starts and a lack of relative geopolitical tension early this week among them — but nothing so influential as a very strong Q1 earnings season. We are still in the early stages so far (only a week has passed since Delta Air Lines beat estimates on both top and bottom lines), but overall results have been notably better than expected.While after-the-bell earnings reports yesterday were better than expected across the board, some companies performed more impressively than others. While Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted a robust earnings beat, IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) eked out a positive surprise on new corporate tax benefits alone. (IBM’s Watson enterprise has thus far failed to inspire fresh investment in Big Blue.) As a result, IBM has shed more than 5% in today’s pre-market, while ISRG shares are up 5% this morning.New Q1 earnings reports are following suit, starting with Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which left estimates in the dust this morning. This investment banking major posted $1.45 per share on $11.1 billion in quarterly revenues, outpacing the $1.28 and $10.5 billion in the Zacks consensus estimates, respectively. Net income grew 38% in Q1, whereas Sales & Trading rose 26%.

This still represents good year-over-year growth from $5.29 billion in Q1 2017, but pre-market trading shows USB shares slipping half a percentage point at this hour. For more on USB’s earnings, click here.Based on Chicago’s North Shore, Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) also topped earnings consensus by a penny to 59 cents per share. Revenues also slightly surpassed expectations in Q1, reporting $7.39 billion in sales. Guidance for full-year 2018 has been posted at between $2.80 and $2.90 per share, and the Zacks consensus is roughly at the midpoint. Shares are off 1.3% ahead of today’s opening bell. For more on ABT’s earnings, click here.Defense components major Textron (TXT  -  Free Report), however, performed much better this morning — 76 cents per share blew away expectations of 46 cents, and more than double the 37 cents per share a year ago. Sales of $3,296 million also impressed, both above the estimated $3,114 million and the year-ago figure of $3,093 million. Industrial sales perked up 14%, and the company saw gains from its Arctic Cat acquisition. Shares are up 6.7% in today’s pre-market.

2100,MS,"Trading rebound, higher interest income and improvement in advisory fees drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.45 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. The reported figure was 45% above the prior-year quarter.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained more than 2.5% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with its solid trading revenues and a decent investment banking   performance. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.As expected, both equity trading income (up 27%) and fixed income, currency and commodities income (up 8%) supported revenue growth. Further, equity underwriting fees (up 8%), advisory income (up 16%) and net interest income acted as tailwinds. Also, the company’s capital ratios remained strong.However, lower debt underwriting fees (down 2%) was an undermining factor. Moreover, operating expenses recorded a rise.Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $2.7 billion, up 38% year over year.Rise in Trading Income Aids Revenues, Costs RiseNet revenues amounted to $11.1 billion, a rise of 14% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.5 billion.Net interest income was $975 million, jumping 26% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely driven by a rise in interest income.Also, total non-interest revenues of $10.1 billion grew 13% year over year, primarily supported by improvement in trading.Total non-interest expenses were $7.7 billion, up 10% year over year.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $2.1 billion, increasing 22% year over year. Net revenues of $6.1 billion grew 18% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly driven by higher trading income, advisory revenues and equity underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower debt underwriting income.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations totaled $1.2 billion, up 19% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenues were $4.4 billion, increasing 8% from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher asset management fee revenues and net interest income, partly offset by a decline in transactional revenues.Investment Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $148 million, surging 44% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenues were $718 million, a rise of 18% year over year. The increase reflected higher asset management fees, partly offset by fall in investment revenues.As of Mar 31, 2018, total assets under management or supervision were $469 billion, up 11% on a year-over-year basis.Strong Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, book value per share was $39.19, up from $37.48 as of Mar 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share was $34.04, up from $32.49 as of Mar 31, 2017.Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 capital ratio Advanced (Fully Phased-in) was 18.4% compared with 19.0% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 common equity ratio Advanced (Fully Phased-in) was 16.1% compared with 16.6% in the prior-year quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley bought back around 22 million shares for nearly $1.25 billion. This was part of the company's 2017 capital plan.Our TakeMorgan Stanley’s initiatives to offload its non-core assets to lower balance-sheet risks and shift focus on less capital-incentive operations like wealth management are commendable. Further, rebound in trading activities will likely support top-line growth.However, dismal investment banking performance is a concern. This is expected to have an adverse impact on the company’s revenues.Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteMorgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2101,MS,"Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to offer shares of its asset management business — DWS Group — at a price range of €30 to €36 per share. The shares are due to begin trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Mar 23.Deutsche Bank plans to sell 20% of its wholly owned shares in DWS. Further, it reserves the right to offer another 5% in case of strong demand and to cover over-allotments.The Japan-based Nippon Life Insurance Co. has agreed to become a ""cornerstone"" investor in the offering and would be acquiring 5% stake in the unit at the issue price. Also, a representative of Nippon Life would become member of the supervisory board of DWS. Moreover, they have entered into a five-year strategic partnership, under which additional assets under management (AUM) will be added under the DWS name.The minority initial public offering (IPO) is expected to raise proceeds between €1.5 billion and €1.8 billion, which is lower thanwhat Deutsche Bank had hoped for.Deutsche Bank is global coordinator on the IPO, with Barclays plc (BCS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse (CS  -  Free Report), BNP Paribas, ING, Citigroup, UBS Group and UniCredit as bookrunners.Last week, at an event in Texas, CEO John Cryan announced that the bank’s top executives would have to forgo bonus this year. On the other hand, overall employee bonuses for 2017 would be considerably higher compared with the prior year.  With about €700 billion in AUM, listing of DWS might help Cryan to turnaround the bank’s fate. Also, it is likely to bolster the bank’s capital position. Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank’s bottom line continues to remain under pressure due to low interest rates and persistent legal hassles.Shares of Deutsche Bank have lost 17.8% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 13.3%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2102,MS,"Ratings of Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by the Moody's Investors Service, the rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). The company’s senior debt rating has been affirmed at A3. Further, the outlook has remained stable.Why the Ratings Were ReiteratedThe ratings affirmation is indicative of Morgan Stanley’s consistent improvement in profitability in the past few years. This reflects strong growth in the company’s Wealth Management segment and its efforts to strengthen efficiency through efficient cost control.Apart from these, rebound in Morgan Stanley’s fixed income sales and trading operations and robust capital markets related business performance despite low volatility across the industry support profitability. The rating agency anticipates that these factors along with lower tax rates will likely boost bottom-line growth over “the near-to-medium term.”These credit positives are marginally offset by faster pace of growth in loan (mostly tied to low risk secured loans to Morgan Stanley’s wealth management clients), which is significantly “above the aggregate US bank loan growth rate or the growth rate of nominal US GDP.” Also, the company shows more vulnerability to stress as it has “experienced a greater decline in its capital ratios under the Federal Reserve's severely adverse DFAST stress test than has any of its closest US peers.”Driven by this, Morgan Stanley has been gradually increasing its share repurchase authorization. But Moody’s anticipates the company to return more capital to the shareholders in the coming years as its profitability continues to improve. Though this will lower the company’s capital ratios, these are expected to “remain above than median of its global investment bank peers.”What Could Make Moody's Change the RatingsRatings of Morgan Stanley are not likely to be upgraded in absence of considerable lower dependence of its earnings to the capital markets operation. Also, improvement in capital and liquidity ratios along with lower volatility in earnings will support the ratings upgrade.However, Morgan Stanley’s ratings could be downgraded in case of deterioration in credit quality and a rise in illiquid risk assets. Further, worsening liquidity profile and any indications of control or risk management failures may lead to lowering of the company’s ratings.The company’s shares have rallied 26.9% in the past year, outperforming 25.9% gain of the industry. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, other than Morgan Stanley, the rating agency has affirmed ratings of some big banks including Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) over the past few months.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2104,MS,"On further clarification of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in late December 2017, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) announced revised earnings for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 in its latest annual filing.Revision of certain estimates related to the net discrete tax provision on account of the tax reform led to a $43 million increase in the provision for income taxes. In January 2018, it had reported provisions of $4.1 billion for 2017.Further, segment wise, provision for income taxes was raised $89 million for Wealth Management while Institutional Securities witnessed a $45 million decline. Also, Investment Management unit’s provisions were reduced $1 million.Moreover, Morgan Stanley restated full-year 2017 net income available to common shareholders of $6.1 million or $3.07 per share, down from $6.2 billion or $3.09 per share, previously reported. Also, for the fourth-quarter 2017, earnings per share were reduced 3 cents.Further, the company expects effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 22-25% in 2018.The tax reform is likely to improve loan demand in the economy and lend support to companies’ bottom line in the coming years. However, large one-time charges made a significant impact on 2017 results of many companies.Morgan Stanley’s solid capital position keeps it well poised for growth. Also, initiatives to offload its non-core assets to lower balance-sheet risks and shift focus on less capital-incentive operations like wealth management are commendable. Moreover, its efforts to reduce expenses are likely to continue lending support to the bottom line.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained nearly 21.1% in a year, outperforming 19.4% growth of the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2105,MS,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) — Lloyd Blankfein — received about 9% pay hike in his total compensation package. His annual salary has been increased to $24 million in 2017 from $22 million in 2016, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing last week.The CEO’s pay package includes a base salary of $2 million and annual variable compensation of $22 million for 2017. Notably, 80% of his annual variable compensation consists of performance-based restricted stock units or ""PSUs"", while the remaining is in the form of cash.The hike, as believed, is well deserved keeping in mind Blankfein’s contribution to Goldman, when he took over the reins of the company in 2006. He has been instrumental in boosting pre-tax earnings by 8% to $11.1 billion in 2017. Moreover, the company reported revenues of $32.1 billion, which improved 5% year over year, despite challenging market-making business environment.Besides Goldman’s strong operating performance in the year, the CEO’s announced $5-billion growth plan was also a tailwind. All positive factors have caused investors to become optimistic about this banking giant’s long-term prospects. Notably, the company's share price appreciated roughly 6.4% in 2017 compared with 19.5% growth registered by the industry.Among other banking giants, Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) chairman as well as CEO — Brian Moynihan — is expected to receive $23 million as total compensation for 2017, which reflects a rise of 15% year over year. Among others, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also increased their CEOs’ compensation.Blankfein has also been adept in strategically evaluating the various facets of Goldman’s major businesses. Besides announcing numerous cost-cutting initiatives and divestment of non-core units, the CEO has single-handedly revived profitability at the bank by handling several legal settlements.We believe Blankfein’s pay hike will prove to be a major morale booster. Goldman’s fundamentals remain highly promising with a diverse business model and a solid balance sheet.Goldman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2106,MS,"Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) chief executive officer (CEO) - Michael Corbat - received about 48% pay hike in his total compensation package. His annual salary has been increased to $23 million in 2017 from $15.5 million in 2016, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing last week.The CEO’s pay package includes a base salary of $1.5 million, cash bonus of $6.5 million and $15 million deferred incentives for 2017. Though the CEO failed to meet the financial targets of achieving tangible return on common equity, or ROTCE — a key profitability ratio — to 10% within two years, Corbat’s extraordinary leadership quality and Citigroup’s strong operating performance in the year led to the hike.The company’s net income climbed 6% to $15.8 billion in 2017, excluding impact of the tax reform. However, including the impact of the tax reform, the company reported a net loss of $6.2 billion. Moreover, the company reported revenues of $71.4 billion, up 2% year over year.Notably, in the stress test results for 2017, Citigroup emerged triumphant. The company not only managed to clear the test but outperformed other major banks as well. In its 2017 capital plan, Citigroup received approval for $15.6 billion worth of share repurchases for the four quarters beginning third-quarter 2017 and 100% dividend hike.All positive factors have caused investors to become optimistic about Citigroup's long-term prospects. Notably, the company's share price appreciated roughly 25.2% in 2017, outperforming 18.8% growth registered by the industry, following a 15.9% rise in 2016.Among other banking giants, Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) chairman as well as CEO — Brian Moynihan — is expected to receive $23 million as total compensation for 2017, which reflects a rise of 15% year over year. Among others, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also increased their CEOs’ compensation.The bank said in the filing, “In addition to Citi’s positive operating results, the [remuneration] committee considered market levels of pay for the CEO role at peer institutions and Citi’s significantly improved total shareholder returns.”Notably, Citigroup has improved on capital return to shareholders since the financial crisis, investment in core businesses and passed regulatory tests. Corbat has also been adept in strategically evaluating the various facets of the bank’s major businesses. Besides announcing numerous cost-cutting initiatives and divestment of non-core units, the CEO has handled several legal settlements.We believe Corbat’s pay hike will prove to be a major morale booster. Citigroup’s fundamentals remain highly promising with a diverse business model and a strong balance sheet.Citigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2107,MS,"Per an article by Bloomberg, The Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) is in talks to acquire a New York-based startup, Clarity Money. The bank plans to fuse the personal finance services that the startup offers with its digital consumer lending platform — Marcus by Goldman Sachs.People familiar with the matter disclosed that no deal had been finalized so far. Also, there are possibilities of the deal coming to nothing.This uncertainty is assumed to have provoked a negative reaction from investors as reflected by the 4.2% drop in Goldman Sachs’ share price last trading session.Brief on the Two Digital PlatformsLaunched in October 2016, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, has been delivering good results so far. The platform exceeded the bank’s expectation of lending about $2 billion in loans by year-end 2017.Moreover, in a bid to expand its offerings, the company acquired Oakland, CA-based startup, Final, which helped in reducing fraud by offering customized credit card numbers. After introducing credit card offering feature, the online lending platform began to provide home improvement loans. The fintech startup, Clarity Money was founded by Adam Dell, the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell. The application helps draw attention to recurring charges and allows cancellation of unwanted bills.Per the article, the startup which started about a year ago, has about 50 employees and more than 500,000 users.Our TakeGoldman Sachs’ efforts to provide consumers with a cheaper personal finance option are encouraging. This step, a far cry from its traditional retail deposits and investment management services, is likely to bolster its financial health. Lately, weakness in trading activity has kept its revenues under pressure.Also, these strategic investments might help the bank reach its $5 billion revenue target that was disclosed in September 2017, to be achieved by 2020.Nevertheless, costs arising from brokerage and market development remain near to medium-term headwinds.Shares of Goldman have gained 9.3% over the past six months, underperforming 15.3% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space are Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Raymond James Financial (RJF  -  Free Report) and The Charles Schwab Corp.

The company’s share price has increased 15.9% in the past year.Raymond James has witnessed 1.6% upward earnings estimate revision for 2018, in the last 30 days. Its share price has risen 11.9% in the past year.Charles Schwab’s shares have gained 22.5% in a year and its earnings estimates for 2018 have moved up 8.6% in the last 30 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2108,MS,"The financial sector has performed favorably recently on the back of encouraging earnings results. Both JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) have posted better-than-expected earnings results. Strong rise in investment banking fees and stable equity trading income supported the top-line of both banks, including investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report).After the passage of the much-awaited Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year, several major banks have announced big one-time charges related to the new tax law. However, major regional banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America managed to generate quarterly income despite bearing huge tax charges. Further in the near future, reduction in corporate taxes will continue to boost earnings of these banks as they will be able to retain more of their revenues.All the three aforementioned banks have not only posted upbeat earnings but also managed to hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), highlighting a positive sentiment over them. Following these promising trends, investing in financial mutual funds with a significant holding in these companies will be a prudent decision.Q4 Earnings in FocusBoth JPMorgan and Bank of America reported fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) and revenues, which beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, both the top and bottom-line of the two big banks rose substantially. Solid loan growth and higher interest rates supported net interest income growth. Further, rise in investment banking fees and stable equity trading income supported revenues.Additionally, with EPS and revenues beat, Morgan Stanley registered strong revenues growth on the back of effective wealth and asset management. Higher asset management fees, net interest income and transactional revenues boosted the company’s revenues from wealth and investment management.(Read More)Tax Charge: Short-Term Pain, Long-Term GainIn its quarterly earnings results, JPMorgan highlighted a one-time tax related charge of $2.4 billion, which it had to bear during the quarter. However, optimism remains that gains from lower tax rates will aid profitability in the quarters ahead. Most of the major financial companies bore a one-time charge related to the new tax law in the last quarter of 2017, but a low corporate tax rate of 21%is expected to boost gains for these banks, as they face a high tax burden that makes them big gainers when tax rates go down.Moreover, despite the tax charge finance sector is dominating this early sample of results, per the latest Earnings Outlook. Total earnings for the 37.5% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 that have reported results already are up 1.9% on 3% higher revenues, with 90% beating EPS estimates and 50% beating revenue estimates. (Read More)In the past three months, the financial sector jumped 12%, remaining one of the best performers among the S&P 500 sectors. Additionally, mutual funds related to this sector registered strong returns.

2109,MS,"Triple-digit gains in regular-day Tuesday trading in both the Dow and Nasdaq were bolstered by a number of different things — strong housing starts and a lack of relative geopolitical tension early this week among them — but nothing so influential as a very strong Q1 earnings season. We are still in the early stages so far (only a week has passed since Delta Air Lines beat estimates on both top and bottom lines), but overall results have been notably better than expected.While after-the-bell earnings reports yesterday were better than expected across the board, some companies performed more impressively than others. While Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted a robust earnings beat, IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) eked out a positive surprise on new corporate tax benefits alone. (IBM’s Watson enterprise has thus far failed to inspire fresh investment in Big Blue.) As a result, IBM has shed more than 5% in today’s pre-market, while ISRG shares are up 5% this morning.New Q1 earnings reports are following suit, starting with Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which left estimates in the dust this morning. This investment banking major posted $1.45 per share on $11.1 billion in quarterly revenues, outpacing the $1.28 and $10.5 billion in the Zacks consensus estimates, respectively. Net income grew 38% in Q1, whereas Sales & Trading rose 26%. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.Fellow financial institution U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a penny to 95 cents per share, but missed on revenue expectations, bringing in $5.47 billion as opposed to the $5.53 billion our analysts were looking for. This still represents good year-over-year growth from $5.29 billion in Q1 2017, but pre-market trading shows USB shares slipping half a percentage point at this hour. For more on USB’s earnings, click here.Based on Chicago’s North Shore, Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) also topped earnings consensus by a penny to 59 cents per share. Revenues also slightly surpassed expectations in Q1, reporting $7.39 billion in sales. Guidance for full-year 2018 has been posted at between $2.80 and $2.90 per share, and the Zacks consensus is roughly at the midpoint. Shares are off 1.3% ahead of today’s opening bell. For more on ABT’s earnings, click here.Defense components major Textron (TXT  -  Free Report), however, performed much better this morning — 76 cents per share blew away expectations of 46 cents, and more than double the 37 cents per share a year ago. Sales of $3,296 million also impressed, both above the estimated $3,114 million and the year-ago figure of $3,093 million. Industrial sales perked up 14%, and the company saw gains from its Arctic Cat acquisition. Shares are up 6.7% in today’s pre-market. For more on TXT’s earnings, click here.

2111,MS,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q4 earnings releases. The going is good so far, with five big banks crushing estimates on both lines and Wells Fargo missing on both.The Zacks Sector Rank for some top banks is in the top 6% while the Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 15%. The uptrend in the benchmark U.S. Treasury yields in recent times thanks to a hawkish Fed, Trump’s tax reform and U.S. economic growth momentum are the other positives for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at banking earnings in detail:Big Bank Earnings in FocusStrong investment banking results and higher rates drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income growth. Further, rise in investment banking fees and stable equity trading income supported the top line. Managed net revenues of $25.5 billion in the quarter were up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25 billion.Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in fourth-quarter 2017 on prudent expense management and strong consumer banking. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.14 per share. Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $17.3 billion in the reported quarter. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.1 billion.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share improved from the prior-year quarter earnings of $0.96 but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. The quarter’s total revenues were $22.1 billion, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.4 billion. However, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $21.6 billion.Despite weak fixed income trading revenues, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 15.9%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.68, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.90. Further, the bottom line witnessed 11.8% year-over-year improvement.Though fixed-income trading activities were a drag in the fourth quarter, continued momentum in investment banking business supported the bottom line. Goldman’s net revenues were down 4% year over year to $7.8 billion in the quarter under review. However, the figure handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 15%.Despite the trading slump, loan growth and impressive investment banking performance drove Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 47 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. Also, the figure was 21% higher than the prior-year quarter. Notably, the results exclude a one-time charge of 27 cents related to the tax act.A fall in fixed income trading revenues (as expected) and mortgage banking losses were outweighed by strong net interest income growth (driven by loan growth and higher interest rates), stable equity trading income and higher investment banking fees. Adjusted net revenues amounted to $21.4 billion, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.3 billion. Also, it was up nearly 7% from the prior-year quarter.Higher interest income and improvement in underwriting fees drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents.

In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.1 billion.Market ImpactInvestors, who have their hopes pinned on an upbeat earnings season, Trump’s promises for deregulation and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report),PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) responded to the earnings releases.

2113,MS,"We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected. Underwriting fees jumped 42% in the quarter, somewhat offset by a lower fixed income segment. For full-year 2017, earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60 beat the Zacks consensus by 2 cents. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, just met expectations of 36 cents per share on the bottom line while surpassing estimates for quarterly revenues to $1.61 billion from the $1.58 billion anticipated.

Though disappointing to the Street, EPS growth year over year was 18.2%. For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Finally, M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #3, posted a nice positive surprise on its bottom line: $2.66 per share versus the Zacks consensus of $2.40.

Additionally, per the Beige Book “employment continued to grow at a modest pace” in majority of the districts. Also, most of the districts reported “modest to moderate price growth,” which boosted sentiment.Higher rate environment and optimism over steady economic growth weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.544% to 2.579% on Wednesday. Higher treasury yields generally boost profitability from banks’ lending activities.Following this development, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) advanced 0.8%.

The reported figure was 14% above the prior-year quarter.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained more than 1.5% in pre-market trading, largely driven by impressive investment banking performance. The stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Solid underwriting fees (up 42%) and higher net interest income were largely responsible for the improved results. Also, the company’s capital ratios remained strong.However, as expected, fixed-income, currency and commodities income (down 45%) and equity trading income declined (down 2%). Also, lower advisory fees were an undermining factor.After considering a net discrete tax provision, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $686 million or 29 cents per share.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58.

The figure was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.5 billion.Net interest income was $995 million, up 13% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely driven by a rise in interest income. Also, total non-interest revenues of $8.5 billion grew 5% year over year, primarily supported by improvement in investments.Total non-interest expenses were $7 billion, up 4% year over year. The rise was due to a 5% increase in compensation and benefits costs.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, down 7% year over year. Net revenues of $4.5 billion fell 2% from the prior-year quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower trading income and advisory revenues, partially offset by increase in underwriting income.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations totaled $1.2 billion, a jump of 29% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenues were $4.4 billion, up 10% year over year, driven by higher asset management fee revenues, net interest income and transactional revenues.Investment Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $80 million, surging significantly from the year-ago quarter.

This was part of the company's 2017 capital plan.Our TakeMorgan Stanley’s initiatives to offload its non-core assets to lower balance-sheet risks and shift focus on less capital-incentive operations like wealth management are commendable. Further, steady improvement in investment banking income will support its top line. However, a decline in bond trading fees owing to low client activity is an issue.Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteCurrently, Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined 3.8% over the last 30 days.However, Morgan Stanley has an impressive earnings surprise history. Before posting the earnings beat in Q4, the company delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteOverall, on an average the company posted positive earnings surprise of 16.3% in the trailing four quarters.RevenuesMorgan Stanley posted net revenues of $9.5 billion, which compared favorably with the year-ago number of $9 billion.

However, since the latest earnings performance is yet to be reflected in the estimate revisions, the rank is subject to change.

2117,MS,"Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) slumped as much as 3% on Wednesday morning after the company posted its fourth-quarter earnings report. While profits excluding one-time items actually beat our consensus estimates, the investment banking behemoth witnessed a shocking drop in trading revenues—leading to its first loss in six years when factoring in a tax legislation charge.Goldman reported adjusted earnings of $5.68 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.90 and expanding 11.8% year-over-year. However, a $4.4 billion charge related to the recent tax bill’s consideration of overseas profits and accounting practices resulted in a quarterly loss of $1.93 billion, or $5.51 per share.Total revenues in the quarter came in at $7.8 billion, surpassing our consensus estimate of $7.6 billion. For the full fiscal year, revenues were $32.1 billion, up about 5% year-over-year. Still, investors were shocked at the results in Goldman’s Institutional Client Services division, which brought in just $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter.Revenues in this unit were down 34% from the prior-year quarter. The sharp decline underscored weak revenues in the company’s ever-important fixed income, currencies, and commodities operations. Total revenues in this category were down about 50% year-over-year.Goldman’s first net loss in six years will certainly grab headline, but the company’s Q4 performance does really not change the fundamental picture for the financial sector. We already knew trading revenues would be down this quarter. A less volatile global market means less trading activity, which cuts into the top line.Last week, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) reported a decline in fixed income trading. Similarly, fixed income revenues at Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) were down about 18%. Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) just reported a double-digit decline in fixed income revenues on Wednesday, and our consensus estimate are calling for the same from Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) tomorrow.Goldman’s exposure to fixed income trading means that weakness in this segment will typically hit it the hardest. But Goldman and its competitors should still stand to benefit from the number of positive forces driving the financial sector.“With the global economy poised to accelerate, new U.S. tax legislation providing tailwinds and a leading franchise across our businesses, we are well positioned to serve our clients and make significant progress on the growth plan we outlined in September,” Goldman CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein said in a statement.Meanwhile, the one-time charge that caused Goldman to sink into the red will shortly be outweighed by the company’s lower effective tax rate. Goldman executives confirmed that the firm will pay about 24% in the upcoming year.Stepping back a bit, our “Finance” sector is currently ranked #1 out of the 16 sectors tracked by the Zacks Sector Rank. The group has witnessed 154 total positive earnings estimate revisions, outweighing the total of negative revisions by about 27. The average projected earnings growth in the Finance sector sits at 15.06%, which crushes the 11.84% we expect to see in the broader S&P 500. But the group also has an average PEG ratio of 1.70, so investors are getting a great price for that earnings growth right now.Want more analysis from this author?

2118,MS,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, slated for Wednesday, Apr 18, are likely to witness a rebound in trading income, one of the major revenue components. This will have a positive impact on its earnings, which is expected to be slightly hit by muted investment banking performance.After three consecutive quarters of muted activities, the markets witnessed significant volatility and revival of client activities in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates were concerns. These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading while equity trading didn’t fare better either.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Notably, equity trading revenues are expected to witness substantial growth in the to-be-reported quarter compared with fixed income trading revenues as Morgan Stanley had divested fixed income trading operations over the last few years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $2.14 billion reflects a rise of 6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.70 billion indicates a decline of nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter.Overall, first-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $3.78 billion, up 8.2% year over year.Here are the other factors that are expected to influence Morgan Stanley’s first-quarter results:Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. Also, overall loan demand was decent — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. So, NII is anticipated to witness a modest improvement.A slight fall in underwriting fees: Unlike prior quarters, growth in underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be muted. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances. As debt origination fees account for more than 50% of total underwriting fees for Morgan Stanley, this will likely have an adverse impact on overall underwriting fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $520 million reflects a year-over-year fall of 2.1%.Further, high volatility in the equity markets across the globe is expected to have somewhat slowed down equity issuances. While fourth-quarter 2017 was an exception, IPOs and follow-on offerings in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to be modest. Thus, equity underwriting fees are anticipated to remain stable or improve marginally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $381 million reflects a decrease of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 2.1% year-over-year decline as the consensus estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $901 million.Advisory fees to show weakness: M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally witnessed a fall in the first quarter, though the overall deal value recorded a significant rise. Thus, as number of deals declined, advisory fees are expected to be adversely impacted to some extent. So, Morgan Stanley is not likely to remain untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $476 million, down 4% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Nevertheless, as revenues are expected to rise, compensation expenses will likely witness a slight increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:We cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Morgan Stanley this time. This is because the stock does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.28 cents reflects a 28% jump on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $10.5 billion indicates 7.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 17. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

2119,MS,"The fight over who will acquire a majority stake in India’s e-commerce retail giant Flipkart is intensifying. According to reports, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is already in advanced talks to acquire a 51% stake in Flipkart. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) too is leaving no stone unturned to capture a significant stake in the company. So much so that Amazon reportedly has offered a breakup fee of nearly $1-$2 billion as part of its bid to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart. That said, it is too early to predict who will have the last laugh, as none of the three companies have yet commented on this.However, the big question is how much does Flipkart matter to Amazon and Walmart. It surely does, given that Flipkart is the biggest e-commerce company in India and has an enviable customer base in that country, it will only strengthen the presence of both Amazon and Walmart in this vast market. Understandably, India is a lucrative market for both Amazon and Walmart, which are fighting hard to take a lead in the retail race much like every in other country.Flipkart to Help Build Stronger PresenceFlipkart is the world’s third-most funded private company and one of the most successful Indian e-commerce startups. The company has raised more than $7 billion from a number of global investors such as Softbank, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and DST Global and has completed quite a significant number of acquisitions in the past few years, thus making it a name synonymous with retail e-commerce in India. For Amazon and Walmart, a stake in Flipkart definitely means a lot, as they will get to operate in a lucrative market.In fact, Flipkart to Indians is much like Amazon and is the biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second biggest. Flipkart has overtaken the likes of Snapdeal and other e-commerce companies in India within 10 years of its inception and is clearly ahead of others including Amazon. Understandably, Amazon stands to benefit if it succeeds in acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart and it will also end the rivalry between the two companies in India. Walmart, on the other hand, too will benefit as it is striving hard to compete with its biggest rival Amazon in the e-commerce space.Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been the cash-on-delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Today, most e-commerce companies in India have adopted this model, which has helped them earn the trust of consumers, thereby increasing their revenues.Amazon and Walmart’s India Presence to Get a BoostGlobally, Amazon is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race. However, Walmart continues to be its closest rivals given that the brick-and-mortar giant is making fast moves to make its online presence felt. Undoubtedly, adding Flipkart will only strengthen Amazon online dominance and at the same time take the competition to the global arena.Moreover, Amazon is the second largest e-commerce company in India and a major reason behind this is that Flipkart enjoys the trust of customers, a lot of which comes from its cash on delivery model of business. If Amazon happens to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart, it will most likely put an end to this competition. Moreover, Flipkart already has a strong delivery arm much like Amazon has in the United States. This will help Amazon use Flipkart’s logistics wing and aid both the companies to focus more on increasing their revenues instead of competing. This will not only help Flipkart in strengthening its profits but also add muscle to its supply chain and aid in boosting its efficiency in procurement and product assortmentOn the other hand, Walmart has a negligible presence in the estimated $670 billion retail market in India with a meager 21 wholesale stores, while it has no presence in the e-commerce space. The company has been trying hard to make its presence felt in the online retail market since 2014 and adding Flipkart will definitely help it expand its footprint in India. Moreover, Walmart’s failed joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business has left the company with no choice but to acquire an existing business. If the deal fall into place, it is likely to strengthen Walmart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to. While Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walmart carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing upAlthough nothing has been finalized yet, Flipkart definitely looks to be a lucrative proposition for both the companies given the huge retail market in India. Moreover, Flipkart too stands to benefit as the company has been incurring losses despite its mass appeal. While, for Walmart, acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart will help the company get an edge of Amazon in the e-commerce space in India, for Amazon it will become easier to spread out and the same time focus more on its profits that competing with Flipkart in India.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.

2120,MS,"The Dow enjoyed a week of strong gains as trade war and Syria related fears receded. President Trump indicated that trade disputes should be resolved through discussions. Meanwhile, China’s President Xi Jinping pledged to open up China’s economy further. Trump also indicated that a military strike on Syria was not imminent. As a result, investors chose to focus on upcoming bank earnings as financials gained.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 2.3% on last Friday as increasing worries of a trade war brewing between the United States and China led to a huge selloff. Moreover, equities hit their session lows in the final two hours of trading after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank would keep increasing interest rates to curb inflation.The Dow tanked 0.7% over last week on escalating trade war related tensions between U.S. and China. The volatile week started on a low as China announced tariffs of $3 billion on U.S. goods including pork, apples and dry fruit. Markets gained traction after White House gave an indication that the U.S. government would not want to enter into a trade war with China.Notably, Thursday was also the first day on NYSE since March 2013 when new 52-week highs outnumbered 52-week lows. Powell’s statement that the U.S. bank would keep increasing interest rates to keep inflation in control once again made investors jittery.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.2% on Monday as trade war tensions eased to some extent after officials from President Trump’s administration said trade disputes with China could be resolved through discussion. Such comments helped stocks rally almost throughout the trading session.However, stocks pared most of the day’s gains shortly before the market closed on news of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raiding the office of Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The index increased 1.8% on Tuesday after Chinese President Xi promised to take measures to open the country’s economy and cut import tariffs. Investors’ confidence rebounded as fears of a trade war eased to some extent, which saw stocks rallying almost throughout the trading session.Moreover, shares of Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) too jumped after the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of the Congress following news of a data misuse scandal involving millions of users.The index declined 0.9% on Wednesday following President Donald Trump’s tweet warning Russia of a possible military strike on Syria. Escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia saw investors taking a defensive stance, with U.S. stocks tumbling and safe havens rallying.The decline was led by bank stocks such as Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). However, shares of Facebook increased as the company’s CEO continued his testimony in front of Congress for the second day.The index gained 1.2% on Thursday after investors ignored geopolitical tensions and chose to focus on the upcoming earnings season. Investor concerns receded after Trump tweeted saying that a military strike on Syria was unlikely in the near future. Financials were the best performers of the day as investors focused on upcoming bank earnings.Components Moving the Index The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors.

The new figure will add up to an annual dividend of $2.8688 per share.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) P&G is considered to be one of the dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 Index, given its consistent increase in dividends each year in its span of operations of more than 100 years in business. This, along with a dividend yield of more than 3% (3.53% as of Apr 10, 2018) helped P&G to attain the position.

Apple has a Zacks Rank #4.Reportedly, the company has labeled the devices with same price tags as other regular models, which are $699 for iPhone 8 and $799 for 8 Plus. The new device is expected to offset weakness arising from lackluster sales of the premium iPhone X.iPhone, since its launch in 2007, has been the mainstay of the tech giant’s revenues. However, the spurt in revenues from iPhone in the last quarter was owing to higher iPhone average selling price when total shipments witnessed a decline.

2121,MS,"Quarterly earnings releases will hit the market in full swing this week. Big banks are all set to report. Let’s dig deeper into the likely earnings picture of the big six banking companies that could drive the performance of the sector ahead.According to our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Inside Our Surprise PredictionAmong the big six, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) are likely to report on Apr 13. JPM has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.29%. The same is the kind of surprise prediction for Wells Fargo, with a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.73%.On the other hand, Citi has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.74%. This lowers the predictive power of ESP because a negative ESP dampens our surprise prediction power that gets a boost from a favorable Zacks Rank.Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is expected to report on Apr 16 before the market opens. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of -0.31%. Needless to say, here also, surprise prediction is tough. All four stocks hail from a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 38%).On Apr 17 and Apr 18, GoldmanSachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) are likely to come up with their earnings releases, respectively. Both have a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP of 0.00%, which doesn’t make them sure-shot candidates for an earnings beat.Notably, while both stocks belong to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 49%), the VGM Scores are not favorable with Goldman having a score of D and Morgan Stanley having a score of C.  What Fundamentals Indicate About Bank ETFs?As discussed above, chances of a broad-based earnings beat are moderate. However, the financial sector, is likely to log a strong show in Q1 and the coming quarters, per the Earnings Trends issued on Apr 11, 2018 (read: Inside Q4 Earnings Performance of Banking ETFs).Major banks, which make up about 45% of the sector’s total earnings in the S&P 500, are expected to post 11.3% earnings growth on 4.8% higher revenues. It is the Fed and Trump who can drive the sector.The Fed in the form of policy tightening and consequent higher yields should have benefited the sector in Q1. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury started 2018 with 2.46%, hit a high of 2.94% in February, but finally came down to 2.74% on Mar 29.  The average benchmark bond yield in Q1 of 2018 was around 2.7615%, up from 2.4466% average yield recorded in the year-ago quarter (read: Q1 ETF Asset Report: Developed Markets Win, High-Yield Loses).Trump in the form of tax reform, which has been passed in late 2017, can benefit the financial space. Financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5% in the S&P sector universe, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates, quoted on Reuters. Naturally, the section is poised to perform better in a low-tax environment (read: Best ETF Strategies for a Hawkish Fed).ETFs in FocusSo, investors pinning their hopes on a moderate-to-upbeat earnings season, Trump’s policies for a fiscal boost and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) are performing before the earnings releases.These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks. Goldman has moderate exposure in the aforementioned ETFs; rather it is heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report) (see all Financial ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2122,MS,"Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) climbed on Wednesday for the second day in a row as the streaming giant builds momentum ahead of its first quarter earnings results. Netflix has also been one of the best performing stocks so far this year. But now investors should look to the company’s Q1 estimates to see if this outstanding run looks poised to continue in the immediate future.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) both significantly upped their price targets for Netflix this week, pointing directly to the company’s international growth opportunities. This is great news for Netflix investors, yet these more long-term outlooks don’t necessarily signal a strong first quarter from Netflix (also read: Why Is Netflix Stock Climbing Today?).While markets lean more bearish amid Chinese trade war concerns, many investors will be on the hunt for stocks that are set to perform well in the near-term. With that said, let’s take a look at some of Netflix’s current estimates as we get closer to the release of the streaming power’s Q1 financial results.  Q1 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Netflix to post revenues of $3.69 billion, which would mark a nearly 40% surge from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, Netflix’s Q1 earnings are expected to soar by 57.5% to hit $0.63 per share.These estimates clearly show investors that Netflix is expected to continue its top and bottom line expansion in the first quarter, but investors will need to know more before they decide to buy Netflix stock ahead of earnings.Earnings ESP WhispersThe next thing that investors should consider is if Netflix is actually expected to post better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 1%. This means that Netflix is a stock that looks poised to top first quarter earnings estimates.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important factor to consider ahead of Netflix’s Q1 report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Netflix, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Netflix, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Netflix, Inc. QuoteAs we can see, Netflix has a relatively solid earnings surprise history over the last few years, although the company has missed earnings estimates in two of the last three quarters. Despite some recent misses, Netflix tends to see its stock price climb immediately following an earnings release.Bottom Line Past performance is clearly not a barometer of future success. But in Netflix’s case, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 1%. This means that investors should consider the stock as likely to top earnings estimates based on our proven system.Netflix is also expected to top its current first quarter subscriber growth estimates, according to Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). This is a great sign for investors and the company as it prepares to fight against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu, HBO, and soon enough Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), in the war for streaming supremacy.Netflix is scheduled to report its Q1 financial results after market close on Monday, April 16.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2123,MS,"The euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation is pushing Wall Street to new heights this year. After hitting 2,700 on the second trading session of the New Year, the S&P 500 breached another milestone of 2,800, for the first time.Moreover, the Dow Jones also crossed the 26,000 mark, easily setting the record for the fastest 1,000-point rise in its history after topping 25,000 on Jan 4 (read: Top & Flop ETFs of the New Year).Buoyancy FlowingThe massive $1.5-trillion tax cuts will create an economic surge both domestic and international, boosting job growth and earnings of corporates. Additionally, jump in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat economic data added to the strength. Manufacturing activity, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management, climbed to the second-highest reading in six years while construction spending hit record highs in November with broad-based gains in both private and public outlays. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, capping the strongest year of sales growth since 2014.The market is anticipating that companies will come up with big gains in earnings and increased estimates for this year driven by tax cut savings. The Q4 earnings season is off to a strong start, with earnings of 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 13.6% from the same period last year on 9.1% higher revenues, with 73.1% beating EPS estimates and 80.8% beating revenue estimates. Overall, total earnings and revenues are projected to grow 9.2% and 7%, respectively (read: 4 ETFs & Stocks from Favorite Sectors for Q4 Earnings).However, the rally fizzled out later in yesterday’s trading session on concerns over the possible government shutdown. This represents the second drop so far this year. Congress needs to pass a spending bill by the end of Jan 19 to avoid a government shutdown. This pullback could be just a pause in the rally as traders took the chance to book some profits after a record run.Given the bullish fundamentals, the dips might charge up investors to snap up stocks and ETFs on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). This is because these ranks suggest strengthening fundamentals and superior weighting methodologies that could allow them to lead higher than their cousins in a booming market. Then, we narrowed down the list to funds having lower P/E ratio than 20.57 for the broad market fund (SPY).Here are the five ETFs that are currently undervalued and could generate solid returns in a rising stock market.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) – P/E Ratio: 15.01With AUM of $33.7 billion, this is the ultra-popular ETF targeting the broad financial segment and follows the Financial Select Sector Index. It holds 67 stocks in its basket, with double-digit allocation to the top two firms Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report). The ETF charges 14 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) - P/E Ratio: 15.26The most popular choice in the homebuilding space, XHB, follows the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index.

The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2.First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (FXD  -  Free Report) - P/E Ratio: 15.53This ETF offers exposure to the consumer discretionary sector, holding well-diversified 116 stocks in its basket.

It has amassed $159.7 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees. The fund carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2.How to Find Bargain Stocks?For this, we have used our Zacks stock screener and have selected stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 and a VGM Style Score of B or better. A top rank suggests rising earnings estimates, which indicate an optimistic view on earnings by analysts and hence higher chances of outperformance. Then we looked for stocks having a low P/E than the S&P 500 index (20.49), a double-digit estimated earnings growth rate for this year and a solid Industry Rank in the top 40%.Finally, we arrive at the five stocks that are cheap and have the potential to deliver higher returns with lower volatility.Micron Technology Inc (MU  -  Free Report) - P/E Ratio: 4.36Based in Boise, ID, Micron Technology is one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.

2124,MS,"Investors usually attach a greater degree of importance to investment banks compared to their plain vanilla counterparts. Yet, as earnings season heats up, it would not be out of place to point out that their troubles seem to mimic those of the wider banking sector.Goldman Sachs’ fourth-quarter 2017 results are likely to reflect a $5 billion negative impact triggered by the new tax reform, which levied taxes on overseas income. Also, deferred tax assets (DTAs) will lose value due to tax cut. (Read: Goldman Expects Tax Reform to Have a One-Time $5B Impact) Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said on Jan 5 that its upcoming earnings numbers are likely to reflect a $1.25 billion negative impact, also due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On the positive side, both stocks hold promise in 2018. A bullish global economy, higher inflation and rising market volatility are likely to provide a major boost to these stocks in the year ahead.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings numbers on Jan 17 and Jan 18, respectively. While Goldman Sachs has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other banking stocks reporting earnings over these two days include Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report).Return on Assets (ROA)Examining earnings per share alone would not generate any significant insights when determining the level of profitability of a bank. Return on Assets is a ratio which reveals how efficiently a bank is utilizing its assets to generate profits.Currently, Morgan Stanley holds total assets of $99.7 billion while Goldman Sachs has total assets of around $97 billion. Our research shows that the average one year trailing 12-month ROA for Goldman Sachs stands at 0.95%, marginally higher than 0.85% for Morgan Stanley.Price PerformanceIn terms of price performance, Morgan Stanley is a clear winner. Morgan Stanley has gained 30.8% over the last one year, outperforming the broader industry which has gained 25.4% over the same period. In comparison, Goldman Sachs has gained only 9% over the same period and is well behind both Morgan Stanley and the broader industry.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 2.75, which is below the S&P 500 average of 3.93. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.29 Goldman Sachs is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Morgan Stanley is also undervalued compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 1.39, it is marginally pricier than Goldman Sachs.   Dividend YieldMorgan Stanley’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 1.81%. With a dividend yield of 1.24%, Goldman Sachs’ shareholders earn a lower dividend yield than those of Morgan Stanley.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Goldman Sachs has delivered earnings surprises in three of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters. While Goldman Sachs has an average earnings surprise of 9.1%, Morgan Stanley stands out with an average earnings surprise of 16.3%.When considering Earnings ESP values, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks since both their ESP values stand at zero. At the same time, Morgan Stanley’s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 5.2% over the last 30 days, higher than Goldman Sachs’ level of 2.8%.  ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that both stocks are nearly neck to neck when considering valuation and return on assets. Also, both stocks have an ESP reading of zero, so there is little to choose between the two on this count.However, Morgan Stanley is superior when considering price performance, dividend yield, estimate revisions and a more detailed earnings history. With a Zacks Rank #2 and a higher projected EPS growth for the year at 18.2% compared to Goldman Sachs’ value of 11.2%, Morgan Stanley is clearly the better of the two investment bank stocks.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

2125,MS,"Thursday, January 18, 2018We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected. Underwriting fees jumped 42% in the quarter, somewhat offset by a lower fixed income segment. For full-year 2017, earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60 beat the Zacks consensus by 2 cents. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, just met expectations of 36 cents per share on the bottom line while surpassing estimates for quarterly revenues to $1.61 billion from the $1.58 billion anticipated. Revenues rose year over year by 2.7%. For more on KEY’s earnings, click here.Another Zacks Rank #2 stock, BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report), reported EPS of 84 cents, beating estimates by 4 cents per share. Revenues in Q4 of $2.91 billion topped the $2.84 billion we had been looking for, +5% year over year. For more on BBT’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Bank of New York - Mellon (BK  -  Free Report) met expectations of 91 cents per share but missed on the top line: $3.73 billion in revenues from the $3.98 billion analysts had anticipated. Though disappointing to the Street, EPS growth year over year was 18.2%. For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Finally, M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #3, posted a nice positive surprise on its bottom line: $2.66 per share versus the Zacks consensus of $2.40. Revenues also topped expectations, coming in at $1.46 billion instead of the $1.42 billion estimate.

2126,MS,"After recording its worst annual decline of 10% in 14 years, the U.S. dollar continues its rough patch this year. This is especially true as the ICE dollar index tumbled to the lowest level against the basket of major currencies since January 2015. As such, PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish Fund (UUP  -  Free Report), tracking the dollar index, has shed 1.3% so far this year.Tightening PolicyStrengthening global economic growth and a rebound in commodity prices that have raised the prospect of monetary policy tightening outside the United States dealt a major blow to the dollar. The cheap monetary policy era ended in Asia with South Korea becoming the first major central bank to increase interest rates for the first time in more than six years. The Bank of England, too, has raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years (read: ETFs in Focus as South Korea Raises Rates).The European Central Bank (ECB) will start scaling back its massive €60 billion per month asset buying program to halve from January 2018 until at least September 2018 while the Bank of Japan will continue its massive stimulus program until the economy reaches a sustained 2% inflation.The tightening of policy will be in line with the Fed and push the U.S. dollar lower and other currencies higher, signaling more pain for the greenback. Additionally, the political development in the Euro zone is giving support to the euro and a report that the Netherlands and Spain were open to a deal for Britain to remain as close as possible to the trading bloc led to a spike in sterling (read: After a Stellar 2017, Will Euro ETFs Beat Greenback in 2018?).The weakness in the greenback came despite the dual tailwinds of U.S. economic growth being on solid footing and the Fed being on track to raise interest rates. The combination usually leads to a stronger dollar.Weak Dollar: A BoonA weak dollar has fueled a superb rally in blue chip companies, which derive most of their revenues from international markets. Notably, the Dow Jones climbed 25% last year, marking the best annual performance since 2013. It breached the 20,000-mark on Jan 6, 2017 and moved up 5,000-points last year, marking the biggest annual gain in its history. Further, the 30-stock index topped 25,000 on Jan 4, 2017 registering its fastest 1,000-point move ever (read: DOW ETFs: More Upside Ahead?).This is because a weak dollar has made dollar-denominated assets cheap for foreign investors, making U.S. multinationals more competitive thereby leading to increased profits. As such, companies having a higher percentage of international sales will likely outperform. Moreover, commodities, emerging markets as well as gold mining stocks are also getting a lift from a weak dollar.Given this, we have highlighted four ETFs and stocks that are benefiting from the current trend and are likely to do as long as dollar remains weak.ETFs to Bet OnVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK  -  Free Report)With AUM of $3.6 billion, this ETF offers diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market by tracking the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index. It holds 142 securities in its basket with none accounting for more than 8.7% of total assets. It has key holdings in information technology, consumer services, healthcare, financials, consumer goods and industrials that account for double-digit exposure each. It charges 7 basis points in annual fees and trades in good volume of around 112,000 shares a day on average. The fund has gained 5.1% so far this year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return, which delivers returns through an unleveraged investment in the most heavily traded futures contracts on physical commodities, plus the rate of interest on specified T-Bills. In total, the index holds 14 different commodities in its basket with heavyweights going to the energy (57%) space, followed by agriculture (21%), industrial metals (12%) and precious metals (9%). The fund charges 89 bps in annual fees while trades in a solid volume of 1.9 million shares per day. The product has managed assets of $2.4 billion and gained 2.2% so far this year (read: Follow Goldman to Invest in Commodity ETFs for 2018).iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM  -  Free Report)It is the most popular and widely traded emerging market ETF with AUM of $42.1 billion and average daily volume of more than 49.5 million shares. The fund tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and holds 857 securities with each holding no more than 5.7% of assets. However, the product is tilted toward the information technology and financial sectors that account for one-fourth of the portfolio each, followed by consumer discretionary (10%). Among the emerging countries, China takes the top spot at 30.4% while South Korea and Taiwan round off the next two spots with double-digit exposure each. EEM charges 69 bps in fees per year from investors and has gained 5.1% so far this year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.VanEck Vectors Gold Mining ETF (GDX  -  Free Report)This is the most popular and actively traded gold miner ETF with AUM of $7.5 billion and average daily volume of around 37.8 million shares.

2127,MS,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter and 2017 results, scheduled for Jan 18, are likely to witness a fall in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this might majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments, will likely offset the adverse impact to some extent.The decline in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter.Several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.Also, similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be largely responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.12 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% sequentially and 23.6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.92 billion indicates a rise of 1.5% from the prior quarter. But the same is expected to fall 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, fourth-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $2.86 billion, down 1.8% from the last quarter and 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s fourth-quarter results:Underwriting fees to rise: Despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the world might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $312 million reflects a surge of 38.7% from the prior-year quarter.Further, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this will lead to strong gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $440 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 14.4% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $752 million.Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. But overall loan demand remained weak — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. Therefore, NII is anticipated to witness slight growth.Advisory fees to show weakness: Slowdown in M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have an adverse effect on advisory fees. Thus, Morgan Stanley is not likely to be untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $573 million, down 8.8% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low. Notably, the company expects to lower its expenses by $1 billion in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: Following the passage of the tax act in December 2017, Morgan Stanley announced expectation of one-time charge of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets. However, this will partially be offset by nearly $160 million net discrete tax benefit, mainly related to “the remeasurement of reserves and related interest relating to the status of multi-year Internal Revenue Service tax examinations.”Therefore, the company is anticipated to record a net one-time charge of $1.25 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 77 cents reflects a 4.9% decline on a year-over-year basis. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $9.1 billion indicates 1.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

2128,MS,"After a banner year for equities in 2017, with major bourses notching all-time highs, investors now mull over what 2018 might unfold. Many market pundits believe that this will be another solid year for U.S. stocks.  Benchmarks have already kicked off the New Year on a high note, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing above 7,000 for the first time.Investors are betting that lowering of corporate tax and solid economic growth will lead to strong earnings growth. Record end-of-year holiday sales, in the meanwhile, have given traditional retailers and department store chains a shot in the arm as Americans remain optimistic about their financial wealth.Given such bullish trends, investing in big-brand stocks seems prudent. They are well-established and financially stable enough to cash in on this uptrend. But, there are significant headwinds confronting this year as well. We shouldn’t forget that such bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs may soon come crashing down. Valuation measures such as price-earnings ratios are raising caution. In the wake of adverse events as well, one can fall back on these stocks. After all, they have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investor attention even when the equity market is choppy.Winners From the Republican Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Also, the tax cut will be implemented next year instead of being delayed until 2019. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax. Meanwhile, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help multinationals, including large tech majors, bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities.Banks also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, major banks will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20%.The tax bill, in the meanwhile, will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. This in turn will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods, eventually helping retailers.Retail Stages a Solid ComebackRetailers also witnessed plenty of green in the holiday season. Total retail sales jumped 4.9% compared with the same period last year. This turned out to be the highest year-over-year rise since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report released on Dec 26.  The strong economy was a contributing factor but a pretty low unemployment rate encouraged investors to spend even more this holiday season. Moreover, consumers continue to feel confident about spending this year and beyond. As per the Conference Board, consumer confidence continues to hover near the 17-year high scaled last November.Pricey Stock MarketTwo-third of the money managers, in the meanwhile, finds the U.S. stock market’s recent record run unsettling. The gains in the current nine-year-old bull market are nearly 300%.This is the second-strongest bull run since World War II, trailing only to a massive 417% gain during October 1990 and March 2000, per data compiled by LPL Financial and FactSet Research Systems Inc.Time to Buy Big Brands: 5 Solid ChoicesWith the U.S. stock market incessantly hitting intraday and closing highs, investing in big-brand companies will be judicious. Such companies sell widely accepted products and services that can make most of the positive trends. But, if overvaluation fears pull the market down in the near term, these stocks will offer some respite as they boast stable cash flows. Needless to say, the value of brands is that they instantly convey to consumers information about quality, durability and consistency. These traits help such stocks counter market gyrations.We have thus selected five of the best big-brand American stocks that have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2129,MS,"Weak trading activities continued in the fourth quarter of 2017. This might have an adverse impact on Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results slated to be released tomorrow, given the significant dependence of its top line on this source.Though there hasn’t been significant change in market volatility in the last quarter, the decline in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results. Also similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be largely responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.In 2017, several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. But subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.At an investor conference in early December 2017, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down nearly 15% year over year. In fact, there has been hardly any change in the scenario since then.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsNotably, for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 44 cents indicates 10% growth on a year-over-year basis. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $21.3 billion implies a 6.5% increase from the prior-year quarter.Click here to know about the other factors that might influence BofA’s overall results.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteConclusionAmid a tough operating backdrop, slump in trading revenues is expected to hamper this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s top-line growth to some extent.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BofA’s Global Markets segment’s (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $3.54 billion reflects an increase of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.Trading Revenue Projections for Other CompaniesBoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) are expected to report lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) already reported a 26% fall in Markets revenues mainly due to a 34% plunge in fixed income trading revenues.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2130,MS,"A steadily growing economy, more confident consumers and record low jobless rate are sure to give banks a lift this Q4 earnings season. These favorable factors will encourage more people to take loans, and with rising interest rates, net interest margins will improve. Reduction in corporate taxes will also boost earnings as banks will be able to retain more of their revenues.But, the Trump administration’s overhaul of the tax law means that banks will have to re-measure the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and consider one-time charges for repatriating overseas earnings. Most of the banking behemoths have already announced such one-time charges associated with the accounting changes that will now have to be made.Nevertheless, let us focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season. Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Loans to GrowThe consumer confidence index is at a historically high level, courtesy of a bullish job market. While the unemployment rate remained at a record low of 4.1%, workers’ pay has increased 2.5% in the December 2016 to December 2017 period, up from 2.4% in the prior month.The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that the minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will reach employee wages closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”All these factors will lend consumers the flexibility to take more debt and also reduce loan default risks, which bode well for banks.Rising Rates for Borrowers, Not SaversAs widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month. The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. In fact, Fed officials expect to hike rates at a steady pace. The median expectation for rate hikes this year is pegged at three — at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020.A move toward higher rates is a welcome news for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. Then again, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.With the Fed hiking rates by a quarter-point, the biggest banks by assets also said that they will do the same to its main lending rate. Millions of credit card holders and small-business borrowers will have to pay more in terms of interest. But, does that mean there will be higher rates in deposits? Certainly not! Rates for savers will remain unchanged, confirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). Thus, the ability to earn more on assets and limit the cost of liabilities to depositors should keep shareholders of U.S. banks cheerful.How Will Banks Deal With Tax Reform?House Republicans passed a monumental bill to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, making it the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates ever.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to around 20%.But, such tax cuts will result in revaluation in deferred tax assets. This in turn will result in one-off hits to banks’ profits. However, even though it may hamper Q4 earnings, shareholders will be much better off over the long term.5 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q4Barring one-time accounting charges, improving consumer sentiment and rise in interest rates will help banks stay afloat this Q4 earnings season. This calls for investing in five banks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q4 earnings.These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP — our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

2133,MS,"With ever changing market dynamics, investors are often lured into undertaking complex investment strategies. But this may not yield the desired results always. Therefore, using conventional strategies based on key fundamentals to select stocks is always a safe and sound approach for ensuring steady returns.Among several rational and down-to-earth investment strategies, we picked one that is focused on the sales growth of a company. Steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business.Flat or declining sales growth shows obstacles at the company, which will limit scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period, but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit temporarily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. So, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation. This metric’s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings.Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not desirable. A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

2134,MS,"Per the announcements made by the European Commission, large foreign investment banks in the European Union (EU) will now face tougher regulatory regime and would be brought under the direct control of the European Central Bank (ECB).Until now, market regulators were responsible for supervising banks, which will now be done by the central bank. In the opinion of the Commission’s vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, ""The new rules will support well-functioning capital markets, while ensuring financial stability. At the same time, larger firms posing similar risks as banks should be regulated and supervised like banks.""The regulatory body is planning to get large institutions that have assets of more than 30 billion euros under stricter regulations and easing the regulations on smaller firms. Thus, banking giants like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse (CS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) might face tighter scrutiny.In fact, all big banks are trying to shift operations outside of Britain so that they can continue serving their customers post Brexit in March 2019 too. However, the ECB has made it clear that they can’t set up small offices in London and keep serving their clients. According to the ECB, the banks will have to maintain full-fledged offices if they want to serve the clients post Brexit.Of the above-mentioned major banks, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2135,MS,"On Tuesday, U.S. banking regulators — the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (“FDIC”) — passed eight largest domestic banking organizations on their ""living wills"" after completing the evaluation of the resolution plans. These banks include Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report).However, both regulatory agencies have found some shortcomings in the plans of four banks out of the eight firms, which can be improved in the next resolution plan. These four globally important banks include BofA, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.""While significant progress has been made... there are inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with the resolution of a systemically important financial institution,"" the regulators noted.Notably, regulators demand improvement in four particular areas, including the management of derivatives, payment, clearing and settlement activities.Previously, in April 2016, resolution plans of five banks out of these eight were deficient, per the agencies.The plan, better known as “living will,” lays out the strategy for a company’s fast resolution under bankruptcy in the event of failure of the company or severe financial stress. Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the banks (with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more) are required to submit living wills. The main objective behind the submission of living will is to avoid re-run of the 2008 financial crisis and reduce risks of further bailouts.A systemic resolution, maximizing the sale value of a failed bank and minimizing creditor losses would help in efficient handling of bank failures. Moreover, the FDIC will have the power to liquidate a bank if its collapse knocks down the country’s financial stability.Notably, all eight firms require their next resolution plans to be submitted by July 1, 2019.Among these banks, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The regulators are working to improvise the resolution planning process. Therefore, it is expected that the submissions of annual resolution plan can be modified to once in two years in order to extend the time to prepare and review the plans.Bottom LineHypothetically, it is easy to say that resolution plans should be made in a way such that these do not adversely affect the overall financial system. However, in practice, it is difficult to mitigate the harm, as banks depend considerably on mutual businesses.Nevertheless, we believe ""Living Wills"" will help the regulators wind up banks, in case of failures, to some extent. Most importantly, the advance precautions will surely entail into lesser involvement of taxpayers’ money for bailing out troubled financial institutions.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2136,MS,"Armed with cost-reduction initiatives and a strengthening balance sheet, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) appears a promising pick right now. Moreover, it is well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment.A positive trend in estimate revisions reflects optimism over the company’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Morgan Stanley’s current-year earnings has moved up marginally over the last 60 days. As a result, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The stock has rallied 23.9% over the past 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.8%.Here’s Why the Stock has More Upside PotentialEarnings Strength: Morgan Stanley recorded an earnings growth rate of 14.6% over the last three to five years compared with 8.7% for the industry. The earnings growth rate for the current and the next year is anticipated to be 22.4% and 12.5%, respectively.Further, over the long term, Morgan Stanley’s earnings are anticipated to grow at the rate of 11.9%.Revenue Growth: The company’s organic growth remains strong. Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% over the last five years (2012-2016). Driven by steady focus on wealth management operations, the top line is expected to increase 8.5% in 2017 against no growth for the industry.Prudent Cost Control: Morgan Stanley launched a company-wide cost savings plan — Project Streamline — to discover and implement considerable infrastructure expense reductions by 2017. The company is on track to achieve its expense-savings target of $1 billion by the end of this year.Impressive Capital Deployment: Morgan Stanley’s capital deployment plan is commendable. Its 2017 capital plan included a 25% dividend hike and $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is likely to be able to sustain this level of capital deployments.Favorable ROE: Morgan Stanley’s return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE of 10.07% compares favorably with the industry’s 9.12% average, implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.Stock Looks Undervalued: Morgan Stanley looks undervalued with respect to its price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The company’s trailing 12-month P/E and P/B ratios of 14.86 and 1.36, respectively, are below the industry averages of 20.98 and 1.69.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the finance space worth a look are Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

2137,MS,"Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD  -  Free Report) recently shelled out $37.6 million to acquire office portfolio in Columbus, OH and Salt Lake City, UT. The move is in sync with the company’s efforts to strengthen its presence in solid U.S. secondary growth markets with credit-worthy tenants.The portfolio consists of two class-A office buildings, aggregating 204,587 square feet of space. This portfolio is entirely leased with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Financing LLC (“MSSBF”) being the anchor tenant leasing 92% of the space. The weighted average lease term of the portfolio is 8.6 years. Notably, MSSBF is a major U.S. operating subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report).The three-story, 102,559 square-foot office building in Columbus is 84% leased to MSSBF, while the rest is occupied by privately-owned commercial bank — Congressional Bank. It is situated near Columbus’ I-270 beltway loop in the Easton submarket. On the other hand, the three-story, 102,028 square-foot office building in Salt Lake City is entirely leased to MSSBF. This building is close to the I-15 Freeway and a light rail station.Both properties are in locations with live/work/play amenities and are likely to enjoy decent demand from office tenants, going forward. In fact, such locations reduce the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, properties in such locations enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States.As such for Gladstone Commercial, which is focused on acquiring, owning and operating net leased industrial and office properties across the United States, this acquisition is likely to be accretive to its earnings and drive long-term growth.Shares of Gladstone Commercial have outperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 10.8%, while the industry recorded growth of 4.3% during this time frame.Better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Franklin Street Properties (FSP  -  Free Report), Columbia Property Trust (CXP  -  Free Report) and Select Income REIT (SIR  -  Free Report). All three carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Franklin Street Properties’ Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2017 FFO per share remained unchanged at $1.05 over the past month. Its share price has ascended 9.8% in three months’ time.Columbia Property Trust’s FFO per share estimates for the current year have moved up 2.7% to $1.15 in a month’s time. Its shares have gained 6.6% over the past three months.Select Income REIT’s FFO per share estimates for 2017 remained unchanged at $2.70 over the past month.

2138,MS,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) initiatives to cut down expenses should keep supporting its bottom-line growth. Also, it remains focused on strengthening its product portfolio.Moreover, the company’s price performance looks impressive. Its shares have increased 23.9% in the past year, outpacing the industry’s growth of 14.3%.However, declining net interest income and slump in trading activities remain major concerns for the company.Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has also remained stable over the last 30 days. As a result, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company is on track to reduce infrastructure expenses by 2017 through its cost-saving initiative, Project Streamline.Moreover, for the past few years, the company has been taking a spate of initiatives to restructure its operations with the aim of lowering balance sheet risk and focusing on its less capital-intensive businesses. Its continued focus on strengthening its product portfolio is expected to support top-line growth in the quarters ahead.Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company should be able to sustain improved capital deployments and continue enhancing shareholder value going forward.However, the company’s net-interest income has started to witness a decline since the beginning of 2017. Despite a favorable rate environment and improving economy, the decline in net-interest income is a result of significant increase in interest expenses.Also, a major portion of Morgan Stanley’s revenues comes from trading activities and hence its performance is largely dependent on the overall performance of the capital markets. Since the beginning of 2017, there has been a slowdown in client activity and low market volatility, which has led to a decline in fixed income trading revenues. If the slump in capital markets continues, it will adversely affect the company’s trading income.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR  -  Free Report), Stifel Financial Corporation (SF  -  Free Report) and Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

With that said, growth-minded investors are likely still on the hunt for new stocks and the tech sector is a great place to start.The likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) rightfully garner a lot of attention as their rapid growth has helped spur the rise of technology stocks. But even the most causal of readers know about these giants.For investors looking to find growth in the tech sector outside of putting their money in the biggest names, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) could be a good place to start.The U.S. tech company manufactures and sells data storage devices and hard drives. The memory and computer storage industry that Western Digital operates in is only set to grow as the amount of data companies and people use grows exponentially.Now, let’s look at what makes Western Digital a great growth stock.Growth Fundamentals Western Digital, which develops and manufactures data storage devices for both personal and corporate use is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The company was in the news on Monday after its stock price fell nearly 7%. The movement came after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) lowered its Western Digital rating from overweight to equal weight. Morgan Stanley’s downgrade also included other computer memory and NAND flash memory firms and cited future prices as a reason for the downgrade.Before today’s decline, shares of Western Digital had soared 36.54% in 2017. What’s more, the company has already fought its way back from a major 2015 downturn.

For its full fiscal year, Western Digital’s earnings are set to hit $13.17 per share, which would mark a 43.30% year-over-year gain.In terms of growth, Western Digital’s current cash flow rests at 96%, which crushed the “Computer – Storage Devices” industry’s 2.79% average decline. On top of that, the company’s historic cash flow—the last 3-5 years, annualized—sits at 11.68%, beating its industry’s average, and helps to show that the company has been growing its cash position in recent years.Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteFor investors skeptical that Western Digital will be able to match or beat our current consensus estimates for revenue and earnings, the company has met or topped out estimates in seven of the last eight quarters. Lastly, for investors concerned that Western Digital might only be a growth play, the company also currently rocks an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, helping it earn an overall “A” VGM score. Western Digital is currently trading at just 7.06x earnings, which marks a 50% discount compared to its industry’s average.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2140,MS,"In an interview with a French newspaper, Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that the bank would base its European operations in Frankfurt and Paris post Britain’s planned exit from the bloc in 2019.He said that it would be upon the employees to decide which location they would relocate to. Blankfein also mentioned that the bank would need to hire more employees.Britain is currently home to most of Goldman’s European operations, with about 6,000 employees.Goldman has leased office space in a Frankfurt skyscraper that would enable it to hire about 1,000 people, significantly higher than the present employee count in office at Frankfurt. The bank already has office spaces in central Paris.Being home to the European Central Bank, Frankfurt has been a preferred choice of U.S. companies like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) for base establishment of European operations.Meanwhile, Paris President Emmanuel Macron’s measures to lower taxes and cut red tape for international bankers have appealed to banks like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report).Other banks await updates on how things turn out between the Brexit negotiators.

Per a recent report by GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives, as quoted by Investors Business Daily, iPhone X cycle could help Apple reach the milestone figure as early as next year.Apart from iPhone X, the analyst adds that the fast booming Services business and the rebound witnessed in China could propel Apple to new highs. A cash pile of $250 billion could help Apple make strategic acquisitions (Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla and the rumors go on) and carry on with its gigantic shareholder return plan.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc.

2142,MS,"A lawsuit has been filed in Manhattan federal court against a few Wall Street banks, claiming that traders at such banks collaborated with each other to manipulate auctions of the $14 trillion US Treasury bond market. The malpractice helped banks earn more at the cost of their clients.This lawsuit is an extension of the class-action suit filed earlier in 2015 by several pension funds and wealthy individual investors. This new lawsuit claims that dealers at several banks secretly shared their client information in online chat rooms to rig auctions of the bond markets.The banks that have been accused are The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS  -  Free Report), UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and some others. Per the lawsuit, the manipulative practices by these banks were carried on for a period of almost eight years, between 2007 and 2015.The above-mentioned banks are primary dealers in the bond markets. In order to sell debt to their clients, they first purchase it directly from the Treasury. Notably, the debt is sold to clients at a pre-determined price.There is an auction that is conducted by the Treasury. Banks need to submit their bids for the bonds. The bids depend on how much their investor or clients want and the price they are willing to pay. Once the bids are submitted, the Treasury proportionately allots the bonds to the banks. The bank that asks for the best price gets the maximum number of bonds.Now, how much the investors want and at what price are confidential. Banks are not allowed to disclose such information.However, the lawsuit claims that traders at these banks secretly shared their client interest, thereby giving other banks a clear picture of the overall demand and supply in the market. By doing so, each of the banks involved in the auction got a better chance to get a bigger share of the auction and hence sell the bonds at a higher price to earn more profit at the cost of their investors.In order to get a proper understanding of the subject, probes are being conducted by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal, state and overseas regulators. However, so far, none of the banks have been officially accused of any wrongdoing.Also, none of the accused banks has commented anything yet.Of the above mentioned banks, Royal Bank of Scotland currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2144,MS,"Last week, First Horizon National Corporation (FHN  -  Free Report), headquartered at Tennessee, announced the final merger terms of the acquisition of Charlotte, N.C.-based Capital Bank Financial Corp. First Horizon acquired Capital Bank for a total value of $2.2 billion, forming the fourth largest regional bank in the Southeast, effective Nov 30, 2017.Final Terms of the DealPer the deal, each common shareholder of Capital Bank has been converted into the right to receive either 2.1732 of First Horizon shares or $40.573 in cash for every Capital Bank share held, subject to certain conditions. The deal has been agreed upon 80% stock and 20% cash.Following the allocation provisions, around 10.1 million shares of Capital Bank were converted into the right to receive cash amount, while the remaining shares were converted into the right to receive shares of First Horizon common stock. Notably, 42% shareholders of Capital Bank had elected for cash, while the remaining shareholders opted for share conversion or no election.Further, shareholders who opted for cash will receive 46.12% of the merger consideration in cash and the remaining 53.88% in First Horizon common stock. Additionally, shareholders who opted for stock or made no election will receive the merger consideration only in the form of First Horizon common stock, along with cash for fractional shares, based on the closing price of $18.67 per share of First Horizon.After Effects of the DealFirst Horizon, with $30 billion in assets, and Capital Bank, with $10 billion in assets, created the combined entity with $40 billion in assets, $32 billion in deposits and $27 billion in loans. The high potential market in North Carolina, along with the strong relationships that Capital Bank has built in the area, seems to have prompted First Horizon to opt for this acquisition. The deal certainly fortifies First Horizon’s footprint in the Southeast, with about 350 branches in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas and Virginia.According to the terms of the deal, First Horizon will maintain its First Tennessee bank brand in Tennessee, while the Capital Bank name will be used for branches outside Tennessee.Barclays Capital Inc., a unit of Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley & Co.

The company decided to exit these business lines and focus on growing the core Tennessee banking franchise.The company’s repositioning and restructuring efforts, which are still underway, help it reallocate capital into core markets. Also, its focus on cost control and efforts to boost long-term profitability are anticipated to augur well.Such moves have caused investors to become optimistic about First Horizon's growth opportunities.

2146,MS,"Bitcoin is steadily gaining popularity, as reflected by its rising user base. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization of $160.8 billion, per coinmarketcap.com, is nearly double the valuation of Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), at a respective $89.2 billion and $88.8 billion.Investors should know that the surge in online retail transactions, especially in the holiday season, is driving bitcoin beyond the $9000 mark. This primarily reflects bitcoin’s growing acceptance in diverse businesses.A Note on BitcoinBitcoin is not a physical coin and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems, and thereby keeps the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currency as rewards.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsAround Thanksgiving, the virtual currency market witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders. From Nov 22 to Nov 24, Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — added roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency.Per Coinbase data and Alistair Milne, the bitcoin exchange currently has as many as 13.1 million users, way higher than the 4.9 million users recorded last November. The digital currency also touched an all-time high of $9,682.10 on Nov 27.It is to be noted that with an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we expect more transactions that will need more mining. New businesses associated with mining have emerged and companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offer digital mining equipment are in high demand. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Holiday Retail Transaction Drives BitcoinCNBC stated that retail transactions this holiday session supported the cryptocurrency’s year-to-date increase of more than 850%. CME Group Inc.’s (CME  -  Free Report) plan to launch bitcoin futures also supported the rally. CME Group — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the second week of December, media reports claim.Apart from holiday retail-centric growth, many investors prefer bitcoin, given that no more than 21 million of the virtual currency can be mined. The finite resource base of the cryptocurrency could help investors increase their wealth over time.Companies Going the Bitcoin WayMany businesses across countries are opting for bitcoin as a mode of transaction, driving the popularity of the currency. Here we discuss four companies that allow their customers to pay in bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is among the leading online travel players in the world. Per media report, since June 2014, the travel agency has been offering its customers the option to pay in bitcoins for booking hotels.We expect Expedia, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 4.1% in 2017.DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report), headquartered in Englewood, CO, operates the DISH Network direct broadcast satellite (DBS) subscription television service in the United States. In August 2014, the company received bitcoin payment from customers for the first time.The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3% for the last four quarters. Presently, DISH carries a Zacks Rank #3.Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. The company is accepting payments in bitcoin.We expect this Zacks #3 Ranked company to post year-over-year earnings growth of 12.1% in fiscal 2018.Based in Midvale, UT, Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) is a leading online retail player. Since January 2014, the company has been accepting bitcoin for its wide range of products, including laptops and televisions.Overstock.com carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2147,MS,"Per a recent report by Reuters, Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) is mulling over the sale of its Qdoba Mexican Grill brand to a private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, LLC (APO  -  Free Report).The firm has reportedly offered more than $300 million for the restaurant chain.Why Qdoba?Qdoba is the one of the leading fast-casual Mexican brands in the United States. Ever since its acquisition in 2003 for $45 million, the brand has been helping Jack in the Box enhance core growth and balance the risks associated with the highly competitive hamburger segment of the QSR industry. It has also enhanced the company’s geographic presence and drove the top line.However, poor restaurant level execution and a choppy sales environment have been denting sales at the Qdoba brand of late. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, comps at the company-owned Qdoba restaurants declined 2.7% as against a 1.8% increase in the first nine months of 2016. System-wide comps at the brand also declined 1.2% in the same time frame as compared with a 1.6% increase in the year-ago level.Moreover, the company’s valuation was negatively impacted for sometime as it had to simultaneously run two business models for Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants and Qdoba Mexican Grill fast-casual restaurants.Given this scenario, management has been considering alternatives for the Qdoba brand and has retained Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) for the same.Bottom LineNotably, an activist hedge fund Jana Partners recently took over a $1.3-million stake in Jack in the Box. Filings also revealed that Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value invested in the company in the last quarter. Meanwhile, the restaurant space has seen the signing of quite a few deals in the recent months owing to a choppy sales environment and stiff competition. The activist hedge funds therefore, by buying stakes in the restaurants, compel them to turn around their business operations.In fact, shortly after Jana Partners had urged Whole Foods Market, Inc. to consider a sell-off, the company was taken over by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).  Hence this hedge fund is likely to encourage Jack in the Box toward a change.Meanwhile, Jack in the Box’s shares have widely underperformed its industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has lost 9.2% as against the industry’s gain of 11.1%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have also moved down 2.2% and 0.2%, respectively, raising doubts over the stock’s upside potential. Notably, the deal might get finalized next week. It is to be seen how the merger, on completion, works for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

2148,MS,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB) recently issued a list of 30 global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The list comprises names of large banks with extensive global presence whose failure can rattle the global economy.These banks are required to meet the board’s total loss-absorbing capacity standard, which is a measure of the capital these banks need to hold in order to avoid the need for bailouts. They are also segregated into buckets, depending on the extra capital required.Per the list, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) has been regarded as the most dangerous of the 30 banks and is required to hold an extra 2.5% capital. It is the sole bank in the second most critical bucket, with no bank in the top tier.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) moved down to join Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report) which remain in the third bucket. This implies that these banks need to hold 2% extra capital.The next level, which needs banks to have a capital buffer of 1.5%, consists of eight banks. While Credit Suisse (CS  -  Free Report) has been moved down from this bucket, two Chinese banks — Bank of China  and China Construction Bank  have been raised to this rank.The final bucket consists of names such as Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report). The addition of Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report) to the list in place of Groupe BPCE has been a major change.Royal Bank of Canada announced that it meets the required 1% of additional capital and thus does not expect any effect on its capital position.The FSB was established after the 2008 crisis to protect the markets from another shock. Banks on the list are supposed to comply with the additional capital requirement effective Jan 1, 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2149,MS,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) climbed on Monday morning after CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would unveil its first ever electric semi-truck later this week.Musk made it known via Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report)—where he has amassed nearly 15 million followers—that Tesla will officially show off its new all-electric semi-truck to an audience in Hawthorne, California on Thursday, Nov. 16.Tesla Semi Truck unveil to be webcast live on Thursday at 8pm! This will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension. Just need to find my portal gun ...— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 12, 2017The joke-filled tweet is only the latest in a series of posts related to Tesla’s first foray into commercial vehicles. Musk first announced on Twitter in September that the “Tesla Semi truck unveil & test ride tentatively scheduled for Oct 26th in Hawthorne.” He then continued, “worth seeing this beast in person. It's unreal.”The initial announcement helped lift Tesla’s stock price as investors were energized by the idea of another revenue stream and possible long-term shake-up of the massive trucking industry.However, Tesla’s CEO took to Twitter to let everyone know that the company changed the official semi-truck reveal date to mid-November, citing humanitarian reasons.Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017The electric vehicle giant’s semi will reportedly have an initial range of 200 to 300 miles before needing to be recharged. Current diesel trucks can travel 1,000 miles or more on a single tank of gas. This likely means Tesla’s electric trucks will be confined to more localized routes upon their launch.Demand for the Tesla semi-trucks will be high, according to Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) analyst Ravi Shanker. For now, however, details surrounding how much Tesla will charge for the new electric semis is unclear. It is also uncertain when the trucks will go into production or when they will be available for purchase.Initial estimates for the semi truck seem to vary. Cowen analyst Jeffery Osborne doesn’t expect production of the electric semis to start until at least 2021, while analysts at Morgan Stanley note that they project semi-truck sales will start in 2020.Nonetheless, shares of Tesla popped on Monday morning after Musk’s Sunday tweet began to make the rounds. The positive news might help investors look past the fact that production of the company’s mass-market Model 3 sedan has failed to meet expectations, which helped Tesla remain highly unprofitable in its third-quarter.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2150,MS,"Bitcoin is one of the most popular cyrptocurrencies on the market, primarily backed by a rising user base. According to coinmarketcap.com, the market capitalization of the currency presently stands at more than $124.5 billion, much higher than the stock market valuation of  both Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which sit at $94.6 billion and $91.9 billion, respectively.Also, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin has outclassed the S&P 500 index. From $963.66 on Jan 1, the price of bitcoin has risen more than 600% against only 15.7% for the S&P 500. Thus, it is the right time for investors to add stocks that have a positive correlation with the virtual currency.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsThe virtual currency market has witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders after CME Group Inc. (CME) — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced its intention to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the October-to-December quarter of 2017.Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — has roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency, per Alistair Milne. Coinbase added that as of now, it has as many as 11.9 million users. Also, CME Group’s plan to launch bitcoin futures pushed the virtual currency to its highest mark of $7,454.04 on Nov 3.Mining Demand RisesWith an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we are expecting more transactions that will need more mining. Transactions refer to transferring value between the customer’s bitcoin wallets, while mining specifies the process through which all the transactions will get verified and processed.Investors should know that bitcoin is not a physical coin, and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems and thereby keeping the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currencies as rewards. That is how bitcoin operates. Which Stocks Will Benefit?New businesses associated to mining have emerged and companies offering digital mining equipment are in high demand. Miners require advanced hardware to solve more complex problems. Hence, the need for computer processors and chips used by miners for creating bitcoin have surged. Companies producing these chips are now in high demand, and investing in such stocks will be a smart option. Four stocks in particular are poised to gain the most on the bitcoin price surge, per Bloomberg. All the stocks also carry a solid Zacks Rank. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) primarily provides microprocessors (x86-based), chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics.

The memory chips, among the most important parts of mining rig, will be useful for miners said Stifel Nicolaus, an investment banking firm.The #1 ranked stock also has an excellent earnings surprise history. Micron beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings in the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 10.98%.Based in Santa Clara, CA, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductor products. The company’s innovative efforts are speeding up the entire computer, and not just the central processing unit (CPU), which is helpful for the miners.

2151,MS,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Monday following reports from Bloomberg that the House was considering a ‘gradual phasing-in’ of corporate tax rates. This hurt investor sentiment and caused broad based losses for the markets. Market watchers also awaited the announcement of the next Fed Chief, whose name President Trump is expected to reveal on Thursday. Meanwhile, markets also suffered after Paul Manafort was convicted in the Russian meddling case.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,348.74, losing 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.3% to close at 2,572.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,701.26, decreasing 0.03%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,469 to 1,308. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1,625 to 1,049. The CBOE VIX increased 4.6% to close at 10.25.Benchmarks Post LossesThe Dow declined 85.5 points to end the session with losses. The blue-chip index was weighed down by a decline in the shares of Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), shares of which declined 6.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Merck suffered its biggest two-day decline following reports that it had withdrawn its application seeking approval for the usage of its cancer immunotherapy drug in Europe.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended in the red, with healthcare stocks leading the decliners. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) dipped 1.1% on Monday, posting its worst one-day dip since Aug 17. Moreover, a decline in the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) led the S&P 500 lower.While, shares of AMD declined after some analysts from Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) commented that demand for cryptocurrency mining chips will be reduced almost 50%, shares of GM plunged after analysts from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) downgraded the stock to sell.House Proposes ‘Gradual Phase-in’ of Corporate TaxesReports from Bloomberg surfaced on Monday that legislators from the House  who are involved in the formulation of the new tax code were considering a possible ‘phasing-in’ of the corporate tax-rate cut. This would effectively reduce the current rate of corporate tax — at 35% — to 20% by 2022. However, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady commented that the procedure is still under review and there has not been any formal decision on it.The guidelines of the proposal state that tax rates would be slashed by three percentage points each year, beginning in 2018. The economists have clearly stated that if such a framework is adopted it would not only become less effective but would also delay any economic effects that President Trump and his aides aim to achieve. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a press meeting, commented that Trump wants to immediately slash the tax rates.Such news led to losses for the Russell 2000 index which declined 1.2% to post its worst single-day decline since Aug 17.Investor sentiment was also hurt after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States for an alleged Russian meddling in 2016 Presidential elections. Meanwhile, investors also eagerly wait to know as to whom Trump would choose as the next Fed Chief. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday.Economic DataOn the economic data front, personal income for the month of September increased 0.4%, up from 0.2% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was also 0.4%. On the other hand, the consumer spending surged 1%, more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 0.8%. This marks its highest level in almost 8 years. Such a rally can be attributed to the fact that the residents of hurricane ravaged Texas and Florida replaced their flood-damaged automobiles. Economists believe that this would have only a short term effect on consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Core PCE inflation for September increased 0.1%, in line with the consensus estimate.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnder Armour Q3 Earnings Top, Stock Tanks on View CutUnder Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) reported mixed quarterly numbers in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

2152,MS,"President Trump’s plans of massive tax cuts and reforms cleared a critical hurdle with the Senate passing a budget blueprint of trillions of dollars for fiscal 2018. This has paved the way for the Republicans to pursue the much awaited tax-cut reform without Democratic support. After all, both American households and corporates have borne the burden of an unfair tax code for quite some time.The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates will put more money in individual’s pockets, while it will be a shot in the arm for financial as well as tech majors that have parked a lot of cash overseas. The cash held overseas will be brought back to avail the lower domestic rate, prompting a slew of new deals. This in turn will fuel innovation, organic growth and earnings.Repatriation of billions of dollars also strengthens the economy causing the federal funds rate to move north, which bodes well for both banking and non-banking financial organizations. Thus, let us invest in multinational financial and information technology service providers, as well as computer makers that can make the most from the lowering of corporate tax rate.Senate Republicans Push Through Budget ProposalSenate Republicans successfully passed a $4-trillion budget blueprint in federal outlays by a 51-to-49 vote. The Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget measure, with GOP senator Rand Paul of Kentucky voting against it. This has set the stage for Republicans to begin ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code as early as this year, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses globally more competitive.After repeatedly failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, the GOP lawmakers were under tremendous pressure to deliver on tax reforms that they had promised in the election campaign. The Senate’s passage of the budget blueprint has unlocked a special parliamentary procedure that will help Republicans cut $1.5 trillion in taxes with just 50 votes. A typical Senate procedure requires 60 votes to bypass the threat of a filibuster.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell supported the budget and said that it was “critical to getting tax reform done;” while President Trump added that it is “an important step in advancing the Administration’s pro-growth and pro-jobs legislative agenda.”President Trump, in the meantime, had a tough message for House Republicans. They need to work on the tax reform and pass the Senate’s budget this week or face bloodbath next year. House Speaker Paul Ryan had already told his members that he wants tax reform enacted by this year, and approving the revised Senate budget this week gives the best shot to get it done within that timeframe.Banks Set to Gain From Trump’s Sweeping Tax CutsIt’s no wonder that bank’s profitability will be enhanced by the proposed tax cuts. The corporate tax rate is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%.The slashing of domestic tax rate will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This will, ultimately, boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Non-banking financial institutions including insurance companies, asset managers and brokerage firms should also benefit. Rising rates act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should gain from a higher rate environment.Brokerage firms and asset managers also advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions From Trump’s Tax Plan Tax cuts will make tech majors bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will encourage such companies to carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Oracle Corporation hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.Top 5 GainersBanking on such positives, investing in sound multinational companies from the aforesaid sectors will be a prudent choice.

2154,MS,"Several tech mega caps are poised to report quarterly results on ‘Super Thursday’. Despite being near record highs, computer and software companies remain trusted choices for traders. This fails to surprise as Trump administration’s initiative to trim tax rates is providing the much-needed windfall to such companies that have mostly hoarded money outside the United States.Let us, thus, focus on the quarterly results of FAAMG shares — a Wall Street acronym for Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), which are mostly responsible for the stellar performance of tech stocks this year.While Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon’s results will be out on Oct 26, Facebook and Apple’s earnings releases are slated for next week.Tech Investors Gear Up for Earnings on ‘Super Thursday’Tech stocks are already trading at record highs, with Amazon, in particular, having touched the $1000-a-share level this year. Banking behemoth Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report)  added that the world fund manager’s survey for October noted that “long Nasdaq”, the tech-heavy stock index, is the most popular trade for the fifth time this year.The Nasdaq 100 index, in fact, has rallied around 25% on a year-to-date basis, having hit a record high last week. Also, its price-to-earnings ratio is at the highest level since the dotcom bubble. The S&P 500 tech sector’s forward price-to-earnings ratio climbed to 18.9 from 16.2 at the beginning of this year.So, are the valuations too rosy? It’s possible that traders are gathering Internet and tech companies on the prospect of upbeat Q3 earnings. Tech companies’ earnings for the said quarter are expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues. Also, 30 days into the start of the Q3 earnings season, the tech sector has gained an average 4.6% in the last 19 years, way higher than the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.3%, as per hedge fund analytics tool Kensho.Notably, Q3 earnings are expected to garner strength on Trump’s promises to deliver historic tax reliefs.  Trump’s intentions to lower the U.S. tax code will help tech stocks bring back cash held overseas to the United States. Tech stocks have stashed around $2.4 trillion overseas which could be used for buying back shares, paying dividends and clearing debts.Needless to say, growth in cloud computing and Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggests that the good times for techs are here to stay.Banking on such bullish trends, money managers are keeping an eye on the FAAMG shares that helped tech come a long way from the dot-com fiasco. After all, the tech sector has surged 31% so far this year, comfortably beating healthcare, the next best performer.FAAMG Stocks’ Earnings PreviewShares of Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon have recorded gains of 25% to 30% so far this year. When Alphabet reports its Q3 results, a steady uptick in traffic acquisition cost will be a concern for investors. After all, the cost was up 28% in Q2, more than the 23% increase in revenues from Google sites. Among other bottlenecks, rise in capital outlays and regulatory pressure building in Europe might impede its shares’ upward trajectory.But, there are positive developments like robust growth in mobile search and YouTube advertising, which may provide momentum on the revenue front. Higher investment spending, in the meanwhile, is likely to boost earnings per share (read more: 3 Key Estimates for Google's Q3 Earnings Report).Microsoft’s fiscal first-quarter earnings are dependent on its cloud business as its Azure and Office 365 services continue to gain momentum. Commercial cloud revenues are expected to rise by as much as 51% to $4.9 billion for the tech company in the quarter, as per Credit Suisse Group AG CS).Microsoft also, successfully, countered the declining PC market banking on its new Surface Pro. With stability in the cloud and Windows business, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) believes that Microsoft’s revenues will spring back to double-digit growth next year for the first time since 2014 (read more: 3 Key Estimates for Microsoft's Q1 Earnings Report).Both Alphabet and Microsoft have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, the world's most customer-centric company, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of Amazon declined nearly 7% from the preceding quarter as the company’s profits were hampered by increased investments in areas ranging from film production to warehouses.The e-commerce giant is expected to double down on its investments before the holiday season, which may eventually affect its bottom line in Q3 (read more: Amazon’s Q3 Earnings to be Hurt by Heavy Investments).2 Solid BuysInvestors, in fact, should raise their bets on Facebook and Apple. Facebook, in particular, is expected to score big in Q3, courtesy of an increase in ad revenues. A Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report) research showed that the Internet giant will see a 47% year-over-year increase in ad revenues in Q3. If that happens, the company will be able to beat analysts’ predictions again.Facebook’s mobile and live video efforts continue to pay off, with Instagram emerging as an important revenue stream. Apart from mobile and video, the monetization opportunities of the company’s other subsidiaries – Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus – coupled with a huge user base are expected to drive growth. Facebook is also experimenting with AR/VR and AI technologies, which bodes well for long-term growth.Currently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings advanced 2.1% over the last 60 days. It is expected to report earnings for the quarter ending September on Nov 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Facebook’s expected growth rate for the current year is 26.5%, higher than the industry’s estimated growth of 14.8%. The company has outperformed the Internet services market on a year-to-date basis (+48.3% vs +25%).Coming to Apple, management expects growth in iPhone revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter. The world’s most valuable publicly-traded company’s enriched product portfolio, which now includes Watch 3 and 4K TV, will also help its shares gain momentum. The company’s $1-billion investment for acquiring original content and its plan to foray into the film distribution market will boost revenues further.Right now, the company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 1.6% in the last 90 days. It is expected to report its latest quarterly earnings on Nov 2.Apple’s growth rate for the current year is projected to rise 8.4%, higher than the industry’s estimated growth of 2.1%. The company has outperformed the computers & mini computers market on a year-to-date basis (+35.1% vs +34.6%).Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.  See the pot trades we're targeting>>

2155,MS,"Good news is here, investing friends! Q3 earnings results are not only clear and present, but results are better than expected among most household name stocks ahead of the bell this morning. In a quarter rife with stresses from the nation’s capital, natural disasters both here and abroad, and other stock market headwinds, stronger-than-expected earnings are providing a good tonic for us this morning.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) tore the cover off the ball, figuratively speaking. The Wall Street investment giant easily surpassed top and bottom-line estimates: $5.02 per share beat the $4.31 expected, and revenues of $8.3 billion topped the $7.6 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. This was also higher than the $8.2 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter. This marks the fourth quarter in the last five that Goldman Sachs has beaten earnings estimates, for a 4-quarter trailing average of 11.6%.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and revenues: the investment bank’s top line brought in $9.2 billion, versus the $9.0 billion expected, on earnings per share of 93 cents — easily outpacing the 81 cents anticipated. Investment banking revenues, in particular, grew 18.4% in the company’s Q3.Household products giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a solid dime to $1.90 per share, as top-line results also came in above expectations: $19.65 billion versus $19.28 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for fiscal 2017 was also raised. Pharma sales in the quarter grew an impressive 15.4%.For its fifth straight earnings beat (at least), United Healthcare (UNH  -  Free Report) also posted a positive surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: $2.66 per share bested the $2.57 expected. Revenues of $50.3 billion in the quarter rose 8.7% year over year on growth in medical enrollment.On the other side of the street, Harley Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) illustrated some of the difficulties in today’s market, just meeting the 40 cents per share expected in the Zacks consensus, down 40% from year-ago results. Sales of $962.1 million did top the $960.8 million expected, but these numbers are both down from the $1.1 billion reported in Q3 2016. Baby boomers buying fewer bikes looks to be the culprit here; in related news, Peter Fonda is 77 years old.New Import/Export NumbersSeptember results for both import and export prices beat expectations this morning, up 0.7% last month from the 0.6% consensus, as well as the unrevised headline from the previous month. Exports performed even better, up 0.8% as opposed to the +0.5% expected. Imports year over year are in-line at +1.9%, while exports are +2.7% since this time last year. More grist for the interest rate hike mill. You know the Fed is paying attention to this.

2157,MS,"Impressive performance of wealth management division and higher investment banking fees drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 93 cents per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The reported figure was 15% above the prior-year quarter.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained nearly 1.7% in pre-market trading, largely driven by impressive investment banking performance. The stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Higher underwriting fees (up 19%), stable equity trading income and an increase in advisory fees (up 10%) were largely responsible for the significant improvement in earnings. Also, the company’s capital ratios remained strong.However, as expected, fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) income declined (down 21%). Further, lower net interest income and a rise in operating expenses were the undermining factors.Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.8 billion, up 12% year over year.Rise in Investment Banking Aids Revenues, Costs RiseNet revenues amounted to $9.2 billion, a rise of 3% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9 billion.Net interest income was $783 million, down 22% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely due to a drastic rise in interest expenses. However, total non-interest revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year over year, primarily supported by improvement in investments.Total non-interest expenses were $6.7 billion, up 3% year over year. The rise was due to a 2% increase in compensation and benefits costs as well as 9% jump in other expenses.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, down 11% year over year. Net revenues of $4.4 billion fell 4% from the prior-year quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower FICC income, partially offset by increase in underwriting income and advisory revenues as well as stable equity trading revenues.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, a jump of 24% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenues were $4.2 billion, up 9% year over year, driven by higher asset management fee revenues, net interest income and transactional revenues.Investment Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $131 million, jumping 35% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenues were $675 million, a rise of 22% year over year. The increase reflected higher investment revenues and asset management fees.As of Sep 30, 2017, total assets under management or supervision were $447 billion, up 7% on a year-over-year basis.Strong Capital PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, book value per share was $38.87, up from $37.11 as of Sep 30, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $33.86, up from $32.13 as of Sep 30, 2016.Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 capital ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 19.8%, up from 18.9% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 common equity ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 17.4% compared with 16.8% in the prior-year quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley bought back around 27 million shares for nearly $1.25 billion. This was part of the company's 2017 capital plan.Our TakeMorgan Stanley’s initiatives to offload its non-core assets in order to lower balance-sheet risks and shift focus toward less capital-incentive operations like wealth management are commendable. Further, steady improvement in investment banking income will support its top line.However, continued decline in interest income despite an improving rate scenario remains a near-term concern for Morgan Stanley. Also, decline in bond trading fees owing to low client activity is an issue.Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteCurrently, Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2159,MS,"Solid second-quarter earnings provided a fillip to the U.S. equity market despite political turmoil both at home and abroad. A similar shot in the arm is expected in the third quarter, with American corporations showing signs of strength on the back of an improving economy.Both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace in September, while the U.S. economy is growing close to the range expected by President Trump and some other Republicans. A clearer view of last month’s labor market data shows that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten.The third-quarter earnings season, unofficially, begins mid-October. It is seen as the biggest catalyst for the broader markets that could help major indices continue their winning streak. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season. Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price, which eventually enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts (read more: 5 Top Large-Cap Earnings Growth Stocks to Buy Now).Q3 Earnings OutlookEarnings have been pretty strong so far this year. Earnings growth in both the first and second quarter for the S&P 500 companies was in double-digits. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) expects such companies to top forecasts in the third quarter as well, which will take the S&P 500 closer to the 2,575 mark by the end of October. The benchmark index is currently trading at around the 2,544 mark. Morgan Stanley’s forecast would mean additional gains of 1.2% by the end of the month. Further, the banking giant expects the broader gauge to end the year at around 2,700.Total third-quarter earnings are expected to be up 2.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues. Expectations of earnings may not be excessively high, but, still looks solid as economic indicators shows positive signs.  Strong Economic BackdropA key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13-year high in September, while non-manufacturing activity rallied to a 12-year high. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. The non-manufacturing gauge was at 59.8% last month, as compared with 55.3% in the prior month (read more: U.S. Manufacturing Activity Hits 13-Year High: Top 5 Winners).      Additionally, U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investments drove the upside.September jobs report, in the meanwhile, showed the first monthly decline in payrolls in seven years. Investors, however, mostly ignored the surprise contraction which was led by unprecedented events such as hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Let’s not forget that even during such trying times, the unemployment rate remained at a 16-year low and wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.Potential Gainers & Losers of Q3             The energy sector, in particular, is expected to record the strongest growth in the third quarter. Total earnings for the sector are expected to grow a whopping 121.9% on 17.2% higher revenues. The energy sector is benefitting from an uptick in oil prices, which is gaining strength as demand is strong in Europe and the United States. Needless to say, the oil market has been suffering owing to oversupply concerns for quite some time now.As per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand grew by 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. The IEA also revised the growth estimate for this year upward to 1.6 million bpd.Earnings for the technology sector are set to grow 9.7% from the same period last year. Substantial growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics are cited to be some of the reasons that have boosted the sector in recent times.Improved chances of some form of tax reform making it through the house also benefitted the technology sector. Tech behemoths like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas. The tax plan seeks to encourage such multinationals to bring those profits back to the United States by cutting the tax rate.Industrials sector, in the meanwhile, is expected to rise in mid-single digits. High profits are also expected from conglomerates and construction segments as well. But, bank earnings are expected to disappoint mostly due to persistent deceleration in loan growth and soft trading revenues. Total third-quarter earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry is expected to be down 5.1% from the same period last year on 2.2% higher revenues (read more: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?).The table below shows what is expected from the different sectors in Q3, compared with what was achieved in the preceding quarter.(Source: Zacks Investment Research Inc.)(Date as of: October 6, 2017)Buy These 5 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthA very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of positive earnings growth in the third quarter.

2160,MS,"Monday, September 18, 2017This week brings us the latest Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) two-day meeting, where Fed presidents from regions across the U.S. meet with Fed Chair Janet Yellen to discuss and decide on monetary policy. The participants convene tomorrow, and by Wednesday afternoon we look forward to a press conference with Yellen regarding any changes being made.Literally no one expects another rate hike this time around, but most analysts are looking toward a table set for unwinding the Fed’s $4.5 trillion on its balance sheet. Formerly, some had expected interest rates to rise further before the unwinding program was to begin; language used by the Fed in its recent meetings, however, give a clearer indication of how important the Fed members find this unwinding to be.There is an entire cottage industry dedicated to parsing phrases and changes to previous statements the Fed makes, and this week there is new material many will be interested in seeing whether the Fed will draw from. In short, these new findings are calling the current market among the most expensive — if not the most expensive — in history. A prominent strategist at Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) points out that an equal-weighted bond/equity portfolio has never been pricier. Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) Ruchir Sharma points out this is the first time we see all assets — from housing to stocks to bonds — at their highest levels of expense simultaneously.According to other reports, the market is valued at four times the real economy. We appear to be at stretching points seen in both 2000 and 2007 — the years directly preceding the two most recent major market crashes. And if it stands to reason that bubbles risks increase the longer low interest rates exist, then we may at very least see more of the Fed’s conversation take up this subject. Will the Fed begin to focus more on financial stability than merely its dual mandate of low unemployment and manageable inflation?One half of that dual mandate has been met for awhile now, but the other — inflation approaching 2% — has remained elusive, among low-to-no wage growth in the domestic labor market. Weekly metrics tracking inflation have remained frustrating to economists, demonstrating inflation creep only in fits and starts. No sooner do narratives about real traction for inflation seem to appear than new data points wipe away much of what’s asserted with a regressive swing the other direction.That all said, the market continues to look for new all-time highs this week. Global growth, the cooling of tensions on the Pacific Rim and even Washington DC, better-than-expected outcomes from two major hurricanes and better-than-expected growth metrics in things like the Empire State Index have all contributed to the very bullish climate. The Fed has an opportunity to throw something of a wet blanket on this hot market, but perhaps doing so will assist in preventing the next crash, or at least keeping it from being too painful.Northrop Grumman Buys Orbital ATKDefense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) has announced it will acquire rocket propulsion and munitions manufacturing company Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion in cash. This amounts to roughly $134.50 plus debt, and has sent OA shares up nearly 20% on the news. Though the North Korea headlines seem to have ebbed lately, it would seem Northrop is looking to benefit from Orbital’s expertise in missile launch and weapons technology. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2018.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

2161,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) plans to start handling mortgage business in-house with its third-party provider PHH Corp , which is set to make an exit from the mortgage origination business next year.According to a Reuters article, sources familiar with the matter stated that Morgan Stanley feels this move will lead to improved customer-service and increased originations.The company would, however, be only managing the initial steps in mortgage lending. PHH Corp will continue to help Morgan Stanley with the later stages such as mortgage servicing.Also, Morgan Stanley would be making necessary recruitments for back-office operations as well as underwriting required for performing origination functions.The executives of Morgan Stanley are of the opinion that in-house handling of originations will result in a smoother process, lending an added advantage to approach wealthy clients with other products and services that the bank has to offer.Apart from Morgan Stanley, some other banks are adopting steps to build on their mortgage business. Recently, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) moved away from outsourcing mortgage originations to provide customers with better service. Also, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) had acquired mortgage servicing rights worth $51 billion from Seneca Mortgage Investment.Lately, Morgan Stanley has been taking steps to improve overall performance. It has been restructuring its operations with a view to reduce balance-sheet risks and strengthen the product portfolio. Also, it launched a cost-savings program, remaining on track to achieve $1 billion expense savings by 2017.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained 10.3% year to date versus the industry’s decline of nearly 1%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2162,MS,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q3 earnings releases. The going is good so far, with most big banks crushing estimates on both lines (read: Fed to Hike in December? Buy Quality ETFs).The backdrop should favor the banks along with the course of oil, the stance of the Fed and proposed policies of Trump. However, subdued inflation which may cause the Fed to act dovish and geopolitical risks are concerns for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at banking earnings in detail (read: Should You Buy Bank ETFs Before Earnings Release?):Big Bank Earnings in FocusJP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) reported earnings of $1.76 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 in the third quarter of 2017. Also, the figure reflected a 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million. Managed net revenues of $26.2 billion in the quarter were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.7 billion.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earned $1.04 per share in Q3, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share. The quarter’s total revenues were $21.9 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior-year quarter figure of $22.3 billion.Citigroup Inc.’s (C  -  Free Report) earnings per share of $1.42 for Q3 were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Revenues increased 2% year over year to $18.2 billion in the reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.7 billion.Bank of America Corporation’s (BAC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.48 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46. Also, the figure was 17% higher than the prior-year quarter number. Net revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up 1% from the prior-year quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22 billion.Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) earned $5.02 per share in Q3, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.31. Further, the bottom line witnessed 3% year-over-year improvement. Though the investment bank remains under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter, a continued momentum in investment banking business benefited the bottom-line numbers. Goldman’s net revenues climbed 2% year over year to $8.3 billion in the quarter under review. Furthermore, revenues handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion.Impressive performance of wealth management division and higher investment banking fees drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 93 cents per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The reported figure was 15% above the prior-year quarter. Net revenues amounted to $9.2 billion, a rise of 3% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9 billion.Market Impact Investors, who have still pinned their hopes on a moderate earnings season, Trump’s promises for deregulation and faster Fed policy tightening, must be keen on knowing how financial ETFs like iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG  -  Free Report), iShares US Financials ETF (IYF  -  Free Report), PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB  -  Free Report), Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report) responded to the earnings releases. These funds have considerable exposure to the aforementioned stocks (see all Financial ETFs here).ETF Performance Most of these ETFs slipped in the last five days (as of Oct 17, 2017) – in the peak of the earnings season. Goldman has moderate exposure in the afore-mentioned ETFs, rather it is heavy on iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI  -  Free Report), which also shed about 1.4% in the last five days (as of Oct 17, 2017) (read: Time to Buy Regional Bank ETFs?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2166,MS,"Investment banking powers Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) are set to report their third-quarter earnings tomorrow, in the face of somewhat uncertain times for the financial sector.Major banks help paint a picture of the overall health of the financial space, as they make up almost half of the finance sector’s total earnings. Commercial lending growth has been falling throughout the banking world, putting pressure on several key companies.In the latest round of bank earnings last week, firms like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) failed to significantly increase their lending volume, while also experiencing a decrease in the quality of their loan portfolios.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will look to buck this trend and fight back against an increase in passive investing, which has also hurt their businesses and returns.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are set to report their third-quarter earnings before markets open on Tuesday, Oct. 17.Both of these companies currently sport Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rankings, but the question still remains: which investment banking giant’s earnings report will be best? Let’s take a closer look to find out.Current EstimatesHeading into Goldman Sachs’ report, our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for earnings of $4.50 per share and revenues of $7.95 billion, which would mark year-over-year declines of 11.65% and 6.49%, respectively.Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, looks poised to experience modest quarterly gains. For one, the Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Morgan Stanley’s earnings to gain 1.25% to reach $0.80 per share. The company is also projected to hit $9.06 billion in revenue, which would represent year-over-year growth of 0.43%.Both companies face negative industry trends, and investors might not only care about revenue and earnings figures. But Goldman Sachs is projected to see substantial declines—and has received five downward earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days—while Morgan Stanley is expected to experience gains.Earnings WhispersLike always, investors will be interested to find out if Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley beat expectations. One way to gauge whether a company is poised to beat earnings estimates is by looking at the Zacks Earnings ESP.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.Goldman Sachs’ Earnings ESP currently rests at 0.28%, while Morgan Stanley’s Earnings ESP is 0.25%. Because the Earnings ESP’s surprise prediction capabilities are most effective with stocks ranked at Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, both companies current Zacks Ranks and positive ESP might give investors some confidence.Share Price TrendsAnother thing that investors might think about taking into account ahead of earnings is the recent movement of the companies’ stock.If a stock has moved up significantly before a report, earnings and revenue beats might not send shares much higher, because investors believe those beats are already built into the current price. On the opposite end of this spectrum, even a small beat for a company whose stock has been down or flat could send shares soaring.Shares of Goldman Sachs closed 1.60% higher on Monday and now rest only 5% below their 52-week high. The company’s stock price has climbed over 7% since the start of September.Morgan Stanley closed up over 1.30% and sits just 2.39% beneath its 52-week high of $50.14 per share. Shares of Morgan Stanley have surged around 6% higher over the last month and a half.This positive movement does not hold much predicative power, and it certainly does not determine what quarterly numbers the firms will actually post. But with strong upward movement in recent weeks from both stocks, any small beats might already be priced into their current stock prices, while a miss could send shares down big-time.Bottom LineAlthough Morgan Stanley’s earnings and revenue gains are expected to be relatively small, it seems like it will surely be the more attractive choice for investors hoping to see earnings and revenue growth. Goldman Sachs is projected to experience a double-digit earnings decline and over a 6% drop in sales, which could add significant pressure.With the rest of the categories as somewhat of a toss-up, it seems Morgan Stanley holds the edge over its counterpart.

2167,MS,"The earnings season is currently underway, with results coming out in full force this week. Tomorrow, three Investment Management/Brokerage stocks — Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR  -  Free Report) —  are scheduled to announce their results.Investment management/brokerage industry (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. Further, rising interest rates continue to benefit the industry. Also, most investment managers have stopped waiving off majority of their fees as interest rates gradually improved. So, this should aid top-line growth.However, muted volatility in third-quarter 2017 might lead to low capital markets business. Trading revenues are expected to decrease, mainly due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. Moreover, investment banking fees are anticipated to witness muted growth.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the investment management/brokerage industry in the quarter are expected to be down 3.7% year over year. This compares unfavorably with the prior-quarter growth of 8.6%.Now, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact above-mentioned three investment management/brokerage companies’ third-quarter results.Morgan Stanley is expected to record a decline in trading income — one of the major revenue components. Low market volatility and a seasonally weak period on the capital markets front are the main reasons for the decrease in trading revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for trading revenues is expected to be $2.86 billion for the quarter, down 9.8% from the prior-year period.On the other hand, total underwriting fees is projected to witness a 15.3% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $692 million. Also, advisory fees are projected to be $502 million, relatively stable year over year.Thus, total revenues are expected to improve marginally from the prior-year quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $9 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 81 cents reflects a 1.3% improvement on a year-over-year basis.The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). (Read more: Will Trading Slowdown Hurt Morgan Stanley Q3 Earnings?)Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteSimilar to Morgan Stanley, Goldman is anticipated to witness a fall in trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.39 billion reflects a year-over-year plunge of 29.3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $593 million indicates a decrease of 12.5% from the prior-year quarter.Nevertheless, persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) will likely provide some respite. Total underwriting fees are projected to be $894 million, improving nearly 2% year over year. Further, M&A advisory fees for the company are projected to lend support to revenues.But these will not be enough to support revenues for this Zacks Rank #3 stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $7.6 billion indicates a decline of 6.5% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $4.31 reflects an 11.7% fall on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Will Trading Weakness Impact Goldman's Q3 Earnings?)Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 37 cents reflects a 23.3% increase from the last- year quarter.The improvement is likely to be driven by a rise in top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for commission and execution fees of $154 million indicates 6.9% rise from the prior-year quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for interest income of $243 million reflects a jump of 54.8% year over year. Thus, total revenues are expected to grow 8.7% from the prior-year quarter with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales being $375 million.Additionally, at the end of the quarter, Interactive Brokers is projected to have 446,000 brokerage accounts, up 20.5% year over year.

2168,MS,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 17, are expected to show a decline in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the negative impact on earnings.    Similar to the prior quarter, slump in fixed-income trading revenues is expected to be the main reason for the decline in trading revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.18 billion reflect a decline of 5.1% sequentially and 20.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.88 billion indicates a decrease of 12.7% from the prior quarter. However, equity trading revenues are expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis.The decline in trading revenues is largely attributable to higher-than-usual volatility (due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U.S. presidential election) in the year-ago quarter. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Absence of any concrete development on the proposed financial reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the primary reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter.Overall, Q3 trading revenue is expected to be $2.86 billion, down 10.3% from the last quarter and 9.8% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s Q3 results:Underwriting fees to rise: Though equity underwriting volumes in the third quarter were low owing to seasonality, this is not likely to have any significant impact on Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting market share, given its strong global presence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $297 million reflects a jump of 25.8% from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this has been leading to strong gains for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $395 million reflects year-over-year growth of 8.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees is projected to witness a 15.3% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $692 million.Stable advisory fees: With the overall improvement in global M&A scenario during the third quarter, Morgan Stanley should be able to generate decent advisory fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $502 million, relatively stable year over year.Net interest income (NII) to increase marginally: Improvement in demand for loans — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 81 cents reflects a 1.3% improvement on a year-over-year basis.

2169,MS,"Meal-kit startup HelloFresh recently announced plans to go public, despite the post-IPO woes of rival Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report). The company announced on Tuesday its plans to raise as much as $352 million in an initial public offering in Frankfurt, Germany.HelloFresh is set to list on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the help of Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), and others.“The public listing marks the next logical step to further expand our business, to secure our position as the leading global player and to pursue our long-term growth strategy,” HelloFresh co-founder and CEO Dominik Richter said in a company release.HelloFresh clearly plans to buck the trend that saw investors dump Blue Apron’s stock, which has been cut in half since going public this summer.Now let’s take a look at HelloFresh so potential investors can gain a better understanding of the recipe-kit delivery company as it nears its first days of trading.Young & Simple Founded in 2011, HelloFresh delivers between two and four meals a week, for two to four people, as part of three different plans: classic, veggie, and family. The company delivers the ingredients and recipes for free seven-days a week.HelloFresh gives users the chance to either be surprised, or select their meals every week from a range of options. The company works with chefs and dietitians to create 15 new meals every week.Family plans cost $8.74 per serving, while the classic and vegetarian options—for two people—run $9.99 per serving. In the U.S., HelloFresh delivers seven days a week in specific areas, and on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday everywhere else.International OperationsHelloFresh sells its meal-kit services in 10 countries. Its more than 2,000 employees help operate the business across Europe, including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, the U.K., Germany, and others.On top of that, HelloFresh is currently in Australia and operates throughout the continental U.S. This might help give the company a leg-up against its American rival Blue Apron, which only offers its services in the U.S.ScaleThe company’s CEO says that his meal-kit company is currently outperforming its competitors, citing faster growth and market-share gains as primary justifications for the claim. HelloFresh reported 53% year-over-year sales growth in September. HelloFresh claimed that it added 90,000 accounts during the second quarter and now boasts about 1.3 million customers worldwide. The company said it delivered 33.7 million total meals last quarter.Current OutlookDespite its German roots, HelloFresh's biggest market is the U.S. However, in order to gain market share, the company has been spending heavily to offer trials and discount offers, as well as pumping promotions on radio and TV.With heavy spending and rapid expansion, HelloFresh is still unprofitable and reported a $66.9 million loss in the first half of 2017.The push to expand has helped the company grow overall. The company’s revenues doubled in 2016, and it is projected to grow by as much as 50% this year. HelloFresh also hopes to reach its break-even point within 15 months.Experienced OwnerGerman venture capital and technology incubator Rocket Internet SE owns a 53% stake in HelloFresh. Shares of Rocket gained slightly after the IPO announcement.As of last year, Rocket, which is one of Europe’s most high-profile incubators, had helped launch roughly 100 businesses in 110 countries in the last decade, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Rocket has already helped another food delivery company go public recently. The company owns a portion of Berlin-based Delivery Hero, which has seen its stock price climb despite the crowded space.Aside from its potentially helpful guidance, Rocket’s majority stake in the company means that new HelloFresh investors will have less access to shares, as only 20% of the company is up for grabs, according to a recent report.Bottom Line The company considered an IPO in 2015 when it was valued at over $3 billion. HelloFresh’s valuation fell to about $2.36 billion last year, which is still greater than Blue Apron’s current $969 million market cap.HelloFresh plans to continue to expand its business and add to its offerings by adding more choices and personalization options—including wine and desserts.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

2170,MS,"In yet another step toward its initiatives to simplify operations and become a regional commercial banking institution, CIT Group Inc. (CIT  -  Free Report) inked a deal to sell Financial Freedom and the reverse mortgage portfolio to an undisclosed buyer. The transaction will enable the company to exit reverse mortgage operations.Financial Freedom became part of CIT Group when the latter acquired OneWest Bank in August 2015. The unit has been part of the company’s discontinued operation since then.Transaction DetailsThe deal comprisessale of mortgage servicing rights and nearly $900 million worth of reverse mortgage whole loans (including other real estate loans) as of Jun 30, 2017. The financial terms of the transaction were not revealed.CIT Group expected the deal, still subject to regulatory and investors approval, to close by mid-2018.Road Ahead for CIT GroupThe Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT Group, Ellen R. Alemany said, “Throughout this year we have made continued progress in transforming the company and applying our focus toward maximizing the potential of our commercial banking and deposit franchises, which are the core of our go-forward strategy.”CIT Group has come a long way since its emergence from bankruptcy in 2009. The company has been streamlining its operations with a goal to simplify operations and improve efficiency.In June, CIT Group announced a deal to sell its European Rail business, while in April the company sold stakes in the joint ventures with Tokyo Century Corporation and divested its aircraft leasing business. Over the last few years, the company has divested its Canadian, Brazilian and Mexican businesses, among others.Driven by such efforts, analysts seem to be bullish on the stock. The company’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings estimates have been revised 6.4% upward over the last 60 days.Nonetheless, investors look sceptical about CIT Group’s prospects. Shares of the company have gained 34.3% in a year’s time, outperforming 27.9% rally for the industry.Currently, CIT Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2171,MS,"In this era of digitization where digital money is becoming popular, Wall Street giant — The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) — is planning to initiate a cryptocurrency trading operation involving bitcoin and other digital currencies. However, the digital currency trading business initiative is still in nascent stages, which if materializes, will need the bank’s strategic investments and involvement of currency-trading segments.""In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in this space,"" a Goldman spokeswoman said in a statement.However, some banks are against the concept of bitcoin. Last month, speaking against bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) CEO Jamie Dimon called the digital currency a ""fraud"" that ""won't end well."" Further, last week, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) CEO James Gorman noted that digital currencies like bitcoin are ""more than just a fad.""Similar MovesRecently, world’s six largest banks including Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) joined forces to make a new form of digital currency, the launch of which is scheduled next year. Financial transactions are going to be settled over blockchain, the technology that bitcoin uses.Blockchain is a technology that allows users to distribute digital information without being copied. It is one of the most innovative technologies which help reduce risk and improve capital efficiency in financial markets. Though this was originally developed for bitcoin, the financial industry is coming up with other ways to explore its potential.The main intention behind rolling this out is to enable financial groups to exchange money without waiting for physical money transfers, which takes a lot more time. Digital coins could be exchanged for cash at central banks and thus help in cutting costs for the banks.ConclusionBitcoin has always been controversial and involved skepticism drawing regulators’ concerns related to security risks and scams. Notably, initial coin offerings have been banned in China and cryptocurrency exchanges have stopped trading.Though Bitcoin's price has been volatile on market sentiments and on the crackdown in China, the same is expected to settle, as the digital currency gains market share. Notably, the total value of digital currencies came in around $150 billion compared with $17.5 billion at the beginning of 2017, which represents bitcoin’s value about half of all cryptocurrencies.Therefore, if Goldman becomes successful in its initiative, weakness in bond trading affecting overall revenues might be counterbalanced to an extent.Goldman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2172,MS,"Investors in Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 6, 2017 $39.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options todayWhat is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Morgan Stanley shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Morgan Stanley is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Investment Bank industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased its earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 84 cents per share to 82 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Morgan Stanley right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2173,MS,"Per a Business Insider report, Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) messaging application, Snapchat is being used for recruiting “next generation bankers” from 19 U.S. universities by leading global financial services firm Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). The investment bank was also the lead underwriter of Snapchat’s parent company when it went public on Mar 2, 2017.Moreover, a geofilter has also been themed on Morgan Stanley that will enable students of these universities to take a picture with it.Notably, shares of Snap have lost 38.6% of its value since its listing date of Mar 2, 2017 against 8.5% growth of its industry.Focus on Boosting Subscriber BaseSnap has been experiencing a slowdown in its user base and revenue growth rates. A decline in user growth may look unattractive to advertisers, the primary source of revenues for Snap, and thereby dampen its growth opportunities.Interestingly, analysts have related the slowdown in Snapchat’s user growth to the popularity of Instagram Stories, a blatant rip-off of the former’s hallmark feature.Snap Inc. Price Snap Inc. Price | Snap Inc. QuoteHowever, per eMarketer’s latest report, this year, Snapchat’s domestic user base is likely to increase 25.8% to 79.2 million driven by a 19.2% increase in users in the 18 to 24 age group. In fact, for the first time, Snapchat is projected to have the highest teen audience (12 to 17 & 18 to 24 cohorts) compared to both Facebook and Instagram, per eMarketer.We believe a big name like Morgan Stanley choosing the platform for recruitment purpose bodes well for the company. Snapchat will be able to lure the students of University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Villanova, Howard, and all the other 14 colleges where this recruitment strategy is operational.Social media is being used by most of the companies for recruitment purposes. Per HireRight’s 2017 Benchmark Report, social networking is the fastest growing source of finding and recruiting new hires. Usage of social media platforms like Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) LinkedIn and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) for recruitment purposes increased 10% over the last year. Additionally, per HireRight’s 2017 Transportation Employment Screening Benchmark Report, social media’s utilization increased 13% while the use of print media and online job boards declined 6% and 10% compared with the data of the previous year.This trend bodes well for platforms like Snapchat as it will help it increase its user base. Further, advertisers will also be attracted to the platform if more names like Morgan Stanley choose the platform for such purposes.Zacks RankSnap has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2174,MS,"Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.  is mulling over shifting its investment banking base from London to Amsterdam, inside the European Union (EU), post Brexit. It is also considering opening an investment banking branch in Paris.Post Brexit, Britain is likely to lose the “passporting rights,” which compels international banks to open branches and conduct business easily in any part of the European territory after the initial process of registration is over. Hence, MUFG’s securities division has decided to submit an application for a license to set up a subsidiary in Amsterdam ensuring that they can carry on providing services to its existing EU clients.Investment banking head office in London will continue to be the headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, per sources familiar with the matter. The bank has close to 2,000 employees in its London office out of which a few people will be relocated to either the Amsterdam or Paris branch.Despite elevated expenses, negative interest rates in Japan, uncertain global economy and a stringent regulatory landscape, this Japanese investment banking firm has been consistently growing through acquisitions on the back of its strong liquidity position. Further, it remains focused on its medium-term business plan (2016-2018), which includes upgradation and reformation of its business model and exploration of new business areas.  All the major banks are looking at options to shift their base inside the EU since the announcement of Brexit. Banks like Standard Chartered (SCBFF  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Nomura Holdings (NMR  -  Free Report) have chosen Frankfurt as the next financial hub inside the EU.Shares of MUFG have gained 26.6% over the last 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 27.3%.Currently, the bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2175,MS,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) is on track to develop and build a successful smart-beta investing strategy, which is more complex but cheaper than the conventional indexes that are weighed according to market capitalization, per a Bloomberg report. As part of this effort, the asset management division of the company has lowered the fees for its smart-beta funds.The company is offering a new fund to its clients, where investors need to pay only 0.09% to gain exposure to a portfolio of equal-weighted large-cap stocks.With this, the company’s funds will become cheaper than any other comparable fund that is weighed equally.It goes without saying that asset managers have finally realised that investors get more attracted toward low-cost products. Hence, they need to develop alternate strategies, which can assure better business from their clients.Smart-beta investing strategies offer better risk and return trade-off to clients by using objective factors such as volatility or dividends and not market cap to weigh indexes.Given that investors are getting obsessed with cost, Goldman Sachs now dreams of being at the forefront of smart-beta investing by coming up with products that are cheaper than any other asset managers’ products.However, this is not the first time that the company has taken such a drastic step. Two years ago, the company developed its first fund, which also charges 0.09%, and is skewed toward large-cap stocks with value, momentum, low volatility and quality.The company’s shares have gained 32.4% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 28.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, Goldman Sachs carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) and LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

2176,MS,"Speculations of massive destruction by Hurricane Irma had rattled the insurance industry. The storm's impact on Florida, however, was not as devastating as expected as it has been downgraded to Category 1. Storm surges were also of a lesser magnitude than the National Hurricane Center’s initial projections.As Irma inflicted lesser damage than feared, insurance stocks bounced back and were among the biggest gainers on the bourses. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), in the meanwhile, said that the insurance industry “has strong balance sheet to weather the financial impact” of the storm and has historically performed well after such nerve-wrecking events.Needless to say, the insurance industry is already boosting business operations, implementing new technologies and investing in cybersecurity to drive growth. Thus, investing in sound insurance stocks seems prudent at the moment.Insurance Stocks: The Biggest GainersInsurance stocks had been losing ground for weeks as the hurricanes dampened investors’ sentiments. Rating agency Moody’s cautioned that property and casualty insurers, reinsurers as well as alternative capital providers like the buyers of catastrophe bonds, were all likely to undergo “substantial losses” owing to the hurricanes, particularly Irma. And why not? Irma was expected to be the most powerful hurricane and had already wrecked roads and telecommunications systems in the French Caribbean island territories.The lesser damage has been a blessing in disguise for insurance stocks.

Residents of Florida had fled to safety as the hurricane was anticipated to hit with record-breaking winds of 185 miles an hour. The 400-mile-wide hurricane was devastating enough to affect the entire state (read more: Hurricane Irma Set to Hit Florida: Gainers & Losers).Irma, however, gradually lost strength once it made landfall on the Florida Keys on Sep 10. The eye of the storm missed Miami and lost steam once it crossed the mostly uninhabited Everglades. Following this, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm. Chief investment officer of Atlantic Trust, David Donabedian said that “it was a relief rally”, while AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling software firm added that expected losses stemming from Irma is between $20 billion and $40 billion, way below their initial forecast of $20-$65 billion.New Technologies & Business Models Bode Well for InsurersMajority of U.S. insurance company CEOs that participated in the KPMG U.S. CEO Outlook 2017 are confident about the prospects of their firms in the next three years.

2177,MS,"From the “sell in May and go away” to the Santa Clause rally, there are numerous calendar-driven investing strategies. Lately, talks that September is the worst month for stocks have been making the rounds, and rightly so.Devastating storms continue to affect the energy, restaurant, travel and insurance industries in the United States. While hurricane Irma has begun its destructive barrage on Florida, the estimated impact of hurricane Harvey on the economy surpasses the combined effect of hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. As if that wasn’t enough, North Korea continues to add to geopolitical tensions at a time when U.S. stock valuations are stretched and global growth soft.Meanwhile, investors should practice caution and pick stocks of companies with big brands. Such companies have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investors, even when the equity market gets rocky.Irma Batters Florida, Harvey Drains CoffersIrma made landfall on Florida’s southern islands. The hurricane has claimed three lives and has resulted in power loss for more than 1 million customers. Residents of Miami and Tampa moved to safer zones, leaving behind ghost towns. Per National Weather Service, Irma gained strength as category 4 storms after being downgraded to category 3 as it moved to Florida. Governor Rick Scott has warned that Irma is stronger than hurricane Andrew that had wrecked the state in 1992 (read more: Hurricane Irma Set to Hit Florida: Gainers & Losers).AccuWeather raised the estimated damage caused by Hurricane Harvey to $190 billion, or a full 1% of U.S. GDP. This highlights an increase from an earlier tally of $160 billion. The most affected area is likely to be Houston, the fourth biggest city in the United States. The city is expected to remain uninhabitable for weeks or even months, thanks to mold and dirty water.  Harvey has crippled a dozen refineries including the biggest in the country, Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s Motiva facility in Port Arthur and Exxon Mobil Corp’s (XOM  -  Free Report) Baytown facility. Both of the facilities account for more than 30% of U.S. refining capacity, per HIS Markit. Meanwhile, restaurant companies with business concentration in Texas and surrounding areas have been affected the most. Sonic Corporation (SONC  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) have almost one-third of their store base in Texas. And for airlines, United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL  -  Free Report) will eventually have to bear the brunt since 19% of its capacity is in Houston. Major insurance companies are also factoring in the catastrophic effect of the hurricanes on their business (read more: 4 Home-Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey Mayhem).North Korea Threatens ‘Greatest Pain’ for Sanctions North Korea, in the meanwhile, threatened to inflict ‘pain and suffering’ on the United States if it issues sanctions in response to Kim Jong-un regime’s sixth nuclear test last week. Notably, the bomb is an advanced hydrogen one that can be placed on an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said that if the United States “does rig up the illegal and unlawful resolution,” it would respond in kind.The White House reacted strongly and warned North Korea that military actions are still on the table if Pyongyang threatens the United States or its allies. The White House wants the United Nations to impose a halt to oil exports to North Korea and at the same time freeze Kim Jong-un’s assets. The United States is also demanding a ban on North Koreans working abroad since they pass most of the foreign currency to the regime.U.S. Stocks Overvalued, China Raises Global Growth WorriesA record number of fund managers see the U.S. market as the most overvalued in the world. Among the 20 valuation metrics tracked by Ned Davis Research, 16 indicate that the U.S. stocks are extremely overvalued.The stocks’ current cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio has only been exceeded in 1929 and 2000 – both prior to major corrections. In 1929, Wall Street was subjected to an infamous crash, while 2000 saw the dotcom implosion. This time around, expansion in profit margins led to lofty valuations, which raise concerns of a possible downturn (read more: 5 Great Value Picks for the World's Priciest Market).Overnight trade data from China was rather mixed, raising questions about global growth. China’s exports did increase from a year earlier in August, but, the recent rise in yuan’s value is starting to weigh on such exports. The yuan rose 2% against the U.S. dollar in August, its highest monthly gain since July 2005. The currency rebounded from a 6.6% decline last year to its highest level in more than 20 months this week. Chen Lin, general manager at Hefei DGCT Imp. & Exp. Co. Ltd, added that rising yuan is eating into profits from his pet toys business. Imports are also expected to take a beating because the government’s efforts to reduce debt are having an adverse impact on domestic demand.4 Solid Big-Brand Stocks for NowWith so many concerns plaguing investors, big-brand stocks offer some respite at the moment.

2178,MS,"Armed with cost-reduction initiatives and balance-sheet strengthening, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) appears a promising pick right now. Moreover, it is well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment.A positive trend in estimate revisions reflect optimism over the company’s earnings growth prospects.

Though the company witnessed rising expenses for the last several years, a number of recent strategies and the above-mentioned plan have reversed the trend. Expenses declined in 2015 and 2016.

2181,MS,"These are tough times for U.S. markets for sure. Investors are smarting from two straight weeks of losses and the Trump administration’s recent actions have only added to their worries. From frequent departures at Trump’s core team to heightened tensions with North Korea, surely markets have had much to worry about.But do political events actually have a major impact on the bourses over a longer period? Jim Cramer certainly doesn’t think so. In a recent edition of his iconic Mad Money show, he explained that upheavals in Washington hardly mattered to markets.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) seem to be in agreement and believes that conditions for a Bull Run remain in place. This is why it makes for a smart move to buy value stocks on the dip and lie in wait of the next wave.Two Straight Weeks of LossesBy Aug 18, markets had endured two straight weeks of losses. The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had lost 1.4%, 2% and 2.3%, respectively, over this period. In fact, the Nasdaq has now posted four straight weeks of losses, losing in excess of 3%. The first week of losses was largely attributable to a further deterioration in U.S.-North Korea relations.Then, on Aug 17, the S&P 500 declined more than 1%, suffering its worst daily loss in more than three months. It was only the third occasion this year that it had gained or lost in excess of 1%. Market watchers believe the session’s losses were largely attributable to speculation over Gary Cohn’s resignation from the position of chief economic advisor to President Trump.Factors Propelling Bully Run Still in PlaceStocks ultimately inched upward on Aug 21, but the Nasdaq continued to trend lower. However, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity Strategist Michael Wilson classifies the Aug 17 selloff as only a “re-test” of the correction which occurred during the preceding week. A “re-test” is market parlance for a second drop which follows an initial drop and recovery. Only, on this occasion, prices are only trying to “re-test” the fresh low.Wilson contends that a successful “re-test” happens only when optimism about price increases exists, a signal which he thinks has been noticed. Morgan Stanley also believes that the factors that power stocks remain firmly in place. These include a resilient economy and earnings growth, easy interest rates and steadily increasing inflation. A responsive Federal Reserve and fair valuations are other positives, according to Wilson.  Cramer, Wilson Ignore Political EventsWhat is worth noting is that Wilson’s set of factors propelling stock gains does not include government policies or legislative action. Politics seem to be only a distraction for investors and investment themes geared to White House policy have been largely set aside. Using this logic, the impact of events such as those which occurred on Aug 17 is limited to the short term.Jim Cramer had expressed similar sentiments while discussing the fallout of Trump’s response to the Charlottesville incident and his decision to disband manufacturing councils. Or lack thereof, as was apparent when all major benchmarks traded higher even after these events. Cramer had also discounted the impact of political events. Instead, he too, ascribed markets’ strength to strong earnings performances, soft interest rates and steady inflation growth.Our ChoicesIgnoring the downturn of recent weeks, Morgan Stanley believes that factors powering stock market gains remain in place. This means that recent losses are only a temporary lull and the market rally could resume soon. This is why the financial major is urging investors to buy on the dip.Buying value stocks on this dip looks like a smart option. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank.We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new style score system.Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space.

2182,MS,"Over the last five trading days, investors’ pessimistic stance continued for the banking stocks. Release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting indicated a divide over the timing of interest rate hikes. The primary reason for this is the expectation of inflation staying below the Fed’s targeted level of 2% for an extended period.While banks, at present, are reaping benefits from higher rates (easing margin pressure and increase in interest income), it now seems uncertain when the next rate hike will occur. This is perhaps one of the reasons that affected investors’ confidence in the banking stocks to some extent.Also, disbanding of President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council and the Strategy & Policy Forum indicate continued disruptions happening in the White House. Though this development is not likely to directly affect several proposed policy initiatives that are expected to strengthen the economy, investors now seem to be concerned over the timing.Apart from these macro factors, banks continue to reel from litigation and regulatory probes. Legal headwinds pertaining to business malpractices in the pre-crisis period persist.On the other hand, banks are intending to boost profitability through streamlining strategies. Also, with an aim to focus more on diversifying revenue base, banks are increasing market share in lucrative sectors.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Aug 11, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. Per a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) merchant services division has been accused of charging small business with unacceptable fees for credit card transactions. Also, the bank has been alleged to have charged excessively high fees for early termination. (Read more: Wells Fargo Accused of Levying High Early Termination Fees)2. A lawsuit has been filed in the federal court in Manhattan by three public pension funds against six major banks. In the suit filed by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, Orange County Employees' Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association, the banks have been accused of collaborating and conspiring to remove competition from the stock lending market.The accused banks are Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG.In the stock lending market, investors can sell a stock without owning it through a process called short selling. Investors or firms borrow stock with the help of agents by paying a fee and then sell it expecting to buy it again in the future at a lower price.Some upstart lending platforms were developed to help various borrowers and lenders interact directly without the use of middlemen.However, the above mentioned banks have been accused of trying to boycott and hence block the development of such lending platforms over the years. This was done to remove competition from the lending market and thereby charge higher fee from borrowers who wanted to engage in short selling. The act is in violation of the federal antitrust law.Moreover, in order to prevent borrowers from going to other places in the market to get better prices, the banks had created a lending platform of their own called EquiLend LLC. It is through this platform that the banks have been trying to develop anticompetitive strategies in the market to safeguard their interests.3. Capital One Financial Corp.

2184,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) has been charged $13 million in fines for inadequately supervising short-term trades of certain unit investment trusts (UIT). On Monday, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered the brokerage firm to pay $3.25 million in fines and $9.78 million in restitution to its clients.According to FINRA, the charges pertain to the period between January 2012 and June 2015, when hundreds of brokers at Morgan Stanley recommended clients to sell UIT’s before the maturity date and roll them over into a new product. During this period, a few brokers sold their clients’ UITs less than 100 days before the maturity to invest the money into new products.According to the regulatory body’s head of enforcement, Susan Schroeder, trading of UITs on a short-term basis raises concerns about its suitability because of the way the products have been designed.Unit investment trusts are structured as long-term holdings and are to be held for at least 15-24 months after which they close. The return from the investment depends on how the product performed during that period.However, if a customer keeps selling his investments frequently before the maturity date and reinvests the money into new trusts, he will have to pay a higher sum as sales charges. And, over time, this reduces the suitability of the investment for the client.Notably, the supervisory team at Morgan Stanley was not properly trained to recognize and stop such short-term trading of UITs.Although Morgan Stanley interviewed almost 65 of its employees as part of the investigation and consented to the regulator’s findings, it did not make any comments about the charges levied upon it. It has neither accepted nor denied the fines.A few investment brokers worth considering are mentioned below.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.’s (IBKR  -  Free Report) shares have gained more than 20% in a year’s time.

2185,MS,"This week brings us the latest Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) two-day meeting, where Fed presidents from regions across the U.S. meet with Fed Chair Janet Yellen to discuss and decide on monetary policy. The participants convene tomorrow, and by Wednesday afternoon we look forward to a press conference with Yellen regarding any changes being made.Literally no one expects another rate hike this time around, but most analysts are looking toward a table set for unwinding the Fed’s $4.5 trillion on its balance sheet. Formerly, some had expected interest rates to rise further before the unwinding program was to begin; language used by the Fed in its recent meetings, however, give a clearer indication of how important the Fed members find this unwinding to be.There is an entire cottage industry dedicated to parsing phrases and changes to previous statements the Fed makes, and this week there is new material many will be interested in seeing whether the Fed will draw from. In short, these new findings are calling the current market among the most expensive — if not the most expensive — in history. A prominent strategist at Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) points out that an equal-weighted bond/equity portfolio has never been pricier. Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) Ruchir Sharma points out this is the first time we see all assets — from housing to stocks to bonds — at their highest levels of expense simultaneously.According to other reports, the market is valued at four times the real economy. We appear to be at stretching points seen in both 2000 and 2007 — the years directly preceding the two most recent major market crashes. And if it stands to reason that bubbles risks increase the longer low interest rates exist, then we may at very least see more of the Fed’s conversation take up this subject. Will the Fed begin to focus more on financial stability than merely its dual mandate of low unemployment and manageable inflation?One half of that dual mandate has been met for awhile now, but the other — inflation approaching 2% — has remained elusive, among low-to-no wage growth in the domestic labor market. Weekly metrics tracking inflation have remained frustrating to economists, demonstrating inflation creep only in fits and starts. No sooner do narratives about real traction for inflation seem to appear than new data points wipe away much of what’s asserted with a regressive swing the other direction.That all said, the market continues to look for new all-time highs this week. Global growth, the cooling of tensions on the Pacific Rim and even Washington DC, better-than-expected outcomes from two major hurricanes and better-than-expected growth metrics in things like the Empire State Index have all contributed to the very bullish climate. The Fed has an opportunity to throw something of a wet blanket on this hot market, but perhaps doing so will assist in preventing the next crash, or at least keeping it from being too painful.Northrop Grumman Buys Orbital ATKDefense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) has announced it will acquire rocket propulsion and munitions manufacturing company Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion in cash. This amounts to roughly $134.50 plus debt, and has sent OA shares up nearly 20% on the news. Though the North Korea headlines seem to have ebbed lately, it would seem Northrop is looking to benefit from Orbital’s expertise in missile launch and weapons technology. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2018.

2186,MS,"Shares of rental car giant Hertz (HTZ  -  Free Report) crashed on Thursday after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) downgraded the company’s stock.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas demoted Hertz from “equal weight” to “underweight.” The firm lowered its Hertz price target to $14 a share, which is almost $10 below Wednesday’s closing price.Hertz stock price had skyrocketed from under $9 a share in June to rest at $23.93 per share on Wednesday. This massive uptick in stock price is part of the reason for Morgan Stanley’s downgrade. The analysts wrote that Hertz shares experienced a “dramatic re-rating over the past 3 months.”“The core of [their] downgrade is valuation,” Jonas wrote. “Destructive weather events present a material short-term increase to pricing but we believe this is more than in the share price… Structural issues with the car rental model remain.”The car rental company’s stock had climbed well before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused destruction in Texas and Florida, but the tropical storms did help send shares of Hertz up even higher.Now, analysts at Morgan Stanley are pumping the breaks on the stock, citing previously powerful sell-off incentives, such as low used car prices and competition from ride-sharing services like Uber.Shares of Hertz tanked over 10.34% on Thursday morning after the downgrade. Morgan Stanley’s new “underweight” evaluation for the Estero, Florida-based car rental agency helped send shares of fellow car rental conglomerate, Avis Budget Group (CAR  -  Free Report), lower as well.Shares of Avis sunk by more than 5.55%, after experiencing a similarly massive climb since the start of summer.In the past 60 days, Hertzhas received three downward earnings estimate revisions for this quarter, next quarter, the current full-year, and its next fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for a 17.88% EPS dip this quarter and a massive 401.37% drop off for the full year.Our consensus estimate currently calls for $2.54 billion worth of sales this quarter, which would mark a 0.72% year-over-year decline. We also project full-year revenues to fall by 1.53%. Hertzis currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Avis’ projected EPS growth for the current quarter sits at 21.59%, but full year estimates call for a 10.24% decline. Despite positive revenue projections for this quarter and next quarter, we’ve seen two negative revisions to Avis’ full-year earnings estimates within the past 60 days, as well as two downgrades for the next year. Avis is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).New Report: An Investor’s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever.

2187,MS,"Several massive investment banks saw their stock prices fall in the first day of trading after the Labor Day weekend on the back of continuing tensions surrounding North Korea.North Korea Less than a week after North Korea launched a missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, Kim Jong Un’s regime conducted its sixth nuclear test over the weekend. The latest test—this time of a hydrogen bomb—was highly important and could spark even more international retaliation and sanctions.North Korea said in a televised statement that it considers its weekend test to be a “perfect success in the test of a hydrogen bomb for an ICBM” and that “the creditability of the operation of the nuclear warhead is fully guaranteed.”President Donald Trump addressed the latest Pyongyang test in a series of responses via Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).SundayNorth Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test.

2188,MS,"UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) is mulling over shifting its trading headquarters from London to Frankfurt inside the European Union (EU), post Brexit, as per a Bloomberg report.UBS plans to relocate around 250 employees from London to Frankfurt. Though nothing has been finalized yet, talks are on. According to people familiar with the matter, the bank, which currently employs 4800 people worldwide, informed the German regulator about the rise in business in Frankfurt. However, UBS is yet to confirm the same.Post Brexit, Britain is likely to lose the “passporting rights,” which enable international banks to open branches and conduct business easily in any part of the European territory after the initial process of registration is over. Hence, UBS plans to pick Frankfurt as its new hub. However, other prospective locations like Amsterdam and Madrid are also being considered. The final decision will likely be taken by the end of summer.Frankfurt has been a popular choice among banks since the announcement of Brexit. All major banks like Standard Chartered PLC (SCBFF  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Nomura Holdings, Inc. (NMR  -  Free Report) have chosen the city as the next financial hub inside the EU.  UBS has been putting in diligent efforts to reduce its cost by CHF 2.1 billion, by the end of 2017. Notably, during the first six months of 2017, the company was successful in slashing expenses. Gradual cost reduction will boost its bottom-line growth.Shares of UBS have gained 3.1% over the last six months compared to the industry’s growth of 4.6%.Currently, the bank carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2189,MS,"A lawsuit has been filed in the federal court in Manhattan by three public pension funds against six major banks. In the suit filed by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, Orange County Employees' Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association, the banks have been accused of collaborating and conspiring to remove competition from the stock lending market.The accused banks are Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report).In the stock lending market, investors can sell a stock without owning it through a process called “short selling"". Investors or firms borrow a stock with the help of agents by paying a fee and then sell it first with the expectation of buying it later at a lower price.Some upstart lending platforms were developed to help various borrowers and lenders interact directly without the use of middlemen.However, the above mentioned banks have been accused of trying to boycott and hence block the development of such lending platforms over the years. This was done to remove competition from the lending market and thereby charge higher fee from borrowers who wanted to engage in short selling. The act is in violation of the federal antitrust law.Moreover, in order to prevent borrowers from going to other places in the market to get better prices, the banks had created a lending platform of their own called EquiLend LLC. It is through this platform that the banks have been trying to develop anticompetitive strategies in the market to safeguard their interests.EquiLend is also a defendant in the case. However, none of the defendants made any comments.Of the six banks mentioned, UBS Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2190,MS,"Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained more than 1% for the first time in 3 months on Aug 14, while the Dow Jones rose more than 100 points as geopolitical fears ebb. In fact, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq traded above their 50-day moving averages as Wall Street sees less tension over North Korea.The broad stock market rally followed a loss of nearly $1 trillion dollar last week, when President Trump warned Kim Jong-un’s hermit state that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatens the United States, leading to a verbal standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.Corporate America, meanwhile, is having its best earnings season in 13 years with top executives from Dow Chemical Co  and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) citing rise in overseas sales, a telltale sign that should help boost gains in the second half of this year. Economists also predict that U.S. economic expansion will last another two years, while global growth chugs along. Thanks to such bullish trends, it will be prudent to invest in some of the top gainers.U.S. – North Korea Standoff CalmsGeopolitical fears seem to have faded after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis said that Washington would continue to pursue diplomatic solutions with North Korea. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster also stated that there was no hint of a war with Pyongyang. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged for a peaceful resolution to the North Korea issue.The soothing comments came after Trump said last week that Pyongyang will face “fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.” His harsh words came in after U.S. intelligence analysts said that North Korea has developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Following Trump’s comments, North Korea said that it was “examining the operational plan” to strike sensitive areas like the Anderson Air Force base.Best Earnings Season for Corporate America in 13 YearsCorporate profits, in the meantime, are on pace to register the highest number of S&P 500 companies beating sales estimates in 13 years, as per Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) equity strategists. They added the earnings beats will also be the highest since 2004.Of the 454 companies in the S&P 500 that have so far reported second-quarter results, earnings for these companies are up 10.8% from the same period last year on 5.8% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68% beating revenue estimates.While Europe has been the source of strength in the first three months of this year, emerging-market sales were the driving force from April through June. A weak dollar benefitted U.S. companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), which beat earnings estimates.U.S. Economic Growth Will Last Another 2 Years U.S. economic growth also will last at least another two years, according to 34 of 57 economists polled by Reuters. Among those economists, 13 said it would last more than three years, while 21 said two to three years.U.S. GDP has already crossed the $19 trillion mark, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Under Trump, the U.S. economy grew more than $300 billion in just two quarters. Conversely, at the end of the first two quarters under President Obama, U.S. GDP had contracted.A rebound in consumer spending boosted overall economic growth. Consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter as Americans spent more on healthcare, groceries and clothes. Spending rebounded in the last quarter, buoyed by an uptick in household finances. Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back-to-back quarters this year since the first half of 2015.Signs of Global Growth Boosted StocksStocks were also helped by signs that global growth is persisting along. Japan’ economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4% in the second quarter, its fastest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2015. Private consumption and capital expenditures were cited to be the reasons behind this uptick in economic expansion. This also marked the country’s longest streak of uninterrupted growth in 11 years.While growth was faster than expected in Japan, China’s factory output rose 6.4% in July from a year earlier. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already revised up growth expectations for China for this year and next. Overall, IMF has kept its growth forecasts for the world economy unchanged for this year and next.                       Top 5 GainersBanking on such positive trends, we have selected five solid stocks from the major indices.

2191,MS,"Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) stock surged 2.08% on Monday morning after the electric car company received two separate analyst upgrades.Morgan Stanley's (MS  -  Free Report) Adam Jonas raised his Tesla price target to $317 a share from $305 a share. That number might surprise some investors as shares of Tesla currently sit at over $365. However, the analyst also upped his “bull case” target for the car company to $526 a share from $511 a share.Jonas noted that his Tesla upgrade is based only on the company’s main electric car business. The analyst did not change his outlook on Tesla Mobility, Tesla Energy, or Solar City.""Although other auto companies have launched and will continue to launch electric vehicles, we are not aware of any other auto company that is building out the necessary after-sales infrastructure to support a significant volume of electric vehicles in the car parc,"" Jonas wrote in a note. ""EV infrastructure will be crucial to enable an ownership and operating experience commensurate with the product.""The Morgan Stanley analyst pointed to Tesla’s Supercharger network, the company’s eclectic charging station network, as an advantage over its competition. Jonas also restated that he believes technology companies, and not other car markers, will prove to be Tesla’s biggest competition.On top of the Morgan Stanley upgrade, Baird’s Ben Kallo reiterated his Tesla “outperform” rating on Monday. Kallo also raised his Tesla price target to $411 per share from $368 per share.""We expect strong demand for the Model 3 and believe the total addressable market will likely be underestimated, but think it will be an ongoing process to ascertain global demand,"" Kallo wrote in a note. ""We think the large US market will support sales of the Model 3, and significant additional opportunities exist internationally.""Kallo pointed out that Tesla’s net orders jumped to 1,800 per day after the first Model 3s were delivered recently to Tesla employees. He also noted that CEO Elon Musk is confident that Tesla can produce 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week within the next year.The Baird analyst pointed to Tesla’s other business segments, such as solar energy, as potential long-term strengths. ""We continue to believe Tesla Energy may be underappreciated by investors, and think the segment could be as important as the auto business over the long term,"" Kallo noted.Shares of Tesla jumped over 2% in early morning trading on Monday, yet the stock has leveled off a bit since then. Tesla is currently a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).Despite the bullish Tesla takes on Monday, a New York University finance professor said on Friday that he thinks one of the company’s recent moves is very strange. Aswath Damodaran, who is regarded as a company valuation expert said he doesn’t understand why a company that is losing cash, like Tesla, chose to raise its debt total and not sell stock.Tesla raised $1.8 billion in bond offerings on Friday from underwriter Goldman Sachs. The deal came in $300 million above projections. The company made the move to help reach its massive Model 3 production goals.“If you look at the trade off, you can see quickly that Tesla is singularly unsuited to using debt,” Damodaran wrote in a blog post on Friday. “It is a company that is not only still losing money but has carried forward losses of close to $4.3 billion, effectively nullifying any tax benefits from debt for the near future (by my estimates, at least seven years)… While the benefits from debt are low to non-existent, the costs are immense.”Damodaran raised his fair value Tesla estimate to $192 a share from $151 a share.Bottom LineTesla stock has climbed from $213.69 per share at the end December to the $363.89 per share it rests at today.

2192,MS,"As we mull earnings reports from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) from Tuesday afternoon and more Wall Street investment firms this morning, we also see fresh data on June Housing Starts and Permits. Both headline numbers came in hotter than expected: 1.215 million on June starts (up 8.3%) and 1.254 million in permits (up 7.4%). (These results are seasonally adjusted and annualized.)Housing Starts in May also saw a positive revision from 1.09 million units to 1.12 million. Analysts had only expected a 5.5% increase in starts and just 1.7% in permits. Starts were bolstered by a strong 849K in single-family housing. All this said, we are still well off the multi-year highs of roughly 2 million annualized housing starts per month.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped estimates on both top and bottom lines ahead of the bell this morning: 87 cents per share beat the 76 cents expected, and the $9.5 billion in revenues easily surpassed the $8.9 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. These results beat fairly low bars for Morgan in the quarter, however: our consensus earnings estimate for Q2 had tumbled more than 10% in the past month.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for its Q2 earnings and revenues, albeit more slightly: 85 cents per share beat by a penny, and revenues of $5.49 billion outperformed the $5.46 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is a very typical quarterly performance for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock: the trailing 4-quarter average earnings beat — in which the bank topped expectations each time — was 1.55%.Wednesday after the bell will give us a breather of sorts, with American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS  -  Free Report) reporting after the bell, but the real marquee names of earnings season begin after the bell with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Thursday afternoon, and then the dam really breaks open next week.

2195,MS,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 7.5% in second-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. The adjusted figure excludes restructuring charges and tax benefit from employee stock transactions.Better-than-expected results reflect higher revenues and lower expenses. Moreover, lower provisions and better credit quality were the tailwinds. A strong capital position was another positive.Adjusted net income came in at $206 million, up 50.4% year over year. This figure includes $5 million of tax benefits from employee stock transactions and a restructuring charge of $9 million.Segment wise, on a year-over-year basis, net income increased 19.2% at Business Bank and 76.9% at Wealth Management. Retail Bank segment reported net income of $16 million against a net loss of $2 million in the prior-year quarter. However, the Finance segment recorded net loss in the quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses DeclineComerica’s net revenue for the quarter was $776 million, up 8.8% year over year. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $770.8 million.Net interest income increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis to $500 million. Moreover, net interest margin expanded 29 basis points (bps) to 3.03%.Total non-interest income came in at $276 million, up 3.0% on a year-over-year basis. Increased card fees, fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts primarily led to the rise.Further, non-interest expenses totaled $457 million, down 11.8% year over year. The fall was chiefly due to lower salaries, benefit expenses and restructuring charges, partly offset by increased processing fees and other expenses.Loans Increase, Deposits DeclineAs of Jun 30, 2017, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $71.4 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, compared with $73.0 billion and $7.9 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.Total loans were up 2.3% on a sequential basis, to $49.4 billion. However, total deposits decreased 3.5% from the previous quarter to $56.8 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets decreased 18.3% year over year to $519 million. Also, allowance for loan losses was $705 million, down 3.3% from the prior-year period. Additionally, the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1.43% as of Jun 30, 2017, down 2 bps year over year.Further, net loan charge-offs declined 61.7% on a year-over-year basis to $18 million. In addition, provision for credit losses declined 65.3% year over year to $17 million.Capital Position StrengthensThe company's tangible common equity ratio improved 39 bps year over year to 10.37% as of Jun 30, 2017. Further, common equity Tier 1 and tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.51%, up from 10.49% in the prior-year quarter. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.66%, up 92 bps from the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateNotably, during the reported quarter, Comerica repurchased 2 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $185 million to shareholders.Impressive Outlook for 2017Comerica provided following guidance for 2017 assuming continuation of the current economic environment and the persistent low rates, along with contributions from the GEAR Up initiative of $30 million in revenues and $125 million in expense savings:The company anticipates higher net interest income, including the benefit of short-term rate increase in Dec 2016, Mar 2017 and Jun 2017, loan growth and debt maturities. Notably, the recent rise in short-term rates is likely to be over $30 million for the upcoming quarters, assuming a 25% deposit beta.Non-interest income is expected to increase 4–6%. The rise is expected on GEAR Up opportunities, modest growth in treasury management and card fees, along with wealth management products, including fiduciary and brokerage services.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be lower, excluding an estimated $40–$50 million restructuring expense. Notably, an additional $125 million in GEAR Up savings is expected. Technology costs and typical inflationary pressure can be offsetting factors. Including restructuring charges, expenses are projected to decrease about 4%.Provision for credit losses is likely to remain low, with steady performance in overall portfolio. Notably, net charge-offs are expected to remain low while provisions are expected to be in the range of 20–25 bps.Income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately 31% of pre-tax income on the assumption of no tax impact from employee stock transactions.Comerica expects average loan growth to be 1%. Management expects loan growth to be 3%, if Mortgage Banker Finance and Energy segments are excluded.Our ViewpointThe company should benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Additionally, its improving credit quality should support its financials in the quarters ahead. Further, the top-line continues to benefit from loan growth and easing pressure on margins.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Comerica has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2196,MS,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is making waves on Monday amid new reports involving the technology giant, including the possibility that its upcoming iPhone could be delayed.Shares of Apple rose marginally in morning trading despite new reports that the iPhone 8, the much-anticipated 10th anniversary edition of the phone, might be delayed. A DigiTimes piece, which cites the Economic Daily News, was the first to report on Monday that production on Apple’s newest iPhone could be postponed.“Production of the OLED-version next-generation iPhone will be delayed to November-December, shipping only in small volumes initially, according to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) report… Volume production of the 4.7- and 5.5-inch models at Foxconn and Pegatron are now expected to enter full swing in August, 1-2 months later than the normal mass production schedules of new iPhone devices in previous years,” the report said.According to the report, Apple’s iPhones would not hit the market until right before the pivotal holiday season based on the updated production timetable.Wall Street has also expected delays to the new iPhone. Analysts now project the phone to make its debut after September – the month Apple traditionally unveils its new iPhones. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) analyst Katy Huberty wrote in a note to clients on Monday that there is ""increasing evidence OLED iPhone launches in October, rather than September.""""In light of the most meaningful feature and technology upgrades in iPhone's history — including OLED displays, wireless charging, and 3D sensors for AR — we believe it's reasonable to assume the new, higher-priced OLED iPhone ships in October rather than September.""However, according to Huberty, the possibility of iPhone 8 delays won’t decrease the demand for the new phone.The company’s phones advance from model to model, but the jump from the iPhone 7 to Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is projected to be massive.The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature an OLED – organic light-emitting diode – screen that takes up the whole phone, which means no front-facing button. Apple’s new phone is set to feature a 3-D face scanner, which is said to have contributed to production delays. Wireless charging is also scheduled to make its Apple debut for the new iPhone.Apple’s new iPhone might cost as much as $1,200, which is almost double the price of the iPhone 7.iPhone 7s & More EmojisJust for good measure, or to make up the possibility of delays to the iPhone 8, the tech powerhouse is scheduled to launch its now-customary iPhone updates on time. The new versions of its current iPhone models, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, are set to debut in September.On top of all the other news, Apple helped celebrate World Emoji Day by previewing the company’s new batch of emojis for iOS, macOS, and watchOS that will debut later this year.Apple’s new emojis feature a bearded man, a woman breastfeeding, a woman in a headscarf, and a man meditating. Some of the more goofy emojis include a zombie, an elf, and a T-Rex. There will also be more food options including coconut and steak emojis.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2197,MS,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While investors cheered its enhanced capital deployment plan, we don’t think this optimism will continue following the earnings release.While Morgan Stanley’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues and higher investment banking fees, a challenging operating backdrop is expected to dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 2.5% downward, over the last seven days. Nonetheless, the company’s revenues and earnings are expected to grow modestly year over year.Also, Morgan Stanley boasts a decent earnings surprise history. This is evident from the chart below:Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteEarnings WhispersDeclining earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 76 cents.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Impact Q2 Results  Trading income slump on low volatility: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish largely due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a modest increase in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for Morgan Stanley to record any improvement in trading revenues.Underwriting fees to record a slight rise: Driven by an improving market conditions, the second quarter witnessed an increase in equity issuance while debt issuance was hit by higher interest rates. Per the data compiled by Thomson Reuters, equity market activities led to more than nearly 22% rise in equity underwriting fees, with Morgan Stanley at the top spot (recording over 50% growth in fees).However, the data indicates that global fees related to bond activity roughly totaled $6.5 billion during the second quarter, down more than 16% year over year. So, Morgan Stanley should have recorded a decline in debt underwriting fees during the quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees is expected to witness a slight rise on the basis of improved equity markets.Advisory fee revenues to suffer: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Thus, total fees earned through deal making should have declined as well. Likewise, Morgan Stanley is expected to earn $372.1 million as advisory fees in the quarter, indicating a fall of 20.9% from the prior-year quarter.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income as well.Support to bottom line from expense control: Morgan Stanley has a cost savings plan – Project Streamline – in place. This is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18. It has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBAN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 25.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2198,MS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Morgan Stanley Beats Q2 Earnings on Equity Trading GainContinued strength in equity trading drove Morgan Stanley’s second-quarter 2017 earnings of 87 cents per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. The reported figure was 16% above the prior-year quarter.Higher underwriting fees, growth in equity trading income and stable advisory fees were primarily responsible for the significant improvement in earnings. Also, the company’s capital ratios remained strong.However as expected, fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) income declined. Further, lower net interest income (owing to a fall in corporate loans) and a rise in operating expenses acted as headwinds.Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.8 billion, up 11% year over year.Equity Trading Improvement Supports Revenues, Costs RiseNet revenue amounted to $9.5 billion, a rise of 7% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.3 billion.Net interest income was $751 million, down 18% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely due to a drastic rise in interest expenses. However, total non-interest revenues of $8.8 billion grew 7% year over year, primarily supported by improvement in trading and investments.Total non-interest expenses were $6.9 billion, up 7% year over year. The rise was due to a 6% increase in compensation and benefits costs as well as 29% jump in other expenses.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion, down 4% year over year. Net revenue of $4.8 billion rose 4% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly driven by a significant increase in underwriting income and equity trading revenues as well as stable advisory income, partially offset by decline in FICC income.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, a jump of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue was $4.2 billion, up 9% year over year, driven by higher asset management fee revenues and net interest income, partly offset by a fall in transactional revenues.Investment Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $142 million, jumping 20% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue was $665 million, a rise of 14% year over year. The increase reflected higher investment revenues and asset management fees.As of Jun 30, 2017, total assets under management or supervision were $435 billion, up 7% on a year-over-year basis.Strong Capital PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, book value per share was $38.22, up from $36.29 as of Jun 30, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $33.24, up from $31.39 as of Jun 30, 2016. Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 capital ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 18.9%, up from 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 common equity ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 16.6% compared with 16.8% in the prior-year quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley bought back around 12 million shares for nearly $500 million. This was part of the company's 2016 capital plan.OutlookManagement expects revenue growth of 3–5% annually through 2017. Also, net interest income is expected to keep rising in the upcoming quarters driven by efficient deployment of deposits and rise in interest rates.  Further, management affirmed its target of $4 billion yearly revenue from its fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) unit despite its downsizing in the recent years. On the M&A front, pipelines and client dialogs are expected to remain strong. Equity and bond underwriting volumes are projected to improve in the upcoming quarters.Management expects equity activity levels to remain healthy although near-term issuances could be impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties and a typical summer slowdown.In Wealth Management segment, Morgan Stanley projects the stability and trends of last several quarters to continue. In Investment Management segment, it anticipates asset management fees to remain stable with potential unevenness in the investments line.Morgan Stanley targets compensation to net revenue ratio (under flat rate environment) of 37% or below for Institutional Securities, 56% or below for Wealth Management and 40% or below for Investment Management.Management expects efficiency ratio target of 74% for 2017. This is based on the assumptions of flat revenues. However, the company does not expect the flat revenue environment to continue, especially given the ongoing growth initiatives.Further, the company remains on track for its company-wide initiative called Project Streamline. This will help in reducing expense by $1 billion by the end of 2017.In the Wealth Management segment, the company expects to achieve margin of 23–25% in 2017 supported by loan and deposit growth, expense discipline and business growth and the interest rate increases in the future.  The company expects effective tax rate of 32–33% in 2017.The company targets a ROE of 9–11% for 2017 on the assumptions that there are no material new capital requirements, no outside new litigation expenses or penalties, and global economic growth.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Morgan Stanley Price and Consensus  Morgan Stanley Price and Consensus | Morgan Stanley QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

2199,MS,"The Trump administration’s failure to push through a new healthcare law has possibly sandbagged hopes of policy measures boosting stocks in the near future. In fact, investors now have little confidence left in the President’s pre-poll promises and are starting to bank on fundamental concerns when evaluating investment options. Needless to say, earnings performance and the state of the economy feature at the top of a list of such factors.Meanwhile, market watchers now believe that a falling dollar is just the tonic markets need. The decline in the greenback could provide equities with fresh upside by boosting earnings of commodity-centric and multinational companies. In a volatile scenario, investing in stocks of this nature, which are large enough to be included in the S&P 500, makes for a profitable option.Policy Paralysis Fells DollarThe dollar’s recent set of declines has provided analysts with an opportunity to determine whether it could have a positive effect on corporate earnings. To understand the gravity of the situation, one need to look no further than the U.S. Dollar Index, which is down 8% year to date. In comparison, the S&P 500% has already gained 10.3% over the same period.Immediately after Trump’s surprise victory, the dollar soared on hopes that the President’s growth-oriented and industry-friendly policies would boost the economy and earnings. However, repeated failures at pushing through policy proposals have left investors somewhat disenchanted. With little headway made on tax reforms, fiscal stimulus measures and a new healthcare law, the so called “Trump Trade” has experienced a reversal, leading to the greenback’s decline.Falling Dollar to Boost EarningsInstead, investors have chosen to focus on the state of the economy, the reluctance of the Fed to raise rates and a likely strong second quarter earnings season. And a clutch of analysts now feel that a softer dollar is just the tonic earnings need.While earnings felt the heat of a soaring dollar last year, a decline could be extremely beneficial this time around. Additionally, this phenomenon illustrates how expectations about the extent to which the Fed could hike rates have undergone a change.A fall in the dollar usually has a positive impact on the price of commodities. This is why companies which stand to gain handsomely from the dollar’s decline are those whose businesses are commodity centric or multinationals with significant overseas exposure. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), S&P 500 earnings could increase by 0.5% for every 1% decline in the dollar.The financial major explained that this factor impacts earnings on a rolling basis and its effects could become apparent in the second half of the year.  By this logic, an 8% decline in the dollar’s value by the end of the current year could boost 2018 earnings by 4%. If, as Morgan Stanley projects, the dollar declines by an additional 5%, earnings could grow by around 6.5%Our ChoicesCorporate earnings are likely to receive a welcome boost from the plunge in the dollar’s value.

2201,MS,"The financial sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the S&P 500 index, is now busy with Q2 earnings releases. The going is good so far, with five big banks crushing estimates on both lines and Wells Fargo beating on earnings but missing on revenues.The Zacks Sector Rank for some top banks is in the top 19%. However, the downtrend in the benchmark U.S. Treasury yields in recent times thanks to a dovish Fed rate hike outlook and geopolitical risks are concern for the banking sector. Let’s take a look at banking earnings in detail:Big Bank Earnings in FocusRising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings to $1.82 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. Also, the figure reflects a 17% rise from the year-ago period. Managed net revenue of $26.4 billion was up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.8 billion. An 8% jump in interest income spurred by rising rates and an advancement in the number of loans facilitated revenue improvement.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) reported 2% year-over-year expansion in revenues to $17.9 billion helped by the retail division and investment banking. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.3 billion. The company’s income from continuing operations per share of $1.27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.9% in the second quarter.

The quarter’s total revenue was $22.2 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion but in line with the prior-year quarter figure. Wells Fargo witnessed a slump in car loans and tighter lending standards hurt the segment, going by article published on BBC News. Lending was also stagnant.Driven by increase in net revenues in equity securities, The Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) reported earnings per share of $3.95 in the second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36. Further, the bottom line witnessed 6% year-over-year improvement. Goldman’s net revenue edged down 1% year over year to $7.89 billion in the quarter under review. However, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.57 billion.However, lower fixed income revenues were a drag. Goldman’s FICC trading recorded its lowest revenue in any single quarter since 2008. Institutional Client Services division and Investment Banking division suffered in the quarter.Higher investment banking fees as well as loan growth can be attributed to Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.46 per share. The figure was 12% higher than the prior-year quarter. Net revenue amounted to $23.1 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.9 billion.

2203,MS,"Continued strength in equity trading drove Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 87 cents per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. The reported figure was 16% above the prior-year quarter.Shares of Morgan Stanley have gained nearly 4% in early market trading, largely driven by impressive growth in equity trading income and investment banking. The stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Higher underwriting fees, growth in equity trading income and stable advisory fees were primarily responsible for the significant improvement in earnings. Also, the company’s capital ratios remained strong.However as expected, fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) income declined. Further, lower net interest income (owing to a fall in corporate loans) and a rise in operating expenses acted as headwinds.Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1.8 billion, up 11% year over year.Equity Trading Improvement Supports Revenues, Costs RiseNet revenue amounted to $9.5 billion, a rise of 7% from the prior-year quarter. In addition, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.3 billion.Net interest income was $751 million, down 18% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely due to a drastic rise in interest expenses. However, total non-interest revenues of $8.8 billion grew 7% year over year, primarily supported by improvement in trading and investments.Total non-interest expenses were $6.9 billion, up 7% year over year. The rise was due to a 6% increase in compensation and benefits costs as well as 29% jump in other expenses.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1.4 billion, down 4% year over year. Net revenue of $4.8 billion rose 4% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly driven by a significant increase in underwriting income and equity trading revenues as well as stable advisory income, partially offset by decline in FICC income.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, a jump of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenue was $4.2 billion, up 9% year over year, driven by higher asset management fee revenues and net interest income, partly offset by a fall in transactional revenues.Investment Management: Pre-tax income from continuing operations was $142 million, jumping 20% from the year-ago quarter. Net revenue was $665 million, a rise of 14% year over year. The increase reflected higher investment revenues and asset management fees.As of Jun 30, 2017, total assets under management or supervision were $435 billion, up 7% on a year-over-year basis.Strong Capital PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, book value per share was $38.22, up from $36.29 as of Jun 30, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $33.24, up from $31.39 as of Jun 30, 2016.Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 capital ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 18.9%, up from 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 common equity ratio Advanced (Transitional) was 16.6% compared with 16.8% in the prior-year quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley bought back around 12 million shares for nearly $500 million. This was part of the company's 2016 capital plan.Dividend HikeAs part of its 2017 capital plan, Morgan Stanley announced quarterly dividend of 25 cents. This represents a 25% hike from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Aug 15 to shareholder of record as of Jul 31.Our TakeMorgan Stanley’s initiatives to offload its non-core assets, in order to lower balance-sheet risks and shift focus toward less capital-incentive operations are commendable. However, continued decline in interest income despite an improving rate scenario remains a near-term concern. Also, decline in bond trading fees owing to low client activity is an issue.Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteCurrently, Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other banking giants, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Particular success could be seen in the Institutional Securities Segment, which includes investment banking and stock and bond sales and trading, as the group reported record pre-tax income of $3.0 billion, up 71% from the year-ago period. 
"
2226,MS,"In December, the company announced plans to spin-off its Discover unit in order to focus on the core businesses of investment banking and asset management. The credit card company has performed poorly relative to competitors, most recently posting a 22% decline in year-over-year pre-tax income. 
"
2227,MS,"Concern of late has centered on the banks exposure to the subprime mortgage sector; however, CFO David Sidwell commented that the mortgage business was a significant contributor in the recent earnings announcement. In addition, he believes the problems in the subprime markets wont spread. We believe this could be a reasonably limited event, as we have not seen any signs that the subprime deterioration has spread to other parts of the market. 
"
2228,MS,"The Mar 21 report marked the sixth consecutive double-digit earnings surprise. As a result of the companys consistent earnings momentum, analysts have increased estimates repeatedly throughout the year. Most recently, expectations have been revised on two occasions and currently stand at $7.83, up 59 cents from pre-earnings release levels. 
"
2229,MS,"MS is currently trading at 10.4x current fiscal-year estimated earnings, a substantial discount to the S&P 500 multiple of 15.6x and respective industry multiple of 16.2x. Furthermore, the company trades at 10.0x next fiscal-year estimated earnings, still under the respective market multiple of 14.4x. In addition, the company has a Price to Book Ratio of 2.5x, well below the S&P 500 Price to Book of 4.3x. While trading at a discount to both the market and the industry, Morgan Stanley has a ROE of 25.8%, well above the industry average of 14.5%.
"
2230,MS,"While Alcoas (AA) negative surprise last Tuesday got the official beginning of the third-quarter earnings season on a sour note, most of the news has been positive. To date, 42 companies out of the S&P 500 have reported and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. Positive EPS surprises have outnumbered negatives by 6:1 and the median surprise is an impressive 3.7%. With the Dow hitting new highs and energy prices continuing to trend downward, the market seems to be shrugging off fears of a near-term recession. As reports ramp up however, it will be much easier to see how corporate earnings performance matches up with the markets renewed bullishness. 
"
2231,MS,"So far, the sectors seeing the largest number of companies reporting have been Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary. Firms with double digit upside surprises include Circuit City (CC), Mccormick (MKC  -  Free Report), and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report). No firms in either sector reported a negative surprise. The Tech sector has also seen excellent EPS performance thus far with a median surprise of nearly 9.4%. The surprise ratio stands at 5:1. Adobe and Tektronix lead the charge, with 13.6% and 14.3% respective EPS surprises. 
"
2232,MS,"For the full S&P 500, analysts are expecting 8.6% median third-quarter growth. If this growth rate proves accurate, it will be much lower than the 12.9% growth seen last quarter. However, going into each of the last two quarters, growth was expected to be much lower than it later proved to be. Much of the shortfall is due to Energy. This cooling sector was able to post 65.6% growth last quarter but is only expected to deliver 21.2% growth in the third quarter. Much of the shortfall is obviously due to the difference in comparable energy prices caused by last years hurricane season. Fourth-quarter growth estimates for the sector are expected to be even lower, at 8.3%. For the full S&P 500 however, fourth-quarter comparable growth rates are expected to tick slightly upward, to 11.1% for the median firm. The growth rates shown in the table below include only those firms which have already reported.

2234,MS," The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 1,379. This is down from the 3,243 at the peak of the second-quarter reporting season, a level we will most likely ramp up to over the next month. At the current time, it is clear that there is less new data for analyst to work with and thus, fewer EPS revisions. 
"
2235,MS,"Over the last four weeks, there were 704 upward revisions and 675 downward. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.04, up from last weeks 0.90. The uptrend has continued now for several weeks and the 2006 revisions ratio is once again above 1. Continued positive EPS surprises could boost the ratio back to levels we saw during the peak of Q2 earnings reports. Six weeks ago, for example, the ratio was 1.35. 
"
2236,MS,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Energys ratio is at the bottom of the barrel, at 0.33. Two weeks ago, energys ratio was 1.15. Negative revisions were across the board here, from the super majors  Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)  to the independents (Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) to the drillers and refiners (Rowan (RDC  -  Free Report) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report)).
"
2237,MS,"The weakness in oil and gas prices is clearly to blame for the sharp slide in the sector. On the upside of the revisions story, the Financials sector once again saw a sharp week-to-week ratio increase, from 1.60 to 1.91. Behemoth investment banks like Lehman (LEH), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report)each had double-digit positive revisions following strong third-quarter reports. Other financials, such as Allstate (ALL) and XL Capital ((XL  -  Free Report)) also boasted strong double digit analyst revisions.

2239,MS,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio is notably lower, at 0.89. This is slightly higher than the 0.80 reported last week. Less than two months ago however, the ratio was 1.26. If the ratio stays at its current level as the total number of revisions picks up in the Q3 earnings season, I would start to get very concerned. Conversely, if the ratio rises back above one in the heart of the reporting season, I will become much more positive about the outlook for both the economy and the market. However, slightly more firms enjoyed upward revisions than suffered a decline over the last month. 
"
2240,MS,"The bright point this week regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Utilities. The sectors ratio is a sky-high 3.0. Though this ratio is based on a paltry 22 revisions, the positive numbers are spread evenly across the sectors firms. Revisions across the board from companies like KeySpan (KSE) and TXU (TXU) have helped loft the sector forward. The longer fossil fuel prices stay low, the more likely utilities are to negotiate favorable supply contracts and secure higher forward margins.

"
2242,MS,"On a full-year  basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.1% and 12.9%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.1% versus 10.4% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 10.4% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near-term recession. On the other hand, if the recent trend toward more downward revisions than upward revisions continues, those expected growth rates will deteriorate.
"
2243,MS,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. As mentioned above, stock options expensing counteracts this effect, and depresses the 2005 versus 2006 EPS comparisons. 
"
2244,MS,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 34% this year and over 20% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors (XOM, CVX, COP) account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Health Care sectors combined.

"
2246,MS,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
2247,MS,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
2248,MS,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.7%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
2249,MS,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 8.9% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14.0% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 8.9%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only 40% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
2250,MS,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.5% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 43.8% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 9.7x 2006, and 9.0x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.4x 2006 and 19.1x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.7x and 14.2x, respectively. The P/E for 2007 equates to an earnings yield of 7.0% which is very attractive relative to a 10 year t-note yield of 4.8%. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.
"
2251,MS,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report. 
"
2252,MS,"The third quarter earnings season is beginning, first with a trickle, but it will soon turn into a flood. For the 25 companies reported thus far, 22 have reported above expectations. Negative revisions for both this year and next however, put a shade of grey on these preliminary results. Our revisions ratio, which is calculated by dividing positive analysts revisions by negatives, is below one. This means that of the 1,250 fiscal 2006 analysts revisions compiled over the last four weeks, 657 were negative. This gives an 2006 EPS revisions ratio of 0.90. While the rise in the revisions ratio is good news, eight of the ten sectors had negative revisions ratios for the year, with only the financials showing significant strength. The ratio for fiscal 2007 is even worse, at 0.80. On the bright side, the 2006 revisions ratio has been climbing for the past two weeks, after having bottomed out at 0.71. The unfavorable 2007 ratio however, has held solid at its current value. If both ratios remain at their current levels as third quarter reporting picks up, it could be the canary in the coal mine. The high expected earnings growth rates indicate that the economy will remain healthy, despite disturbing indicators such as an inverted yield curve and a plunging housing market. So far the negative revisions ratios have yet to put a meaningful dent in the earnings expectations. This is mostly due to the low absolute numbers of revisions during this slow season.
"
2253,MS,"The S&P 500 is set to post double-digit median growth for both this year and next. This is true regardless if measured on a total net income basis or a median firm basis. Current downward revisions would have to lower EPS values substantially and across multiple industries before our overall earnings outlook turns bearish. 
"
2254,MS,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month, as mentioned above, was 1,250. This is down from the 3,243 at the peak of the second quarter reporting season, a level we will most likely ramp up to over the next month. At current levels, it is clear that there is less new data for analyst to work with and thus, fewer EPS revisions. 
"
2255,MS,"Over the last four weeks, there were 593 upward revisions and 657 downward. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 0.90, slightly up from last weeks 0.82. The downtrend has now been reversed and the full-year 2006 revisions ratio is headed upward. Strong third quarter earnings could once again loft it well above 1, which is where it sat during most of the second quarter reporting season. The ratio was 1.35 five weeks ago. 
"
2256,MS,"The revisions ratio should be looked at in combination with two other metrics. The first is the average four-week change in EPS estimates. The average 2006 estimate change during the past month remains slightly negative, at -0.29%. This estimate change pretty much mirrors the revisions ratio in being a bearish signal, though not quite as extreme. 
"
2257,MS,"The other useful ratio we utilize compares the number of firms with EPS increases versus decreases. This ratio has now been negative for two weeks and currently sits at 0.96. The big story here is energy. 21 companies in the sector saw analyst decreasing full-year EPS numbers, compared to only four companies with increasing estimates. As can be clearly seen with oils recent swoon from nearly $80 a barrel to just under $60, the fossil fuel boom has come down from its peak. Whether this is temporary or not is someone elses argument to take on. It has however, had a drastic effect on the outlook for companies in the oil patch. 
"
2258,MS,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Energy saw a sharp decline, as would be expected. The ratio was a dismal 0.30. Two weeks ago, energys ratio was 1.15. Negative revisions were across the board here, from the super majors (Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)) to the independents (Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) to the drillers and refiners (Rowan (COP  -  Free Report) and Valero (COP  -  Free Report)).. On the upside of the revisions story, the Financials sector once again saw a sharp week-to-week ratio increase, from 1.10 to 1.60. Behemoth investment banks like Lehman (LEH), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) each had double-digit positive revisions following strong third quarter reports.

2263,MS,"While earnings revisions and average EPS estimate changes have been negative indicators recently, the small amount of third-quarter reports coming in have been positive. We define a third quarter earnings report as having an end date in either August, September or October. 
"
2264,MS,"25 companies have reported third-quarter earnings and 22 of them have had positive surprises. The median surprise is 6.1% and the median company growth rate is 15.1%. Note that these numbers are not very significant in the grand scheme since they only represent 5% of the S&P 500. Still, positive surprises are positive surprises, and bulls should be crossing their fingers for more of the same. All in all, the pattern looks remarkably similar to three months ago, when earnings growth for the quarter was expected to drop to single-digits, and the early reports where overwhelmingly positive. The first quarter also followed a similar pattern. If this pattern of positive surprises keeps up, the revisions ratio will increase, and previous growth forecasts will prove accurate, or possibly even conservative. This would be terrific news for the economy.

"
2272,MS,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
2273,MS,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
2274,MS,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.8%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.4% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
2275,MS,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 8.9% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.9% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 8.9%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only 40% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
2276,MS,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.5% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 43.8% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 9.5x 2006, and 9.0x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 21.9x 2006 and 18.7x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.6x and 14.1x, respectively. The P/E for 2007 equates to an earnings yield of 7.1% which is very attractive relative to a 10 year t-note yield of 4.7%. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

2320,MS,"Ever since the economic recovery began, the leading internal cause of concern among market watchers has been the inevitable rise of interest rates.  The drumbeat to the June Fed meeting, where a vast consensus believe rates will begin to rise, has taken a larger toll on some industries than others.  The brokerage houses industry is one of those spaces where Fed policy becomes nerve-wracking.  Nevertheless, the space still enjoys a Zacks Industry rank of 2.55, according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  which places it 35th out of more than 200 industries.  All of the analysts are paying close attention to rates right now, but many of them also feel the hype has been overblown and the industry continues to exhibit positive trends. 
"
2321,MS,"May experienced a bit of a rebound for brokerage stocks after a rather disappointing April.  Brokerage stocks gained about +2% during the month, almost doubling an approximate +1% gain for the S&P 500.  Over the next couple of weeks, a number of companies will be reporting second quarter numbers, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.  Analysts expect these companies to at least meet and probably beat the earnings expectations set by Wall Street.  However, they caution that these second quarter results will not be as robust as the first quarters.  In addition to the interest rate paranoia and the typical summer swoon, the numbers must contend with an unusually successful first quarter where, by some accounts, brokers saw a more than +60% jump in earnings per share from the prior year.   
"
2322,MS,"The good news for the industry moving forward is analysts believe the short-term sluggishness is temporary in nature, and the longer-term outlook for this space remains positive.  Our economy, as well as many others around the globe are improving, and rising interest rates do not necessarily mean the end of the recovery.  There are, of course, external factors that must be considered, such as the Iraq situation and rising oil prices, which usually do not inspire much desire for investing.  But many are convinced that the strong fundamentals will be enough to boost this space after the summer burns itself out, and it wouldnt hurt if some of the countrys geopolitical strife eased as well. 
"
2323,MS,"With so many factors that could potentially impact the brokerage houses industry, investors would be wise to ask for some help when entering the space.  The economy is moving in the right direction, and these companies are in a good position to capitalize on that strength, but there are obstacles that must be considered.

2325,MS,"Below are some of the top-ranked stocks recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts in the brokerage houses industry.  Whether they reported in April, or will report in June, its clear to see that these companies have been performing above Wall Streets expectations for a while now. Read the following paragraphs to see if any of these companies can find a home in your portfolio.  Citigroup  (NYSE:  C ), the preeminent global financial services company, has some 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 100 countries, providing consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, insurance, securities brokerage, and asset management.  Excluding an after-tax gain, Citigroup reported first quarter earnings of 98 cents per diluted share.  Analysts were expecting the company to post 94 cents, marking a more than +4% surprise.  The positive quarterly surprise was the companys fifth consecutive.  Revenues in the quarter increased +16% to $21.49 billion.  Citigroup achieved double-digit income growth in each of its nine products as well as in every on of its regions, reflecting a focus on increasing customer volumes while maintaining expense discipline and improving credit performance.

Merrill Lynch  (NYSE:  MER ) is one of the worlds leading financial management and advisory companies with offices in 35 countries and total client assets of approximately $1.5 trillion.

For the past six quarters, this company has been able to surpass Wall Streets earnings expectations.  In its first quarter report from mid-March, the company earned $1.11 per diluted share, compared to 82 cents in the year-earlier period.  The result was almost +17% better than what a consensus of analysts were expecting at the time.  Net revenues advanced +14% year-over-year to $6.2 billion.  That also marked a +23% sequential increase.  Philip J. Purcell, Chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley stated, We had an excellent first quarter with a return on equity of 19%, driven by record revenues in a number of businesses and impressive market share gains in investment banking.  Our sales and trading businesses continue to perform very well, retail securities and investment management posted strong results and Discover Card had a record quarter.

2326,MS,"Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), whose majority stockholder is Morgan Stanley, completed the acquisition of Barra, Inc., a global leader in delivering risk management systems and services to managers of portfolio and firm-wide investment risk.

MSCI stated the combination will be a research powerhouse, and it looks forward to beginning a new chapter of innovation in providing solutions to clients worldwide.

Goldman Sachs is preparing to report its fiscal second quarter results on June 22nd  also, as it seeks to post its sixth consecutive quarter of surpassing Wall Streets earnings expectations.  Late March had the company reporting first quarter diluted earnings of $2.50 per share, which was more than enough to exceed the year-ago total of $1.29 while easily sliding past the consensus by more than +50%.  Investment banking net revenues rose to $763 million in the quarter from $718 million last year, while trading and principal investments net revenues jumped +47% to $4.12 billion and asset management and securities services improved to $1.04 billion from $666 million.  While the environment for fixed income remained robust throughout the period, we saw significantly higher revenues in our equity-related businesses, as well as an increase in corporate activity levels, said Henry M. Paulson, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs.  Also in the quarter, Goldman Sachs continued its leadership in global mergers and acquisitions, ranking first in announced and completed transactions.

2327,MS,"Perhaps one of the few saving graces of an economic downturn is that companies are forced to become more efficient, and thereby are put into prime positions to prosper once conditions improve.  During our most recent foray into the doldrums, equities were not high on the priority list for many people, nor were many other services offered by brokerage houses for that matter.  But now with the economy back on course, and the efficiency programs in place, the brokerage firms industry enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.50, according to Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,""  placing it 16th out of more than 200 industries. 
"
2328,MS,"""The companies are doing pretty well,"" said 5-Star analyst Jeffery Harte, senior research analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P.  ""There's an evolving recovery at the corporate activity level, and companies are taking out operating expenses and getting more efficient.""   
"
2329,MS,"As many companies and industries had to do during the downturn, brokerage firms saw the writing on the wall and decided to pull back on expenses.  The economy was on the ropes and the market was down for the count, which left consumers, and former investors, grappling to stay on their feet.  But while there were signs that the economy was slowly but surely recovering in the second half of 2003, the +8.2% GDP surge in the third quarter seemed to crystallize the idea that better days were ahead.  A glimpse at the last two quarters for this industry's big boys shows their confidence that the tide has turned.   
"
2330,MS,"""We've essentially just moved through the door of this recovery,"" said Harte, who says that it should have legs moving into the future.  He expects a strong 2004 and a decent 2005.  At this time of rising revenues, Harte is looking for companies with a low valuation and a position to exceed profit margins.   
"
2331,MS,"As Harte sees it, the main risk to this recovery is if the recovery falters.  There are currently numerous theories as to the sustainability of the rise, with a special interest now on the lack of job growth.  The tempo of this debate will only become louder as the presidential election heats up.  But most of the companies in the space appear to be rather optimistic for the future.  One of the best ways to guard against making unwise decisions - whether they be company specific or concerning the economy in general - is to consult the Wall Street analysts that make it their business to know the present and future conditions of your profit potential.

Top Consensus Stocks  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:  GS ) is a global investment banking and securities firm, providing a full range of investing, advisory and financing services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base, which includes corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high net worth individuals.  Last month, Goldman Sachs posted fourth quarter net earnings of $971 million, or earnings per share of $1.89.  That EPS report surpassed the year-ago total of 98 cents and beat the consensus by more than +24%.  That quarter capped off a successful year for Goldman Sachs, as 2003 net earnings of $3.01 billion, or $5.87 per diluted share, surpassed the year-ago performance of $4.03.  During the year, Goldman Sachs kept its top spot in global mergers and acquisitions, advising on seven of the largest ten deals completed in 2003.  Furthermore, the company ranked first in worldwide equity and equity-related offerings, as well as in worldwide initial public offerings, while ranking second in worldwide public common stock offerings.

Through Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, the company is one of the world's largest managers of financial assets.  Yesterday, Merrill Lynch reported its highest-ever annual net earnings, which came in at $4 billion for 2003, marking a +59% jump from $2.5 billion in 2002.  Earnings per diluted share advanced to $4.05 from $2.63 while net revenues improved +8% to $20.2 billion.  For the fourth quarter, Merrill Lynch posted net earnings of $1.2 billion, which was the highest for any single quarter, as net revenues advanced by +17% to $4.9 billion.

""Our portfolio of businesses is now well positioned to serve clients and deliver growth globally.""  Merrill Lynch seems to be charging into the new year, so investors had better take notice.   
"
2333,MS,"On a side note, earlier in January, Merrill Lynch agreed to purchase the U.S. equities and options execution and clearing unit of ABN AMRO, which should close in the second quarter.  According to the company, the transaction will accelerate Merrill Lynch's efforts to build its options clearing business, expand Merrill Lynch's institutional client base, and enhance the service it provides to clients in these key businesses.

For the full year, the company posted a +33% jump in income from continuing operations to $17.85 billion, while earnings per share from continuing operations improved +32% to $3.42.  Revenues for the fourth quarter and full year improved by +13% and +9% respectively.  Citigroup surpassed $100 billion in equity capital and trust preferred securities for the first time in its history, while increasing its common dividend 94% during the year.  The company is moving confidently into 2004.  Citigroup stated that it invested in each of its global businesses throughout the year and thereby strengthened its competitive positions.

Mid December saw Morgan Stanley report diluted earnings per share of 94 cents for its fourth quarter, which was 5 cents, or almost +6%, better than the consensus and ahead of the year-ago performance.  Net revenue increased by +20% to $5.1 billion year-over-year.  However, both of those totals were below sequential levels.  For the fiscal year, Morgan Stanley reported diluted earnings of $3.47 per share, marking a +29% advance from $2.69 last year.  Net revenues for the year improved +9% to $20.9 billion.

The company maintains leadership positions in equity and fixed income sales, trading and research, investment banking, private equity, and private client services.  Last month, Lehman Brother reported fiscal fourth quarter net income of $481 million, or $1.71 per common share, which easily surpassed the year-ago total and also beat the consensus by more than +7%.  Net revenues rose +49% to $2.3 billion.  There was also good news for the full year fiscal 2003, where net income of $6.35 per share advanced by +74% from $3.47 in fiscal 2002.  Net revenues moved forward by +40% to $8.6 billion.  ""Our results for the quarter and for the full year reflect the firm's terrific momentum across all of our businesses,"" said Richard S. Fuld, Jr., Chairman and CEO.  ""A broadened client base and increased activity with our existing clients have driven steady increases in market share in both our investment banking and capital markets businesses.""

The company said the addition will provide its clients with access to a broader array of investment products and services.  To further research Lehman Brothers, click  LEH . 
"
2335,MS,"The stock market's robust rise over the past several months has helped many industries make up some ground, but perhaps no more so than for investment brokerages.  Except for fixed income and mortgages businesses, these companies had a very hard time operating in a difficult market that was shedding investors at a rapid pace.  But much like the prodigal son, these investors are slowly but surely creeping back into the marketplace as anticipation of a sustainable recovery becomes more tangible.  Currently, the investment brokerages industry has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.37, or 11th out of more than 200 industries, according to Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings and Sector Update.""   The pieces seem to be in place for this industry to make some strides coming up, which goes for investors as well if they make the right moves. 
"
2336,MS,"""I think the industry is clearly turning around,"" said Richard Bove, managing director at Hoefer & Arnett, ""and coming at a time with an extraordinarily low cost base.""  That low cost base came primarily because these businesses had cut employees to help cope with the challenging market.  When you combine the renewed interest in the stock market with this low cost base, a spike upward in earnings estimates isn't too far behind.   
"
2337,MS,"That improved stock market cannot be understated.  Bove has been seeing some encouraging trends coming out of businesses that had previously been stunted from the environment, including investment management and retail brokerage.  Both of these businesses tend to feed off of a thriving stock market, as investors become more willing to let their money leave the bank.  Furthermore, there is also evidence that merger & acquisitions are beginning to pick up some steam.   
"
2338,MS,"However, in spite of the market's meteoric rise, there remains plenty of apprehension surrounding the industry.  Because the fixed income and mortgages segments held up rather well during the downturn, many believe that these spaces are now set up for a collapse as conditions improve.  But Bove disagrees.  He does expect a decline in those two fields, but nothing like a collapse.  Instead the fixed income and mortgages spaces should experience a more moderate, gradual decline.  In fact, that gradual decline is one of two aspects that Bove believes investors should take into consideration before entering the industry.  The other aspect is an increase in investment banking.

Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:  GS ) is a global investment banking and securities firm, providing a full range of investing, advisory and financing services worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base, which includes corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high net worth individuals.  For its fiscal third quarter, Goldman Sachs reported earnings of $1.32 per diluted share.  That result was 32 cents better than the year-ago performance and also beat the consensus by more than +7%.  Like several other companies in its industry, Goldman Sachs got a boost from improving equity markets, especially when considering its principal investments and equity-sensitive businesses.  Asset Management reached record quarterly net revenues of $481 million, which marked a +20% increase over last year, reflecting higher assets under management, the contribution from its July acquisition of Ayco, an increased incentive income.  Furthermore, revenues for its Investment Banking and its Trading and Principal Investments segments also rose in the quarter.  Henry M. Paulson, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, stated, ""Once again we saw the importance of the firm's diverse business mix, as our performance in Asset Management, Equities and Securities Services, which benefited from improved equity markets, helped to offset sluggish investment baking volumes and more challenging conditions within Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities.""  Goldman Sachs seems to perfectly capture the renewed possibilities that brokerage houses now enjoy in a rising market, which is one of the main reasons why 5 All Star analysts currently recommend the company.
