10,HII,"Friday proved to be an unusual session as growth-style stocks and income-type utilities rallied nearly in lockstep amid a broad late-afternoon advance in the stock market today.XMeanwhile, members of the aerospace and defense industry group continue to have a hot start in 2018. IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry group has vaulted 6.7% year to date, vs. a less than 2% gain for the S&P 500, amid news reported by IBD that the Air Force is rushing to build a next-generation fighter jet.Lockheed Martin (LMT), which found nice support at the rising 50-day moving average during the fast slide in stocks in early February, gained 0.5% to 357.34. That extends the military jet and warfare systems giant's advance from a breakout past an eight-week flat base at 322.29 to nearly 11%.Lockheed pays a quarterly cash dividend of $2 per share, giving the stock an annualized yield of 2.3%. That's better than the 1.7% yield for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, at least 10 additional companies in the same industry group hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, including Teledyne Tech (TDY), Heico (HEI), Curtiss-Wright (CW), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit Aerosystems (SPR), Huntington Ingalls (HII), General Dynamics (GD) and KLX (KLXI).You can compare all of the IBD Ratings of each of these stocks with peers in the same industry group by using Stock Checkup to speed your fundamental analysis. Focus on those with rising relative strength lines, which are painted in blue in all IBD charts. A fast-rising RS line means a stock is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.At 3 p.m. ET, the Dow utility average shot more than 2.2% higher, beating gains of 1.3% to 1.5% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% as 12 of the 30 components rallied 1 point or more.The Dow utilities group is a big laggard so far in 2018, falling as much as 17% below its December peak of 778. Yet these dividend-rich defensive plays are getting relief from reports that members of the Federal Reserve's FOMC policy board are hinting at a continued ""go slow"" approach toward raising the cost of money.While a quarter-point hike in the short-term fed funds rate is likely in the bag during next month's meeting on interest rates, futures traders still see less than a 40% chance that, by year's end, the Fed would raise the fed funds rate by more than three times. The current target range is 1.25%-1.5%, and the majority of futures traders tracked by CME Group see the range rising to 2%-2.25%.That rate would still be much lower than the expected 12-month forward earnings yield of the S&P 500, which is around 5% to 5.5%, depending on which Wall Street investment strategist you trust.Meanwhile, investors bought back long-term bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged down to 2.88%. Earlier in the week, the yield hit as high as 2.95%, creeping closer to the January 2014 peak of 3.04%, a key psychological level for institutional investors.Going back to the military supplier group, Huntington Ingalls recently broke out of a three-month flat base with a 253.54 buy point. The 5% buy zone goes up to 266.22.Notice on the submarine and Navy class destroyer builder's daily chart that Huntington's relative strength line has ascended into new high ground, a bullish sign.KLX is finding buying support at the 50-day moving average for the second time since its breakout from a cup-shaped base at 54.50 on Oct. 3.The first and second pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week line can offer a timely entry to establish a new position in a leading stock or to add a small amount of shares to a winning core position.Among the FAANG stocks, Google search engine operator Alphabet (GOOGL) looked poised to finish a second straight week up. The internet content titan is up just 0.5% to 1,115.40, but Friday's advance is the eighth in 10 sessions. The stock is also up more than 2.5% for the week.Like the Nasdaq itself, Alphabet has turned in an impressive rebound after tickling its 200-day moving average Feb. 9.See on a daily chart how the megacap tech ($775 billion in market value, which is share price times shares outstanding) bounced sharply off its intraday low on Feb. 9, then finished up big in whale-like volume. That's bullish.For now, Alphabet is in a new base, less than 7% below its all-time peak of 1,197. The recent correction of 17% from head to toe is too deep to be a potential flat base. The correction is also too narrow in time to serve as a cup or a cup with handle. So keep watching.Also keep an eye on Alphabet's proprietary ratings.The Relative Price Strength Rating is not great, but at 78 on IBD Stock Checkup it's decent for a mature large cap. The very best growth companies tend to show an RS Rating in the high 80s or more. However, Alphabet, for now, should be viewed as a potential new big cap leader.Alphabet's Composite Rating is grand at 98.Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied more than 6% to 17.82 following positive reports that South Korea in fact may allow certain types of transactions in digital currencies. However, as noted frequently in IBD's Stock Market Today columns, the closed end fund has a very long way to go before forming a legitimate new base and staging a potential new breakout point.Universal Display (OLED) got hammered again, falling 15% to 131 in massive volume. The expert in organic light-emitting diodes for TVs and smartphone displays reported stout earnings growth, up 69%, as revenue jumped 55% to $115.9 million.However, the former stock market leader had already triggered two key sell signals: 1) Universal slammed beneath its 50-day moving average in huge trade on Jan. 24-25; and 2) the stock triggered the golden rule of investing as it slid 8% below the most recent late-stage base buy point of 192.85.In other markets, the persistent rise in crude oil seems to confirm the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar as well as optimism over the global economy, not just OPEC's continued willingness to limit its production.WTI near-term futures rose 1.3% to $63.58 a barrel, marking a three-week high. The year-to-date high for WTI is $66.14, last seen in late January. WTI prices have not touched the $70 level since late November of 2014.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on financial markets and top stocks.)RELATED:Can GE Stay In The Dow Jones Industrials?Finding Excellent Growth Stocks: Who Are New Hot IPOs?How The Time The Stock Market: Does Every Follow-Through Work Out?What Is The Current Stock Market Direction?How To Build A Good Watch List: Check These Stocks And The Annotated Charts

11,HII,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense stocks fell Tuesday, as the sector continues a sell-off that began last week.XLockheed's shares also tumbled last week, after the F-35 maker failed to raise its cash flow guidance when it reported first-quarter results. That weighed on hopes for bigger dividends while the 10-year Treasury yield topped 3% for the first time since 2014, making dividend-paying stocks are less attractive relative to debt.On Tuesday the two-year yield rose as high as 2.52%, the highest since the month before Lehman Bros. went bankrupt before pulling back 2.50%. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield climbed to 2.96%.Defense stocks had been setting up bases and nearing buy range heading into earnings last week, but now those bases have been wiped out.Lockheed shares tumbled 3.9% to close at 308.46 on the stock market today, despite receiving a $1.4 billion contract late Monday from the Pentagon and international customers for F-35 sustainment.But Edward Jones reiterated its buy rating on Lockheed in a note late Tuesday, saying geopolitical tensions remain high while militaries still need to modernize.Defense stocks such as Lockheed have likely fallen recently because values were historically high, and earnings ""were not pristine enough for investors,"" Edward Jones added. Additionally, there could be a reaction to the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Northrop fell 4.6% to its lowest since January. While the defense contractor's Q1 results beat Wall Street estimates last week, it didn't raise its cash flow guidance and said it dropped out of the running for the Air Force's GPS 3 satellites contract.Surveillance equipment developer L-3 Technologies (LLL) sank 4.5% to the lowest since November, and shipbuilder Huntinton Ingalls (HII) lost 3.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

13,HII,"The Navy is pushing for a multiship order of aircraft carriers to help reduce costs, but a debate remains over the need for such large warships as adversaries develop sophisticated weapons that put them at greater risk.XNavy Secretary Richard Spencer told the Wall Street Journal that shipbuilders suggested buying two aircraft carriers at a time when he asked industry how the service could reduce costs.Huntington Ingalls (HII), which was spun off from Northrop Grumman (NOC) in 2011, is the only prime contractor for aircraft carriers.""If we can tighten up our government-supplied equipment and have a very efficient hull build, we are starting to get savings that are very meaningful,"" Spencer said, though he didn't say how much could be saved.But critics are increasingly questioning the need for carriers, now that adversaries have weapons that could reduce their effectiveness.For example, China's DF-21D and longer-range DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles have been dubbed ""carrier killers."" Russia's Oscar II-class submarines are designed to counter carriers.The emergence of such weapons comes amid spiraling costs for carriers, which can now cost up to $13 billion each and may have to operate farther away from battles, stretching the effective range of the aircraft they carry.But Spencer told the Journal that the Navy still views carriers as a key element and has the technology to protect them.Currently, Congress only approves the purchase of one carrier at a time, but the Pentagon is pushing for other bulk orders to save money.Top defense officials are seeking a 440-plane order of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in the hopes that such a ""block buy"" will save up to $2 billion.Shares of Huntington Ingalls were down 8 cents at 234.81 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares rose 0.4% to 316.89, still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 308.58 entry point last month. Northrop rose 0.2%, above buy range. General Dynamics (GD), which also makes Navy warships, advanced 0.7% and is still in buying territory.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The debate over the aircraft carrier's long-term effectiveness comes as President Trump wants to expand the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from 275 today.Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers. The money could be used to buy less-expensive, smaller ships.RELATED: President Trump, Republicans Still Face Defense Spending ShowdownDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

16,HII,"The Pentagon is drafting its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 — the first that will fully show the Trump administration's vision for military spending — and events in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. Navy may weigh on the White House's priorities for defense dollars.""The 2017 and 2018 budgets were mostly about just trying to recover some readiness, they didn't look at sustainment and new investment and capabilities,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.President Trump is reportedly going to announce the deployment of 4,000 more troops as part of his long-awaited plan for Afghanistan when he address the nation tonight at 9 p.m. ET.Hunter said that isn't a major increase, so defense contractors in Afghanistan are unlikely to see a big spike in business. But the troop buildup also means Trump won't withdraw U.S. troops and produce a huge negative for companies.""If Trump had decided to scale back U.S. commitment and withdrawal, those engaged with Afghan security forces couldn't stay there,"" Hunter told IBD.Makers of ground vehicles, like General Dynamics (GD), could get a boost — as well as the companies that help maintain vehicles for the Afghan military.Sales of the low-cost A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions, could also get a boost, Hunter added.The plane's performance in Afghanistan could have implications for the U.S. arsenal too. The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 low-cost attack aircraft by 2022, to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The Super Tucano, made jointly by privately held Sierra Nevada and Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), is participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment with light-attack aircraft, along with the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).U.S. and South Korea forces will conduct previously scheduled joint military exercises this week despite pressure from North Korea and China to cancel the event.The war games could prompt North Korea to ratchet up pressure again, after pulling back from its threats to launch missiles toward Guam.Hunter said missile defense spending would have to increase to meet the short-term demands of more intercepts in addition to longer-term R&D, noting that the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo last week that put missile defense at the top of its R&D priorities list.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is currently deployed outside Seoul, and Boeing (BA) is the prime on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system used to protect the U.S.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works Late Sunday, the USS John S.

22,HII,"The Trump administration on Monday tossed out the first pitch of the president's first budget campaign, proposing $54 billion in new defense spending and a corresponding trim to the federal discretionary budget, which funds agencies including the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The push begins with what Bloomberg reported as a $30 billion budget amendment from the Pentagon.…
"
23,HII,"President Trump's budget request calls for a $54 billion increase in defense spending and will give the Defense Department latitude on where the extra money goes, according to a Reuters report, after earlier worries that the White House budget chief would be stingy with the Pentagon.OMB Director Mick Mulvaney was a fiscal hawk and sequester backer when he was in the House of Representatives, and the White House's budget proposal seeks offsetting budget cuts equal to the Defense Department boost in other areas of discretionary spending.But the proposal has more money allotted for ships and military aircraft to have ""a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints,"" an official told Reuters.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares rose 1.3% to 269.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 270 buy point from a cup base. Northrop Grumman (NOC) advanced 1.45% to 248.60, on its way to a 253.90 entry. Raytheon (RTN) picked up 0.9% to 154.82, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing (BA) climbed 1.1%.General Dynamics (GD) advanced 0.4% and Huntington Ingalls (HII) 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Even if Trump ramps up defense spending analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.The increases in defense spending will be funded by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-military agencies, according to the Reuters report, but won't include cuts from Social Security or Medicare, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday.Additional specifics weren't available, though Trump could reveal some Tuesday night during his address to a joint session of Congress.During his campaign, he promised to increase the Navy's fleet by 78 ships to at least 350, and add at least 100 combat fighters to the Air Force. He also vowed to boost the Army's ranks by 60,000 and the Marine Corps' by 12,000.But it remains to be seen how the White House plans to balance increases in weapons procurement, which would send more money to the big defense contractors, with increases in personnel spending, which requires putting money in housing, chow halls, uniforms and medical care.The additional dollar on warplanes would come after Trump blasted high military aircraft costs and vowed to get a better deal on Lockheed's F-35 and suggested buying updated Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.RELATED:Trump: ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet OrderInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'

24,HII,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) pointed out Friday that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create 1,800 jobs in Texas and thousands more across U.S. suppliers, as production on the stealth fighter hits full speed in the next few years.Earlier, CEO Marillyn Hewson met with President-elect Donald Trump, following his latest complaints about the $400 billion F-35 program's costs.After the meeting, Lockheed said it is near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the cost, echoing comments from the Pentagon's program office last month that the cost would likely come down ""6%-7%."" for the tenth batch of fighters.In December, Hewson met with Trump at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after Trump tweeted that the F-35's costs were ""out of control"" and said he asked Boeing (BA) to price out a comparable F/A-18 Super Hornet.Trump on Wednesday called out the F-35 program again, saying ""we're going to have some competition, and it's going to be a beautiful thing.""Lockheed shares climbed 0.8% to 254.57 on the stock market today but are below their 50-day moving average after falling for the prior four sessions.

James Mattis, Trump's defense secretary nominee, backed the F-35 program, saying the fighter ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane.""Mattis also empathized that Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Other defense CEOs could be making a trip to see Trump as Huntington Ingalls Industries' (HII) aircraft carriers, General Dynamics' (GD) and Lockheed's littoral combat ships, and Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 could be the next big defense programs under fire from the president-elect.Trump ""is clearly not shy about expressing his opinions, and it's having a major effect on the defense industry,"" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told IBD Wednesday.Huntington Ingalls rose 0.3%. Northrop edged up 0.45%. General Dynamics climbed 0.8%.Trump has also blasted drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) for ""getting away with murder.""He also took aim at General Motors (GM) last week for ""sending Mexican made models of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border.""GM fought back, saying that all Cruze sedans were built in the U.S. and only a ""small number"" of Cruze hatchbacks built in Mexico are sold in the U.S.RELATED: On Pentagon Spending, Will Trump Put Your Money Where His Mouth Is?Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

25,HII,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet, which President-elect Donald Trump has suggested may compete against the more advanced stealth jet.In a ""Defense One"" sponsored event Tuesday, Richardson said the Super Hornet, which is considered a 4th-generation fighter, could be upgraded to a 4.5-generation fighter and noted that the Navy's carrier air wing will consist of 5th- and 4th-generation fighters ""in the foreseeable future.""""We need the F-35s,"" he said. ""That is our 5th-gen capability which we need, supplemented by healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets.""Addressing Trump's complaints about the F-35's costs and his vow to lower them, Richardson added, ""We need that capability, and we need to get it at the very best price for the taxpayer.""Shares of Lockheed were down 0.2% to 254.12 at the close on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, was off 0.7% to 228.48, and United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engines, slipped 0.2% to 109.97. Boeing dipped 0.7% to 157.67.Amid expectations for a bigger shipbuilding budget, Richardson said the Navy would prioritize resources on ships that are being built now, such as destroyers, attack submarines and amphibious warfare ships.""The industrial base is ready to respond"" to the call for more ships, Richardson said.Shares of shipbuilder General Dynamics (GD) lost 1.1% to close at 175.97 while rival Huntington Ingalls (HII) fell 1% to 189.61.RELATED: Lockheed Notes F-35 Jobs From Production Hike As Trump Blasts CostsAir Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

26,HII,"First, President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program, then he targeted Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and suggested that the Pentagon might buy more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.So what Pentagon program could be next to get the Trump treatment?Trump has said he would build up the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from its current 272, but the ramp-up would come at a high cost.Lockheed could be in Trump's crosshairs again. It is building the littoral combat ship, while a separate team made up of Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) is building a different version of the LCS. The ships are designed to operate in coastal — or littoral — waters.The program is already coming under scrutiny, and earlier this month Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasted the Navy for spending $12.4 billion on 26 ships. The cost per ship has nearly doubled to $478 million, and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Trump must decide if the Navy will purchase 12 more of the ships for a total cost of $14 billion.Lockheed shares fell 0.5% at 249.56 on the stock market today. General Dynamics dipped 0.9%.Huntington Ingalls (HII) is currently building the USS John F. Kennedy, a second Ford-class aircraft carrier, with a projected cost of $11.35 billion.Among a list of options, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this month that the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers after the current ship is completedCanceling just one carrier would free up funds to buy less-expensive, smaller ships to achieve Trump's goal of boosting the size of the fleet.Huntington Ingalls shares were off 0.7%.Trump wants to build up America's nuclear arsenal, but that won't come cheaply either.The cost of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, is a big question mark as the Air Force has declined to give specific figures, saying U.S. adversaries would be able to infer its capabilities.McCain has been critical of that approach, arguing that taxpayers deserve to know how much they are spending on the plane.The Air Force has put the development cost for the long range strike bomber at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts estimate the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Northrop shares edged 0.6% lower to 231.92.America's nuclear missiles are nearing the end of their life spans and need to be replaced.Over the summer, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's Minuteman system.The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" according to a Bloomberg report.The Air Force also needs Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace its Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. The program will likely come at a cost of $20 billion to $30 billion.RELATED: Here's Where Lockheed Could Lose F-35 Orders To Boeing F/A-18sAfter Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'

"
28,HII,"Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets, but analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.During his campaign, Trump said he would eliminate the ""sequester"" budget constraints on the Pentagon and increase spending. But after the election, Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk and sequester backer, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.""I'm very tempered in the kind of new money I would expect to see in any so-called buildup,"" and the defense industry should ""restrain expectations,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.And despite Trump's aggressive campaign talk on defense, he has signaled reluctance to pay up, blasting the costs of Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. After his Twitter (TWTR) rants, top defense stocks gave up their postelection gains and haven't recovered.Wall Street expects Q4 numbers to show that growth at Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon picked up in 2016, but it sees a slowdown in 2017, though that could change when the White House's plans become clearer.Analysts and investors will get their first look at Trump's spending priorities when he submits a defense supplemental budget request within his first 100 days. In the spring, the fiscal 2018 budget proposal comes out. And later in the year, the administration will lay out the Pentagon's next five-year plan.Trump has said he wants to grow the Army by 60,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps by 12,000 Marines as well as boost the Navy's fleet by 78 to 350 ships and add at least 100 combat aircraft at the Air Force.More troops mean the Pentagon will spend more on pay, health care, chow halls and housing. Those costs could crowd out demand for big-budget ground weapons, like a new armored vehicle to replace the Army's Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks, meaning limited upside for defense contractors hoping for lucrative deals.But targeting a certain fleet size means more Navy ships have to be ordered.Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees Trump adding more next-generation attack submarines, noting that the Virginia-class sub is already in serial production and should avoid Trump's ire.""They don't have the same problems that have been the subject of those tweets,"" Cancian told IBD. ""Those were programs that have had or have the prospects of significant cost increases.""But new Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines could come under fire eventually, as their overall costs become more apparent, he added.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII) are building the Virginia-class subs, while GD is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class ""boomers,"" which are in the design phase.IBD'S TAKE: The defense industry isn't the only one falling prey to Trump's tweet storms. Trump attacked General Motors for sending Mexican-made cars to U.S. dealers and threatened to levy big import taxes on cars built outside the U.S.Trump has also been a proponent of strengthening America's nuclear arsenal, tweeting last month that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability"" and called for an arms race as Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly looks for missiles that can evade countermeasures.So the ballistic-missile subs, along with Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider, could be safe from attack, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.Meanwhile, the Air Force's request for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system as well as Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles will also likely be funded.""Those are probably the two programs that are on the edge, and my guess is that (Trump) would buy both of those, whereas a Democratic administration might not have,"" Cancian said.The estimated cost of the ICBM program is $62 billion over 30 years, but reports say the Air Force's estimate is billions of dollars short. The LRSO plan's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two programs, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded this year.Another Air Force priority is the F-35, and Trump's pledge to give the Air Force 100 more combat aircraft could help the program, despite his suggestion that Lockheed's orders may be reduced in favor of more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets.The Air Force is getting more than 70% of the Pentagon's total procurement of 2,443 F-35s, and it doesn't currently fly the Super Hornet, making it an unlikely addition to the service's fleet.The F-35 is also in production, and costs are already falling as output increases. IHS Markit's Bobbi said Trump will still likely fund the F-35 program after getting further price reductions.And flying under the radar is the Air Force's $16 billion T-X program for 350 trainer aircraft, which Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are seeking. Bobbi said Trump ""has bigger fish to fry.""Israel is also buying the F-35 and recently increased its order amid a wider rebound in international defense spending as regional tensions in the Middle East, Asia and Europe intensify.Despite funding pressure from lower oil prices, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states will invest in more weapons systems as Iran is expected to update its arsenal. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain already have F-15s and Super Hornets on order from Lockheed and Boeing.Cancian sees Japan and South Korea buying more missile defense systems from the U.S. as China adds military hardware to its man-made islands in the South China Seas and North Korea tests more nuclear warheads and missiles. South Korea plans to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system later this year, and Japan is considering it as well.IHS Jane's expects defense investment in the Baltic states to double over the next two years and Western European spending to ""strengthen over the next decade"" on Trump's threats to pull out of NATO unless other members contributed more.""Defense spending returned to a healthy rate of growth in 2016, kicking off what we expect to be a decade of stronger global defense spending,"" said Fenella McGerty, principal analyst at IHS Jane's, in a release. ""Defense spending should recover to pre-financial-crisis levels by 2018.""RELATED: Battle Stations!

29,HII,"President-elect Donald Trump appeared to challenge Russia to a nuclear arms race Friday after tweeting Thursday that the U.S. must strengthen its nuclear arsenal.During a phone interview with MSNBC, he said, ""Let it be an arms race.

35,HII,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Despite oil near $30 a barrel, the Navy is focused on cutting back fuel consumption to give itself a ""tactical and strategic edge"" and is on track to have more than 300 ships in service by the end of the decade, according to a top official.At the Surface Navy Association's National Symposium on Thursday, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said the Navy is on track to boost its fleet to over 300 ships by the end of the decade but still doesn't like comparisons between the fleet now vs. World War I, as technology and the need for ships are changing.""Yes we have fewer ships than we had in World War I, but we also have fewer telegraphs,"" Mabus said.Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) is the nation's largest military shipbuilder. Huntington Ingalls shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, after jumping over its 50-day line on Wednesday. The Coast Guard plans to acquire two new icebreakers from the defense contractor.Mabus also touted the use of solar and hybrid power in the armed forces and said that, since 2009, the Navy has reduced oil consumption by 15%, and the Marine Corps has cut oil consumption by 60%.""We have become way more efficient in the way we use it,"" he said. ""We don't have to refuel as much, which gives us a tactical and strategic edge.""Last week, Duke Energy (DUK) said it would build a 24-megawatt solar project for the Navy in Indiana. SunPower (SPWR) has already built a solar power system for the Navy in California.Duke shares rose 0.9%. SunPower shares closed up 0.4%.Meanwhile at sea, ships are using blends of marine diesel and bio-fuels to cut back on crude oil consumption. The Navy started a program for using drop-in biofuels in aircraft and ships in 2012, including hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquids, and it has awarded contracts with Emerald Biofuels, Fulcrum BioEnergy and Red Rock Biofuels to build biorefineries to produce greener fuel.Some commercial airlines are also proponents of alternative fuel sources. Last year, United Continental (UAL) invested in U.S.-based alternative fuels developer Fulcrum.Mabus said the Navy has contracts overseas with companies who get their source of oil from places that aren't in America's best interest. Instead, Mabus is focused on getting contracts for biofuels with companies in friendly countries and in the U.S.Iran, a major oil producer that will come back onto the world market as sanctions are expected to lift soon, seized two American patrol boats in the Persian Gulf earlier this week. The sailors were released, and Mabus said Thursday that the crew appeared to be in ""pretty good shape"" and that more will be known after the sailors are debriefed.Despite somewhat warmer relations between the U.S. and Iran, Tehran is still at odds with U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Biofuels and alternative energy are still expensive, especially with oil near $30 a barrel. Still, later this month the Navy will launch the Great Green Fleet in San Diego to highlight the importance of alternative energy and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.

67,HII,"The Pentagon is pushing for more power to block defense mergers and preserve competition, but analysts say any consolidation triggered by the recent contract award for a new long-range bomber might not be a bad thing after all.
"
68,HII,"Right now, the Defense Department can review one merger at a time but says this case-by-case process doesn't give it the big picture on who controls market share. So the Pentagon is asking Congress for a bigger voice over industry deal-making.
"
69,HII,"Defense Secretary Ash Carter and the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, warned against further industry consolidation after Lockheed Martin (LMT) got the OK from the Justice Department for its $9 billion purchase of helicopter maker Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX).

71,HII,"GD-Huntington Ingalls Duel
"
72,HII,"But Russell Solomon, a senior vice president at Moody's, thinks a smaller industrial base would have some advantages, saying a defense sector that stays fragmented in order to keep more companies in business actually creates inefficiencies and pushes costs higher.
"
73,HII,"""We think it would be in everyone's best interest to have consolidation at the highest level,"" he said.
"
74,HII,"And going down to two major aircraft contractors from three wouldn't hurt competition, Solomon added, citing the competitive bidding for shipbuilding contracts between the two main contractors, General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII).
"
75,HII,"But Solomon said talk of mergers at the highest levels is considered ""blasphemy"" right now, so most mergers in the near future will come from the tier-two or tier-three supply chain levels. He cited earlier deals like Aerojet's 2013 acquisition of Rocketdyne and ATK's combination with Orbital Sciences this year.

81,HII,"Boeing shares are down 3.3% since the contract was awarded. Northrop shares are down 1.8%, and Lockheed's are down 2%.
"
82,HII,"Prior to the award of the bomber contract, Boeing indicated that it would maintain the status quo afterward. In its quarterly conference call in October, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the aerospace giant's defense business ""overall is a healthy portfolio"" and that he ""likes the program structures we have.""

83,HII,"Upcoming Drone Award
"
84,HII,"Another program, the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike drone, is up for grabs and could provide a boost to the defense business. The Navy awarded four preliminary design contracts last year to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop, which will compete for a final award later.
"
85,HII,"But that may not go Boeing's way either. While it has made innovations in its commercial aerospace segment, innovation on the defense side has been stagnant, with Boeing and other manufacturers ""coasting on derivatives for so long,"" Aboulafia said.
"
86,HII,"Delays and budget issues could also put that program in jeopardy, even though it is strategically important, according to Solomon.
"
87,HII,"As the Pentagon weighs the prospect of having only two main aircraft contractors, the recent history of the space-launch market may offer a sign of what's to come.
"
88,HII,"Boeing and Lockheed once competed to provide launch services for military payloads. But 10 years ago, they merged their launch operations into a joint venture called United Launch Alliance (ULA), which had a virtual monopoly on Pentagon business.

The overbudget and problem-dogged carrier is now is back at sea and set for initial combat duty in 2022.January's failure was the second in under a year with a ""main thrust bearing"" portion of the carrier's propulsion system. The first, in April 2017, happened during trials at sea a month before delivery.After the January incident, an inspection revealed that ""machining errors"" by GE workers was the ""root cause"" of the problem, Navy officials said. Huntington has notified ""the original manufacturer"" that it intends to seek compensation, the Navy added. Huntington itself said it continues ""to work with appropriate stakeholders to support resolution of this situation.""Meanwhile, Boston-based GE declined to comment on specifics beyond saying it is ""working closely"" with Huntington and the Navy to resolve the issue.Shares of GE fell 1.9% to 12.95 on the stock market today as fears that President Donald Trump will escalate a trade war with China spurred a broad market retreat.

115,HII,"Boeing's (BA) booming commercial aircraft business will help keep its stock strong while the overall defense sector's six consecutive years of outperformance have come to an end, according to Credit Suisse.XThe U.S. aerospace giant and Dow Jones Industrial Average component remains a top pick by analyst Robert Spingarn, who also downgraded or cut price targets on more pure-play defense stocks such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD), Harris (HRS), Huntington Ingalls (HII) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were given downgrades or price target reductions.He noted that current defense-hardware stock valuations resemble levels reached in 2001 and warned that a big midterm win for Democrats could cause the stocks to crumble.""Whereas in 2001 those multiples were deserved in light of the beginning of a major land war and the end of an industry consolidation wave, today's market appears to have gotten ahead of itself,"" Spingarn said in a research note.""True, the 2018 budget was excellent and the 2019 budget looks favorable, but growth over 2018 is merely at inflation levels, and a possible blue wave in the midterms threatens a showdown in 2020 with the return of sequester looming as a tail risk.""Boeing, which broke out last week, fell 2.45% to 355.02 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Lockheed Martin fell 2.2%, Raytheon lost 2.9%, General Dynamics dipped 0.7%, Harris dropped 2.4%, Huntington Ingalls eased 0.9% and Northrop Grumman sold off 2.1%.Spingarn said valuations are too high when current budget documents and political realities are taken into account.But despite the seemingly limited upside for hardware stocks, there are still some big winners.""Overall, we remain more bullish on Commercial Aerospace, where Boeing and Bombardier remain our two top picks across the sector,"" Spingarn said.Ironically, given their trade spat earlier this year, Bombardier was named the top pick ahead of Boeing. The next two top picks were General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, which have shipbuilding operations that should benefit from the Pentagon's focus on near-peer global rivals.However, the news was not as sunny for advanced weapons manufacturer Raytheon, as it was given a downgrade from outperform to neutral. General Dynamics, Harris, Huntington Ingalls and L3 Technologies remained rated as outperform, however all were given price target reductions.BWX Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman retained their neutral rating, however they were also all given target price cuts.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: Lockheed Martin's F-35 Stealth Fighter Makes Combat Debut In Israeli Operation Boeing Stock Breaks Out; These 4 Aerospace & Defense Stocks Are Near Buy Zones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

118,HII,"Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and General Dynamics (GD) are showing signs of strength in an overall weak market as Pentagon spending ramps up and foreign demand for U.S. weapons remains high.The stock market rally is under pressure, with the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones falling toward their 200-day moving averages. So now is not the time for buying new stocks, but defense contractors are worth a look for your watch list.

119,HII,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other top Pentagon contractors will benefit from a huge bump in military spending under the $1.3 trillion fiscal 2018 budget that President Trump signed Friday, just hours after threatening to veto it.Lawmakers have earmarked $654.6 billion for the Pentagon, an increase of $61.1 billion from the 2017 budget, as global tensions increase in North Korea, Russia, China and the Middle East.The House passed the legislation late Wednesday, and the Senate passed it in the early morning hours on Friday. But Trump tweeted later today that the budget didn't fully fund a border wall and lacked a resolution for the DACA program, which he moved to end last year. He signed it anyway, citing national security priorities.Missile defense will get $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion from the fiscal 2017 budget and more than the $9.5 billion the Missile Defense Agency requested.

Boeing has booked $2.9 billion before taxes, or $1.9 billion after taxes, in charges for cost overruns associated with the tanker, which is based on a 767 airframe.The Army will get $577 million for 17 Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopters, and the Navy will get $501 million for three more Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft.Boeing shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today, paring intraday gains sharply after sinking 5.2% Thursday as concerns about a trade war with China hurt prospects for the company's commercial aircraft business.Congress approved $2.9 billion for 20 more F-35s, bringing the total for this fiscal year to 90 planes.The Navy will get eight more of the carrier variant of the fifth-generation jet and the Marines will get four more short take off/vertical landing F-35s as well as two carrier versions.

121,HII,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a modification contract for providing Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measures (LAIRCM) equipment and support. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $209.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Per the terms, this modification will take the total cumulative face value of the deal to $1.6 billion.A minor portion of the agreement includes foreign military sales LAIRCM acquisitions to South Korea. Notably, the funds for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 aircraft procurement, National Guard, Navy as well as operations and maintenance will be utilized to finance the task. The project will be executed in Rolling Meadows, IL.What’s LAIRCM?The LAIRCM system is essential and critical for the safety of onboard troops in a hostile situation. It is an active countermeasure that can automatically detect a missile launch. On identifying a missile, LAIRCM determines if it is a threat and activates a high-intensity, laser-based countermeasure system to track and destroy the missile on its own, with no action required by the crew. The primary purpose of the LAIRCM program is to protect large aircraft from man-portable missiles.Why Northrop Grumman?Of late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour and a well-equipped, developed nation like the U.S. will always want to be well prepared for any sudden assault.Moreover, throughout 2017, repeated missile threats from North Korea have forced the United States to ramp up its focus toward its missile defense space. Undoubtedly, this has led the Trump administration to multiply its arsenal treasury, both in terms of attacking missiles as well as accumulating protective measures like LAIRCM.Currently, Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system is the only DIRCM system in production that can protect an aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. LAIRCM is one variant of such a DIRCM.Considering the present situation in the nation and Northrop’s combat-proven LAIRCM, more contracts like the latest one can be expected to boost the company’s sales.Meanwhile, on Feb 12, 2018, the Pentagon unveiled the fiscal 2019 budget proposal. This financial plan provisions spending of $716 billion on national security, including funds of  $686.1 billion for the Pentagon. It includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the current continuing resolution level. Being one of the largest aerospace-defense players in 2017, we expect Northrop Grumman to benefit from the budget reflecting increased spending provision for the country’s defense.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 44.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47.3%. The underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few better or similar-ranked stocks in the same space are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

122,HII,"Following a chemical attack in Douma near the Syrian capital Damascus which claimed around 60 lives, the Trump administration is weighing its military options against Syria. In case the United States decides to launch military actions against Syria it is likely to receive support from France’s president Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s prime minister Theresa May.Several other countries are willing to support the United States in its move against the Syrian government of President Assad. The Trump government’s likely air strikes will not be limited to Syria but will also be aimed at its major supporters, Russia and Iran. In this context, Russia has already warned the United States of retaliatory actions. With both United States and Russia likely to conduct military actions against each other related to Syria, defense stocks seem to be a lucrative investment choice.What Happened In Douma?On Apr 7, Douma, a rebel-held western Syrian city near Damascus witnessed a serious attack when chemical bombs were dropped on the region. Following the attack, around 60 people including women and children lost their lives, while more than 1,000 were injured. President Trump slammed this attack calling its “heinous” and “atrocious” and said that the United States has “a lot of options militarily” to answer to this.Last April, Syria’s Shayrat airbase, which acted as a launch pad for a poisonous gas attack on the city of Khan Sheikoun, was attacked and neutralized by the United States. The Trump administration along with its ally countries are now thinking of conducting a similar or even higher scale of attack on Al Dumayr air base, which acted as the launching point for Apr 7’s supposed chemical assault on Douma.Trump Condemns Douma Chemical AttackOn Apr 12, the President Trump warned Russia, a key supporter of Syria’s Assad government to “get ready” for the chemical attack on the city of Douma. Meanwhile, both Syria and Russia responded to Trump’s tweet, Syria's Foreign Ministry issued a statement, calling this a “reckless escalation.” Maria Zakharova, spokesperson of Russia’s Foreign Ministry said smart missiles should be directed toward terrorists and not a “legal government,” which has carried out its fight against “international terrorism for several years on its territory.”Earlier, Trump called Syria’s move an attack on humanity and said that Syria supported by Iran’s ground forces and Russia’s air transportation will “pay a price.” In fact, President Trump canceled his first visit to South America and instead chose to carefully watch “the American response to Syria,"" per a White House statement.Russia in No Mood to Sit BackAdditionally, on Apr 11, in a UN Security Council meeting, Russia clearly said that in case the United States conducts any missile strike on Russia or even Syria, it will answer back with similar moves. Vladimir Putin-led country will answer United States’ action with similar moves. In the meeting, Vasily Nebenzia, the representative of Vladimir Putin-led Russia to the United Nations, requested the United States to “refrain from the plans” being developing at present. He warned that if the United States carries out any ""illegal military adventure,"" it will have to ""bear responsibility"" for that.Separately, Alexander Zasypkin, Russia’s ambassador to Lebanon reportedly said that if the United States conducts any air strike, “the missiles will be downed” and “the sources from which the missiles were fired"" will also be eliminated. In this fight between two permanent members of the UN, the United States and Russia, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will position a team “shortly” in Syria to evaluate whether banned chemical weapons were used in the Douma attack.5 Best Defense StocksBoth the United States and Russia have given clear signals of military actions against one another, which have brought the spotlight back on companies that are involved in the defense industry. In this context, we can say that Syria’s attack on Douma city has clearly shifted focus on companies involved in the manufacture and processing of defense equipment.We have selected five stocks that are expected to gain following these developments.

123,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently announced the program deliveries across its commercial and defense operations for the first quarter of 2018. The figures show an 8.9% rise in commercial shipments and 40.5% decline in defense shipments from the previous year.Q1 Orders & DeliveriesBoeing reported first-quarter 2018 commercial deliveries of 184 airplanes, up year over year primarily backed by higher demand for 737 jets. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 132 in the first quarter of 2018 from 113 a year ago.Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners totaled 12 and 34, compared with 21 and 32 in the year-ago period, respectively. For the 747 and 767 jets, the company delivered 2 and 4 jets, respectively compared with 1 and 2 in the year-ago quarter.In its defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 25 in first-quarter 2018, down from 42 dispatched in the year-ago period. Total deliveries consisted of 6 AH-64 Apache helicopters (remanufactured) and 8 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). The company also delivered 4 P-8’s, 5 F/A-18s and 2 F-15s.Boeing’s total deliveries were 209 units in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 211 a year ago.What’s Favoring Boeing?Being the largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy of its varied product offerings.In particular, the company’s commercial and defense business has been gaining traction in recent days, in the form of huge inflow of jet orders from airlines worldwide. The company recently received an order worth $12 billion to deliver 47 787-9 Dreamliners to American Airlines. A week back it also received orders worth $8.8 billion for 75 737 MAX Airplanes from Jet Airways. In terms of its Defense business, Boeing recently secured a $1.2 billion deal to support Kuwait's F/A-18 Jets. Such frequent and large contract wins are surely expected to ramp up production and improve Boeing’s deliveries in the second quarter.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $21.7 billion for defense aircrafts. Boeing is expected to gain significantly from this budgetary provision, as it includes an investment plan of $8.5 billion for its varied defense programs.On the commercial front, Boeing estimates demand for 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion in the next two decades. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major demand driver, accounting for 72% of the total projection along with widebody jets, comprising over 20%. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion and 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.5 trillion. Such projections will aid Boeing in maintaining its position as one of the largest aerospace and defense contractor worldwide.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 87.5% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 45.7%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and for its military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ; Clearwater, FL and Owego, NY. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy); 2018 defense-wide procurement; 2017 other procurement (Navy); and 2012 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by August 2020.A Brief Note on RMS UnitLockheed Martin’s RMS segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters, ships and submarine missions and unmanned and combat systems. In addition, it also offers simulation and training services. Its customers include the U.S. Army and Navy, and various government agencies of the United States and other countries along with commercial customers.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Being Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Department of Defense. The company acquired a massive $3.5-billion deal last month to provide army training solutions.Lockheed Martin’s RMS segment recorded sales of $4.4 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, which reflected a year-over-year improvement of 14.2%. We believe, the aforementioned contract wins, along with the latest one, will allow this segment to deliver similar notable performance in the days ahead.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin is expected to gain significantly from this budgetary provision, as it includes an investment plan of $2.8 billion for varied missiles.The global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 time frame to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm), due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and terrorism. Such projections reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the years to come.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 24.8% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

125,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business segment, Newport News, recently secured a modification contract to purchase additional long lead time material for supporting the USS Enterprise (CVN 80). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by February 2027.Valued at $200.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund to finance the task, which will be executed in Newport News, VA.A Brief Note on USS EnterpriseThe USS Enterprise (CVN 80), Gerald R. Ford class’ third aircraft carrier, bears the name of the Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65).Once CVN 80 enters service, it will replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) — a Nimitz-class ship. Currently, advanced fabrication of CVN 80 is underway, for which the company expects to witness contracting activity by 2020 end.The air wing of this new USS Enterprise will be capable of supporting more than 75 aircraft of varied kinds, including fixed-wing and rotary-wing systems. Moreover, an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will be incorporated in the ship to replace the steam catapults of the older versions.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of its ships. Notably, this military shipbuilder’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines.Moreover, it is imperative to mention that Huntington Ingalls’ shipbuilding business outlook remains upbeat, considering the fiscal 2019 budget that has been approved recently by the U.S. Senate. Per the latest financial plan, major war fighting investments includes spending plans of $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding. Also, incremental funding for nuclear aircraft carriers — CVN-79 and CVN-80 — is a part of the fiscal 2019 budget.No doubt, one of the prime beneficiaries of this new spending proposal will be Huntington Ingalls. For more than 100 years, this company has been building ships, aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy at the shipyards in Virginia and Mississippi.  Considering such optimistic budget allocation, we may expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such contracts involving its combat-proven military warships in days ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Huntington Ingalls’ shares have gained about 16.5% compared with the industry’s 30.2% rally. The underperformance may have been caused by huge debt levels that the company bears, with the current market situation in the United States being in favor of increasing interest rates. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Huntington Ingalls currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

126,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract worth $50 million for original equipment manufacturing of (OEM) Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA fighter jet. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Aug 6, 2019.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron, Joint Base San Antonio Randolph, Texas. Per the terms, the latest modification offers a one-year extension to the existing contract’s performance period, thus taking the total cumulative face value of the deal to $305 million.Foreign military sales funds will be used to carry out the task in Khamis, Saudi Arabia.A Brief Note on F-15Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories. The F-15SA is a variant of F-15 that has been developed for the Royal Saudi Air Force.Notably, the F-15SA model provides improved performance and increased survivability at a lower life-cycle cost. The aircraft has two additional wing stations for increased payload and capability.Our ViewWith rising security threats across the globe, apart from developed nations like the United States, developing economies like Saudi Arabia are ramping up their arsenal. Considering the fact that the United States is the largest exporter of weaponries in the world and Boeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, the company has served as a loyal partner for Royal Saudi Air Force in defending its nation.Interestingly, over the years, Boeing has developed a genial relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (""KSA""). The company’s defense unit started doing business with the nation following Royal Saudi Air Force’s purchase of F-15C/D fleet in 1978. Notably, this remains the mainstay of KSA’s air defense till date.Since then, Boeing has been winning a number of contracts from the KSA for advanced military weaponries. Of the latest notable deals, in August 2017, the company won a $223-million contract for supplying eight CH-47F new helicopters to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command.Additionally, to further strengthen its ties with KSA, Boeing announced on Mar 30, 2018 that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Saudi Arabian Military Industries to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia. It goes without saying that the latest contract win will allow the company to expand its footprint in KSA, which has bountiful prospects.These developments is likely boost Boeing’s defense unit’s growth trajectory, which registered a 5% sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting a top line worth $5.5 billion.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has surged about 80.5% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43%. The outperformance was primarily backed by robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks   Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

127,HII,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract per which the company will procure new training systems as well as hardware and software upgrades for F/A-18C/D/E/F and EA-18G jets. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by April 2023.Valued at $218.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL. The latest deal will modify the existing aircrew training systems for these military aircraft. Further, this contract will support software configuration set upgrades, engineering change proposals, Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan upgrades and spare parts for hardware deliverables.Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy) and 2018 operation and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized to partly finance the task, which will be carried out in Arlington, TX.A Brief Note on F/A-18 & EA-18G JetsBoeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.The company’s EA-18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack platform which operates from either an aircraft carrier or from land bases. The aircraft helps combat electronic attack and suppresses enemy air defenses, particularly at the start and at early stages of on-going hostilities. The major contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) manufactures the rear and center fuselage sections of this jet.What’s Favoring L3 Technologies?Due to rising political uncertainties and terrorism worldwide, especially the growing crisis in the Middle East, the defense industry is gaining traction. Countries, throughout the world, are increasing their expenditure on various defense equipment, with aircraft being one of their top priorities.The United States is the largest spender in defense space. Apart from manufacturing high-end military jets, providing state-of-the-art training to pilots along with other software and hardware upgrades to aircraft form an integral part of the nation’s defense aircraft management.L3 Technologies’ Aerostructures business unit provides avionics hardware and software systems, while its Electronic Systems business segment offers aircraft simulation and training systems. In fact, realizing the expanding market for aircraft simulation and training market, L3 Technologies acquired Doss Aviation last September.Doss Aviation is the sole provider of initial flight training for U.S. Air Force pilots and offers curriculum coursework and flight training to both fixed-wing and unmanned aircraft pilots. Thus, by purchasing Doss Aviation, L3 Technologies significantly expanded its footprint in the military aircraft simulation and training market worth multi-billion-dollar.In February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts, which includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircraft. With F/A-18 and EA-18 aircraft being in high demand, procurement contracts for these jets from Pentagon will boost L3 Technologies’ profit margin, as the company will offer these jets’ necessary technological upgrades.With the budget including facilities investment of $10.5 billion, along with training solutions, we expect L3 Technologies to win more such contracts like the latest one in the coming days.Price PerformanceL3 Technologies stock has returned 25% over a year, underperforming the 28.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the weak performance that the company has been witnessing in some of its product lines. The downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure remains a concern.  Zacks Rank & Key PickL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

128,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for HII broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 2.8% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for HII stock.If that wasn’t enough, Huntington Ingalls Industries isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate has been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this into a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead.

130,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract to deliver 47 787-Dreamliner aircrafts to American Airlines, the world’s largest airline. Per the terms, the airline will recieve 22 787-8 and 25 787-9 Dreamliners from Boeing to expand and modernize its fleet.This deal is expected to open new routes for American Airlines across the globe, including Europe and Asia Pacific region. The deal is valued at more than $12 billion at current list prices and will make the airline Boeing’s largest 787-Dreamliner customers in Western Hemisphere.A Brief Note on Boeing 787Boeing’s 787 is the fleet of fastest selling twin-aisle jet till date. The aircraft is built with lightweight composite materials and powered by advanced engines, which is 20% more fuel efficient than Boeing 767. The models of the 787 fleet involved in this deal are the 787-8 Dreamliner, equipped to fly 242 passengers up to 7,355 nautical miles, as well as 787-9, which can fly 290 passengers up to 7,635 nautical miles.The 787 Dreamliner fleet contains Smooth Ride Technology, which allows it to sense turbulence and automatically adjust wing control surfaces for a smoother ride. Such sensors are located throughout the aircraft.Boeing and American AirlinesWith this deal, Boeing has strenghtened its relationship with American Airlines, its largest customer for more than 80 years. It currently delivers the 737 Max, Next Generation 737, 777 and 787 jets to the Seattle-based airline company. Boeing’s Global Services division provides American Airlines with efficient tools such as Airplane Health Management and Toolbox, which improves operational performanc and dispatch reliability.What’s Ahead for Boeing?Per Boeing’s latest market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. The company expects widebody jets to be a strong driver, comprising 20% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.5 trillion, over the next 20 years.Notably, with the 787 fleet leading the widebody jet space, Boeing has achieved more than 1350 orders for the same, till date. We may expect the company to win more similar orders in the quarters ahead. This in turn will add impetus to Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit, which posted revenues of $56.7 billion in 2017, improving 8% on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, it started the production rate of 787-Dreamliners at 12 per month in 2016 and plans to boost the rate to 14 per month by the end of the decade. We believe that the latest deal will enable the company to successfully achieve its targeted production rate ramp up.Price PerformanceBoeing’s shares have rallied about 83.7% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.7%.

131,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division — Electric Boat — recently clinched a modification contract for developing air conditioning unit component, which will be incorporated in Block V Virginia class boats. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by September 2022.Details of the DealValued at $16.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion and Repair, Groton, CT. Per the terms, Electric Boat will procure prototype material and manufacturing for the aforementioned air conditioning units.Majority of the work will be carried out in York, PA. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funding will be utilized to partially finance this contract.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Also, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are managed by these vessels. In fact, the Virginia-class is one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.Notably, Electric Boat is the prime contractor for the Virginia-class submarine program. This division continues to operate at a two submarines-per-year construction rate and has delivered 15 Virginia-class submarines as of 2017-end, in conjunction with Huntington Ingalls. Impressively, since the delivery of the lead Virginia-class submarine, the cost and time to deliver follow-on ships has been reduced consistently from 84 months to 66 months, while improving the mission capability and quality of the ships at the time of delivery.The remaining 13 submarines are scheduled for dispatch through 2023. This reflects that the company has opportunities to win more such contracts like the latest one, which in turn, will provide impetus to its growth story.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted for the same. Evidently, the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal for the U.S. Navy includes a request for spending $58.5 billion to buy 10 new ships, including two Virginia-class submarines. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor.Going ahead, we expect the company to win more such contracts like the latest one, which in turn, should enable it to expand footprint in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, General Dynamics’ shares have gained 2.6% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 44%. The underperformance might have been led by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are AeroVironment (AVAV  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report). While AeroVironment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AeroVironment delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 147.43% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings rose by 10 cents to $1.00 in the past 60 days.Boeing pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 29.51% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings moved north by 56 cents to $14.61 in the past 60 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

US BICES-X extends these capabilities across the Department of Defense to the different combatant commands.What is Favoring General Dynamics?Due to rising security threats, the defense budget funding’s focus has shifted toward upgrading existing capabilities and emphasizing on ISR, cyber security and space technology. Such macroeconomic factors have been boosting General Dynamics’ growth prospects, in particular its Information Systems and Technology segment, which deals with communication systems. Evidently, the segment generated revenues of $2,487 million, up 9.5%, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, General Dynamics being one of Pentagon’s prime contractors has been acquiring quite a few contracts from the Department of Defense of late. In February, its Mission Systems unit secured a $208-million contract for the delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR). Such inflow of orders, including the latest one, will enable the segment to deliver similar encouraging performance in days ahead.Its recent acquisition of CSRA Inc. is also poised to benefit General Dynamics massively. The deal makes the latter the largest provider of integrated information technology services to the federal government along with boosting its global workforce by more than 19,000 that will enable the company to speed up operations and upgrade its information systems for delivering cost-effective, next-generation IT solutions to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.Price Movement    General Dynamics’ stock has returned about 15.6% in the past one year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 45.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).

133,HII,"On Friday night, President Trump revealed that he had authorized U.S. armed forces to conduct precision military strikes on Syria. The attacks, conducted in unison with France and Britain, was a reprisal for the chemical attack ordered by the Assad regime on the rebel-held town of Duma on Apr 7. On Apr 14, Trump declared that the strikes were a success, tweeting “Mission Accomplished.”Meanwhile, Russia expressed anger over the U.S.-led missile strike on Syria. And on Sunday, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said the United States is likely to impose new sanctions against Russia because it continues to back President Assad’s regime. With recent missile strikes likely to snowball into an extended conflict, it makes sense to stock up on defense stocks.    “Mission Accomplished,” Says TrumpTrump’s order for a missile strike on Syria was a marked departure from his initial stance on the issue. As late as last week, Trump had said that he was in favor of U.S. forces withdrawing from Syria. But the situation changed drastically after Apr 7 with the President tweeting that missile strikes were likely forthcoming.On Apr 14, Trump said the missile strikes were “perfectly executed” and had accomplished their objective. Defense Secretary James Mattis also characterized the strikes as a “one time shot.” But Trump also said the United States was “prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.""Russia Warns of “Consequences”, U.S. Sanctions LikelyRussia has expressed its displeasure over the U.S. led joint strike with its ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov saying that his country’s “worst apprehensions have come true. Antonov’s statement, released on Twitter also warned that unspecified “consequences” were likely to follow.Comments from U.S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Sunday raised chances of an escalation even further. Speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Haley said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Monday. These sanctions would be targeted at “companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use.”Defense Stocks Benefit From Middle-East ConflictTogether, the United States, Russia and France launched 105 missiles on targets in Syria. Of these, 19 were JASSMs manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and 66 were Tomahawk cruise missiles made by Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). On Wednesday, shares of both these companies gained almost 1% after Trump said Russia should “get ready” for a missile attack on Syria.Meanwhile, historical data shows that U.S. defense stocks tend to outperform the broader market when the United States engages in a military offensive in the Middle-East. CNBC Analysis using Kensho shows that the S&P 500 aerospace sub-industry gained 1.5% a month after such an offensive. Over the same period, the Dow and the S&P 500 gained less than 1%. On Apr 11, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) gained 0.5% even as the S&P 500 lost 0.3%.Our ChoicesThough the Pentagon believes that the current offensive has been concluded, signs are rife that it may have only served to escalate tensions. Russia has issued strong protests against the assault and with the United States preparing to issue fresh economic sanctions, the conflict in Syria is far from over.Also, historical data shows that U.S. defense stocks gain after a military offensive in the Middle East.

134,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract to deliver 50 new 737 MAX 10 aircraft to the Lion Air Group. The deal, worth $6.24 billion at current list prices, will become the airlines’ largest order of the MAX 10 variant to date.The order is expected to enable Lion Group optimize its network and increase profitability.A Brief Note on 737 MAXBoeing’s 737 MAX family of airplanes incorporate the latest CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets, the Boeing Sky Interior and large flight deck displays. These features allow this family of jets to offer the greatest flexibility, reliability and efficiency in in the single-aisle market.Notably, the company believes that its 737 MAX 10 model will be the airlines' most profitable single-aisle airplane, offering the lowest seat costs ever.Boeing and Lion GroupLion Air, one of Boeing’s largest customers, was the first airline globally to put Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 jets into service and take delivery of the smaller 737 MAX 9 for expanding its international routes, earlier this year. Boeing currently delivers 737 Max and Next Generation 737 jets to the Jakarta-based airline company.Our ViewBoeing’s commercial business has been gaining traction in recent days, in the form of huge inflow of jet orders from airlines worldwide. The company recently received an order worth $12 billion to deliver 47 787-9 Dreamliners to American Airlines. A week back it also received orders worth $8.8 billion for 75 737 MAX Airplanes from Jet Airways.In 2017, Boeing’s revenues from its Commercial Airplanes were $56.7 billion, majorly driven by record 763 deliveries, including the delivery of the first 74 737 MAX airplanes.  Key milestones for the commercial airplane segment included the successful launch of the 737 MAX 10 and the transition of 737 production lines while increasing production of 47 airplanes per month. Boeing further anticipates the 737 MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of its total 737 deliveries in 2018.Moreover, on the commercial front, Boeing estimates demand for 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion in the next two decades. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major demand driver, accounting for 72% of the total projection along with widebody jets, comprising over 20%. Recently, the company announced first-quarter delivery numbers that reflect 9% growth in its commercial shipments, primarily backed by higher demand for 737 jets. These developments allow us to expect that Boeing will continue to maintaining its position as one of the largest aerospace contractors worldwide and is likely to deliver similar performance in coming quarters.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 86% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.2%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and for its military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

135,HII,"Rising fears of a trade war between China and the United States unnerved investors, sending Wall Street on a bumpy ride for past few weeks. In particular, the market tumbled on President Trump’s proposal of imposing a tariff of $60 billion on Chinese imports. In retaliation China threatened to levy a hefty tariff on a number of American goods.  However, these developments did not have any major impact on the U.S. defense stocks. In fact, the recent joint venture (JV) that aircraft major Boeing formed with Saudi Arabian Military Industries is likely to keep the U.S. defense industry on a growth trajectory. The deal is also likely to boost the growth prospects of other defense majors as well. Evidently, a few of them have already started to win contracts from Saudi Arabia. Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the green over the past five trading sessions. Both the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index rose 1.7%, over that time frame. Moreover, keeping with its usual trend, the U.S. defense industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon over the trailing five sessions.Among the highlights of the last week, defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)  secured a number of orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. General Dynamics completed the CSRA acquisition.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Raytheon secured a contract fordelivering Patriot Missile Systems to Poland, after the country signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (“LOA”) agreement with the U.S. government.Per Reuters, this deal, valued at $4.75 billion, requires Raytheon to deliver two Patriot System Batteries, each with two fire units in 2022. This is a major achievement for Raytheon, since in spite of the U.S. State Department having cleared a potential $10.5 billion sale of four Patriot defense systems to Poland last November, the deal got stuck in cross-border negotiations.Per the agreement, Raytheon will continue to work with Polish defense companies and help them build key parts of the missile system (read more: Raytheon to Gain From US-Poland $4.8B Deal for Patriot). 2. Boeing won a contract worth $1.2 billion for providing long-lead non-recurring engineering to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets.

136,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $117-million modification contract under the foreign military sales (FMS) program for the delivery of Modernized Laser Range Finder Designators (LRFD) to support Netherlands’ AH-64 Apache helicopter.

LRFD is also the chief targeting aid for Boeing's (BA  -  Free Report)  AH-64 Apache helicopter, establishing the range to target for accurate weapon aiming.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon. The company recently acquired a $211-million contract for upgrading its F-35 fighter jet and secured a $1.5-billion deal for delivering F-35's Spare Parts last month. Notably, Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics segment witnessed 13% year-over-year sales growth in 2017.We may expect such contract wins, like the latest one, to boost the Aeronautics segment, which in turn will reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 and beyond.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft related programs. Such a significant budget spending policy reflects solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics segment in coming days.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 29.7% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 50.1%.

137,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently clinched a modification contract for purchasing missile tube long-lead-time material to support the Columbia-class fleet ballistic missile submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2023.Details of the DealValued at $126.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The agreement is a joint U.S./U.K. Common Missile Compartment program, work for which will be carried out in Quonset Point, RI. The U.S. Navy will purchase 72% of the modification, while the government of the U.K. will acquire the remaining 28%, under the Foreign Military Sales program.Fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy); and U.K. funding will be utilized to finance the majority portion of the task.A Brief Note on Columbia-class SubmarineThe Columbia-class submarine program, formerly known as the Ohio replacement submarine program, was designed by the Navy to replace its existing force of 14 Trident-armed Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of 12 ballistic missile submarines. Originally built by Electric Corp., the Columbia-class submarines are also operated by the U.K., Russia, China, France and India.Under the Navy’s Submarine Unified Build Strategy, the Columbia-class submarines will be jointly constructed by General Dynamics’ Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (HII  -  Free Report) Newport New division. However, the Navy has requested General Dynamics to continue as the prime contractor for designing and building the Columbia-class boats.Why General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics is a leading Navy contractor. Apart from this, the company continues to be a prime contractor for the development of Virginia-class submarines (another class of nuclear-powered submarine), with Huntington acting as the subcontractor.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget which included investment provisions worth $3.7 billion for Columbia-Class Submarine. With General Dynamics being a prime contractor, we may expect the company to win more such contracts like the latest one, which will undoubtedly poise the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics’ stock has rallied about 8.1% in past three months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 6.3%. The outperformance may have been driven by the company’s consistent focus on research and development, diverse customer base and an attractive product mix.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

138,HII,"General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of IT service provider CSRA Inc. . After engaging in a brief period of bidding war against CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics successfully acquired CSRA on Apr 3, for $9.7 billion, which includes a $2.8 billion debt.CSRA has thus become part of General Dynamics’ Information Systems & Technology segment. Following the closure of the transaction, General Dynamics has acquired all of CSRA’s outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash and subsequently the latter’s shares will get delisted  from the NYSE.Brief History of the Deal    Interestingly, following General Dynamics’ proposal to buy CASR last month for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt, CACI offered to pay $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover. However, General Dynamics revised its acquisition deal with CSRA on Mar 20 stating that it will acquire all of CSRA’s outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash, reflecting an increase of 50 cents from the previous proposal. Consequently, CACI withdrew its buyout offer, thereby leaving General Dynamics as the sole prospective acquirer.  Benefits of the DealThe deal will poise General Dynamics as the largest provider of integrated information technology services to the federal government as CSRA is known for its cyber security and data-analytics business along with its information technology know-how.The acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to the company’s earnings per share and cash flow next year. Further, the deal is expected to generate annual pre-tax cost savings of 2% of the combined company's revenue by 2020.The takeover will boost General Dynamics’s global workforce by more than 19,000. With such an addition, the company’s combined workforce can speed up operations and upgrade their information systems and deliver cost-effective, next-generation IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.What Lies Ahead for General Dynamics?In the age of digitization, widespread cyber attacks have prompted all nations to improve their cyber security. The United States, being the largest digitally advanced country, is no exception.Per a report published by Forrester, global purchases for technology software and services by businesses and governments will grow by 4% and software and tech consulting services by 6% in 2018. Therefore, the latest buyout by General Dynamics seems to be a strategic step taken to expand its footprint in the cyber security space.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock returned about 17.6% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key PickGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

139,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) Ingalls Shipbuilding business unit recently secured a modification contract for carrying out emergent repair and restoration of USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62).  The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.The deal, valued at $27.5 million, also entails for the additional collision repairs along with the maintenance and modernization of the USS Fitzgerald. Work related to the deal will be executed in Pascagoula, MS and is scheduled to get completed by January 2020. Huntington Ingalls will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on USS FitzgeraldThe USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) is a guided missile destroyer battleship belonging to the Arleigh Burke class of surface ships, currently serving the U.S. Navy. While DD represents the basic destroyers per US Navy classifications, G stands for its guided missile armament design. It is built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multifunction passive electronically scanned array radar.What’s Favoring Huntington Ingalls?Huntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. More than 70% of the active Navy fleet comprises ships from this company. The company’s Ingalls Shipbuilding unit is the largest supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants and has built nearly 70% of the U.S. Navy fleet of warships, till date.Notably, Huntington Ingalls’ revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, which increased 8.7% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by higher volumes in amphibious ships at the Ingalls business division along with higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services at Newport shipbuilding. We expect the company’s Ingalls division to efficiently improve the construction and modernization of shipbuilding programs in the upcoming quarters and significantly contribute to its revenue growth, thereby.Furthermore, the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal 2019 U.S. defense budget last month, which provisions for a spending of $18.3 billion on shipbuilding and increasing the end strength for the U.S. Navy. These developments reflect massive growth prospects for shipbuilding giants like Huntington Ingalls, increasing its chances of acquiring major shipbuilding contracts. This, in turn, will boost the company’sprofit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington Ingalls rallied about 12.4% in a year compared with the industry’s 28.1% growth. The underperformance might have been caused due to intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Textron and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

140,HII,"On Jun 22, the European Union (EU) slapped tariffs on $3.2 billion of American products in response to taxes imposed on steel and aluminum by the United States. It seems like trade tensions have rapidly spread to other parts of the world in a ripple effect of the ongoing dispute between America and China over tariff impositions and trade protectionism issues.Unfortunately, global stocks were caught in crossfire as is evident from their underperformance over the past five trading sessions. Consequently, a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon was not sufficient to boost the aerospace and defense stocks. Evidently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — dropped 0.6% in the last five trading sessions.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) — secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for June 21, 2018 here)Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1.

141,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business segment, Newport News, recently secured a contract for the accomplishment of repair, alteration, maintenance, and/or modernization requirements on Navy nuclear aircraft carriers. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by October 2022.Details of the DealValued at $91 million, the contract was awarded by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. Per the terms, the aforementioned tasks will be carried out in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS and IMF) supported locations. It will be executed by personnel who are uniquely trained, qualified, and authorized to perform nuclear carrier propulsion plant maintenance.Moreover, under the agreement, the PSNS and IMF labor force will accomplish time critical propulsion plant and plant related work on nuclear-powered aircraft carriers scheduled for repair, alteration and/or modernization over the next five years. Notably, the nuclear propulsion plant related efforts include technical support, planning, maintenance, repairs, corrective measures, testing and performance evaluations, and modernization efforts. Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Bremerton, WA. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized to partially finance the contract.Huntington Ingalls’ Expertise in Aircraft CarriersAircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet. Notably, Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News has designed and built more than 30 aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy since 1933. These include all 10 Nimitz class (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in active service and the first ship of the next generation Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.In 2017, the company delivered the U.S. Navy's newest carrier — USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) — and continues to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH). It is currently performing the RCOH of USS George Washington (CVN 73). The aforementioned developments reflect the valued experience that Huntington Ingalls has in constructing nuclear aircraft carriers.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the United States. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of this company’s ships.Also, this military shipbuilder’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. As a result, this division frequently secures shipbuilding related contracts from the U.S. Navy and the country’s foreign allies. In the first quarter of 2018, this segment witnessed more than 11% sales improvement owing to higher revenues in naval nuclear support services and aircraft carriers.Considering this division’s proven expertise in delivering top-notch aircraft carriers to the U.S. Navy, we may expect the company to go on winning contracts like the latest one. This, in turn, is likely to enable the Newport News division to deliver solid top-line result in quarters ahead.The U.S. budget proposal for fiscal 2019 includes incremental funding for nuclear aircraft carriers, CVN-79 and CVN-80. For CVN-78, the financial plan aims at spending $1.8 billion.Moreover, the fiscal 2019 baseline budget submission of $179.1 billion for the Department of the Navy reflects an increase of 4% from the fiscal 2018 budget request. Such impressive budget plan further strengthens growth prospect for shipbuilders like Huntington Ingalls.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied about 13.1% compared with the broader industry’s 41.3% gain. The underperformance can be attributed to the company’s limited commercial exposure and high debt levels that increases its vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Huntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are AeroVironment (AVAV  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report). While AeroVironment sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has moved up by 56 cents to $14.61 in the past 60 days.Wesco Aircraft came up with a positive earnings surprise of 29.41% in the first quarter 2018.

142,HII,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense Space and Security segment recently won a $312-million ceiling increase modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kits. The contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah.Details of the DealPer the terms, Boeing will offer additional JDAM strap-on inertial guidance kits that would receive guidance updates from global positioning systems. These upgrades will enhance the accuracy of conventional inventory bombs.Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be completed by Mar 30, 2020. Boeing will utilize fiscal 2018 procurement, operations and maintenance funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on JDAMJDAM is a low-cost guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into guided weapons accurately. The JDAM kit consists of a new tail section that contains an inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) and body strakes for additional stability and lift. With the help of JDAM, bombs can be accurately delivered in any weather conditions and be launched at a great distance from the target.The U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and the militaries of more than 26 additional countries employ JDAM. Its latest version, JDAM Extended Range features a modular add-on wing kit that will unfold in flight. The kit can also be coupled with other modular enhancements such as laser sensors.Our ViewBoeing Defense Space and Security (BDS) segment delivered a solid performance last year in terms of revenues and margins along with securing key contracts and achieving critical program milestones, including its ongoing progress on the tanker program. Impressively, the BDS segment was able to clinch massive orders totaling $10 billion during fourth-quarter 2017.Moreover, the segment witnessed an approximate 5% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter revenues to $5.54 billion, driven by higher weapon deliveries. The company’s backlog for the segment was $50 billion. We expect contract wins like the latest one to enable the company to deliver such notable performance in quarters ahead as well.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a $3-billion investment in Boeing’s 15 KC-46 Tanker Replacements, $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18s, $1.3 billion for 60 AH-64E Attack Helicopters and $2.2 billion for 10 P-8A jets.  Moreover, the company has of late been witnessing solid funding support above the President's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and space launch system.These are indicative of the fact that Boeing, being one of the primary defense contractors in the United States, can be expected to win more defense contracts in the days to come, which in turn will boost its profit margin substantially.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 84.9 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47.3%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft as well as military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

(KBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that the Australian Government has selected the NSI (Aust) Pty Ltd (NSI), a joint-venture company of Kellogg Brown & Root Pty Ltd (KBR  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Australia Pty Ltd (HII  -  Free Report), for setting up and managing the country’s Naval Shipbuilding College (NSC). Estimated revenues related to this project will be booked as unfilled orders in the Government Services business segment.About the DealAs joint venture partners, KBR and Huntington will provide NSC with a complementary combination of attributes and industry workforce training experience. This will enable NSC to deliver the right workforce armed with efficient skills for the Naval Shipbuilding Program.Also, NSI has brought together a team from various organizations across Australia.

Going ahead, KBR expects all its key markets in the United States, the UK and Australia to perform exceedingly well driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects. Meanwhile, its long-term prospects remain strong, with an increasing portfolio of smaller and OpEx-facing projects, services, program management and maintenance contracts.Furthermore, the company seems to be improving its growth potential and expanding market share through acquisition of companies or assets.

146,HII,"Per Reuters, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently entered into an agreement with the second largest Indian-based airline — Jet Airways — for delivering 75 737 MAX narrow body aircrafts. The deal is in line with Indian airlines’ latest rush to expand their fleets to meet the rising demand in the country for both domestic and international flights.The deal value amounts to approximately $8.8 billion at current list prices which might get lower once the deal finalizes, as airlines typically receive a significant discount on big orders from manufacturers. However, it is still unknown whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding.Boeing’s Prospects in IndiaDue to the increase in airborne passenger and cargo traffic, major airlines from all over the world, including Indian based airlines, are increasing their fleet size to meet the growing demand. According to the International Air Transport Association, the domestic Indian passenger traffic witnessed a 17.5% rise in January 2018 from the previous year.In light of these developments, India has emerged as a promising market for Boeing, with the country expected to become the world’s fastest growing aviation market. According to the company, the country will need 2,100 new planes worth $290 billion in the next 20 years, up 13.5% from the year-ago estimate of 1,850 planes. Indian airlines currently have a fleet of 490 planes and ordered 880 more planes.No doubt the latest deal with Jet Airways reflects the expanding jetliner demand in India and Boeing, being the largest jet maker in the world, will surely benefit from it.Q4 Deliveries Driven by 737 FleetBoeing reported fourth-quarter 2017 commercial deliveries of 209 airplanes, up 13% year over year backed by higher demand for 737 and 747 jets. Sequentially, the numbers went up 3.5%. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 148 in the fourth quarter compared to 122 jets a year ago. This shows that the 737 fleet drives the company’s quarterly deliveries and order wins and the upcoming quarters will be no exception.What’s Ahead for Boeing?Per Boeing’s latest market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. The company expects single-aisle jets to be the major demand growth driver, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, over the next 20 years.Notably, with the 737 fleet leading the single-aisle jet space, we expect the company to win more such orders like the latest one, for this fleet in quarters ahead. This in turn will provide further impetus to Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit, which garnered revenues of $56.7 billion in 2017, driven by 763 and 737 MAX airplane deliveries.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 85.1 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for commercial and military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1, and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

147,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $279-million modification contract for Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles under the foreign military sales (FMS) program. Per the deal, the company will enhance the PAC-3 missiles production contract to include cost reduction initiative (CRI) missiles and associated ground support equipment. The deal will cater to Saudi Arabia.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL and Huntsville, AL.Lockheed Martin will utilize other procurement (Army) funds in fiscal 2018 to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2023.A Brief Note on PAC-3 Missile SystemThe PAC-3 is a long-range, air-defense and medium- to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.The PAC-3 Missile is a high-velocity interceptor that defeats incoming targets by a direct, body-to-body impact. PAC-3 Missiles, when deployed in a Patriot battery, significantly increase the Patriot system’s firepower, since 16 PAC-3s load-out on a Patriot launcher compared with four Patriot PAC-2 missiles. The company anticipates demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.What’s Favoring Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin’s PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones in the fourth quarter of 2017. It was successful in neutralizing four tactical ballistic missile targets in a complex test in New Mexico that eventually led to the initiation of full-rate production for PAC-3 MSE interceptors.Being Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin has been acquiring contracts from the Department of Defense, as well as from its international clients, for its PAC-3 missiles. In February 2018, the company won a $524 million contract for the production of PAC-3 enhancement missiles and it also clinched a $945 million deal for the same at the end of 2017.Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control segment, which is the primary contractor for the PAC-3 defense missiles and interceptors, recorded fourth-quarter 2017 net sales of $2.3 billion, reflecting a solid 31% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We believe that such inflow of orders for its PAC-3 missiles will enable Lockheed Martin to garner similar top-line growth in the quarter ahead.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed a fiscal 2019 defense budget that provides for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, being a premier missile developer, is expected to gain significantly from this provision.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has improved 24% in the last year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corp. (CW  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

148,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a delivery order to provide F/A-18 planned maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support. This is a five-year contract with no option periods.Valued at $430 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. Work related to the deal will be carried out in Missouri, California, Florida and North Carolina and is expected to be completed by Mar 29, 2023.Defense working capital funds for fiscal 2018 through 2023 will be utilized to finance the task.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.Boeing believes that the Super Hornet is the most cost-effective aircraft in the U.S. tactical aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other tactical aircraft in U.S. forces inventory.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. With aeroplanes being its flagship product, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F/A-18 jets.Evidently, the Fiscal 2018 budget required 80 Super Hornets over the next five years as part of the Future Years Defense Program, including funding for Research Development, Test & Evaluation for Block III capabilities.  Moreover, the U.S. Navy added an additional 10 Super Hornets into the FY18 budget as its No. 1 unfunded priority.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, Boeing willsurely be a significant beneficiary once this budget gets Senate’s approval. The budget also includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts.Notably, these developments, along with the latest contract win should provide impetus to Boeing’s defense segment’s growth, which generated revenues of $5.54 billion in the last reported quarter.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing’s stock has surged about 82.5 % compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.6%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

150,HII,"Leverage, in particular financial leverage, is a popular investment strategy of using borrowed capital to finance the expansion of business, purchase of inventory and other assets as well as support other aspects of business operations.While there exists option for equity financing, historically, debt financing has achieved more popularity among corporations when compared to equity financing. This is because, on availing debt financing, the company’s equity does not get diluted as a result of issuing more shares of the stock. In other words, the borrower has no claim in the company’s shares.Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt financing has got its own drawbacks. It tends to shoot up the company’s risk of bankruptcy. This is because companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns.In fact, the related amount of interest expense may overwhelm the borrower if it does not earn sufficient returns to offset the interest expense. This is particularly a problem when interest rates rise or the returns from assets decline.With the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States being in favor of interest rate hikes, the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowers.Nevertheless, this does not mean that equity investments are too risky and investing in stocks might not lead to perceived returns. After all, in spite of such high debt levels, the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP, representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figures.Considering this, the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently, avoiding those that carry high debt loads. So the crux of a safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap. Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.As we have reached the end of Q1, the growth picture seems to be improving compared to what we saw in the year-ago quarter. Naturally, investors must be gearing up to pour money in stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But in the uncertain world of investment, markets can falter anytime, particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage. Therefore, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 64 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report): The company manufactures building materials and engineered wood products in the United States, Canada, Chile and Brazil.

153,HII,"It was a sigh of relief in the Wall Street when major indices ended in the green on the first trading day of the week, as talks between the United States and China on trade agreement began. But experts believe that the market will take some time to recover from the damage inflicted by escalated trade tensions between the world's biggest economies and the Facebook data fiasco.Keeping aside the recent market gyrations, market pundits are of the opinion that the economy is not in a bad shape after all. The Fed’s optimistic view also throws light on the same. The Fed Chairperson envisions economy growth of 2.7% in 2018, up from the previous forecast of 2.5%. The sound fundamentals only raises hope that the recent market volatility will be short-lived.Quite obvious, corporate tax reform, infrastructure spending, rising consumer sentiment, robust job market and strengthening manufacturing activity are working in tandem to cushion the market.

155,HII,"Wall Street witnessed brutal trading last week, with the major indices suffering the worst weekly fall in more than two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 tumbled 5.7% and 5.9%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 6.5%. The Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)-led tech selloff, Fed rates hike, and a trade war brewing between the United States and China were the major culprits.However, the worries seem to be abating, thanks to the news that the Trump administration has agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs and start negotiating with China to avert a global trade war, which has threatened economic growth and hammered financial markets around the world.Last week, Trump signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports targeting the technology, telecommunications and apparel sectors. In response, China has proposed a list of 128 U.S. products worth $3 billion as potential retaliation targets. The list includes wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng, with a potential 15% duty, and pork and recycled aluminum goods with a possible 25% tariff.Global trade tensions are likely to threaten the nine-year bull market in the weeks ahead, as talks between the two countries are yet to unfold and thus, keep volatility alive. As a result, most investors’ are still cautious as to how the negotiations will take place and what its impact on the financial world will be. Further, Washington turmoil and geopolitical tensions will continue to weigh on the stocks.Bulls Remain IntactAside from trade war fears, long-term market fundamentals remained bullish. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals, strong corporate earnings and the new tax legislation are the biggest catalysts for the stock market this year. Additionally, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and record consumer confidence.In particular, the massive $1.5-trillion tax cut is expected to provide a huge boost to stocks. This is because it will create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities and fat dividends.Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have gone up, with tax law changes being the most notable reason for the positive revisions. These revisions are broad-based, with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 18% on 5.6% higher revenues for 2018. For 2019, earnings and revenues for the index are expected to be up 9.5% and 4.1%, respectively.Given the bullish trends, we have highlighted some stock-picking ideas from the top-ranked cohort for investors that could prove extremely beneficial in the current market environment, reducing the risk of a downside:Low-Beta StocksLow-beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Though these have lesser risks and lower returns, the stocks are considered safe and resilient.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) having beta of 0.20 seems a good bet in this category. Based in Springdale, AR, it is one of the world’s largest producers of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods, offering a wide range of protein-based and prepared foods products. It has an expected earnings growth of 25.24% for the year (ending September 2018). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Value StocksValue stocks have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets. These stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued. These have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts.The Missouri-based Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. It has a Value Score of A and an estimated earnings growth of 40.95% for this year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.Small-Cap StocksEven though small-cap stocks were victims of the broad-market selloff last week, they hold up much better than the larger ones. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance.Texas-based Conns Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) could be an intriguing choice given its projected earnings growth of 174.62% for the year (ending January 2019). This is a specialty retailer engaged in the selling of home appliances, including refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers and ranges, and a variety of consumer electronics, including projection, plasma and LCD televisions, camcorders, VCRs, DVD players and home theater products. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A.Quality StocksQuality investing also seeks safety and protection against volatility. Quality stocks tend to outperform as these are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth.Tennessee-based Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) manufactures building materials and engineered wood products in the United States, Canada, Chile and Brazil. It has a low debt/equity ratio of 0.22, 5-Year historical EPS growth of 10.34%, an estimated growth rate of 3% for sales and 12.45% for earnings this year, and a dividend yield of 1.86%. The stock further belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 6%), and sports a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of A.Dividend StocksThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these world’s — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that pay dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis.While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Virginia-based Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) having a strong history of dividend growth seems to be a good pick. The company designs, builds and maintains nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and provides after-market services for military ships around the globe. Though the yield is lower at 1.13%, the stock has 5-year historical dividend growth of 51.28% and estimated earnings growth of 43.16%. HII carries a Zacks Rank #1 and VGM Score of B.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

156,HII,"Over the last week, Wall Street saw first-quarter 2018 earnings releases from several defense biggies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics.

Notably, the beat ratio for the bottom line was 76.8%, while that for top line was 73.8%.Therefore, the results reflect a strong show so far, with Q1 earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Coming to the Zacks Aerospace sector, projections for the stocks in this space, hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its fourth-quarter performance. Evidently, the sector's earnings are likely to improve 37.3% on 7.5% higher revenues in the first quarter, whereas fourth-quarter earnings for this sector improved 31.8% on 7.3% revenue growth. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Stocks in the aerospace-defense space remained on a growth trajectory in the first quarter, courtesy of fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal presented by President Trump. Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution. A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.With almost 921 companies (142 S&P 500 members) are slated to report first-quarter results this week, let's take a look at how the following defense stocks are poised before their earnings release on May 3.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.51% in the last reported quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.85%.Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News segment, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last few years. However, in the last few reported quarters, this segment’s top line has rebounded.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Newport News unit’s first-quarter revenues stands at $1,012 million, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.2%. A steady inflow of orders from the Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls’ results. However, in the first quarter, the company did not win any notable contracts.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

157,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a contract for providing long-lead non-recurring engineering to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets. These services will be rendered to the government of Kuwait.Details of the DealValued at $1.2 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms, Boeing will offer long-lead radar warning receivers and aircraft armament equipment. The deal is expected to be completed by September 2022.Majority of the work will be executed in Hazelwood, MI; Goleta and EL Segundo,CA; while the remaining portion will be carried out in different parts across the United States. Foreign military sales funds will be utilized to partially finance the task.A Brief Note on F/A-18E/FBoeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.The F/A-18E and F/A-18/F are two varieties of the F/A-18 family of military jets.Boeing believes that the Super Hornet is the most cost-effective aircraft in the U.S. tactical aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other tactical aircraft in U.S. forces inventory.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. With aeroplanes being its flagship product, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F/A-18 jets.Evidently, the Fiscal 2018 budget required 80 Super Hornets over the next five years as part of the Future Years Defense Program, including funding for Research Development, Test & Evaluation for Block III capabilities.  Moreover, the U.S. Navy added an additional 10 Super Hornets into the FY18 budget as its No. 1 unfunded priority.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary once this budget gets Senate’s approval, which also includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts. Surely these developments, along with the latest contract win, will provide impetus to Boeing’s defense segment’s growth, which generated  revenues worth $5.54 billion, in the last reported quarter.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 85.6 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.7%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft.  Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

159,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, this military shipbuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.51%. Coming to expectations for the first quarter of 2018, while higher aircraft carriers’ volume is likely to keep the Newport News segment on its toe, tax reform is anticipated to boost earnings growth.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Newport News – A Key CatalystHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last few years. However, in the past couple of reported quarters, this segment’s top line has rebounded to a positive growth trajectory.In particular, higher volumes in aircraft carriers and Navy nuclear support services have been boosting the top line at this segment. We expect first-quarter results to reflect similar trends, which in turn is likely to bolster the segment’s quarterly revenues.  In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Newport News unit’s first-quarter revenues stands at $1,012 million, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.2%.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. QuoteTax Reform: A BoonManagement at Huntington Ingalls believes that the recent adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by U.S. administration has created an opportunity for the company to increase its investments. Per the company, the latest Tax Reform will allow Huntington Ingalls to push up its investment in Shipbuilding business by $300 million. These investments, in turn, will expand operational capacity at the Ingalls segment and increase investment in digital tools to improve operational efficiencies at Newport News. We believe this will get translated into improved earnings growth for the company, which is expected to be partially reflected in the upcoming quarterly result.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Huntington Ingalls’ first-quarter earnings of $4.07, represents an annual improvement of 117.7%.Dearth of Order in Q1: A Killjoy?A steady inflow of orders from Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls’ results. However, in the first quarter, the company won not many notable contracts. Nevertheless, considering solid contributions from Camber acquisition along with robust sales volume as well as Navy nuclear support services boom, overall sales growth expectation for Huntington Ingalls’ first quarter remains positive. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, implying a 2.4% year-over-year increase.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsHuntington Ingalls does not possess the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Huntington Ingalls has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the Aerospace sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2.

160,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) segment, Space Systems, recently secured a $928-million modification contract for the development of hypersonic conventional strike weapon. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.Details of the DealPer the terms, Lockheed Martin will offer the design, engineering, systems integration, test, logistics planning, and aircraft integration support of all the elements of a hypersonic, conventional, air-launched, stand-off weapon.Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Huntsville; AL. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on Hypersonic WeaponA hypersonic weapon, considered as high-speed maneuvering weapon, is a missile that travels five times faster than the speed of sound. Its extraordinary speed and precision help a hypersonic weapon to hit any target, anywhere in the world, in less than an hour.According to CNBC, currently two types of hypersonic weapons are in development: hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. While, hypersonic cruise missiles can fly at altitudes up to 100,000 feet, hypersonic glide vehicles can fly above 100,000 feet.Our ViewReportedly, the United States, Russia and China are the forerunners in developing hypersonic weapons. However, both Russia and China have moved ahead of the United States in hypersonic weapon technologies innovation. As a result, in case such a weapon is deployed on the U.S. soils, the nation doesn’t have sufficient defense to protect itself. In fact, Air Force Gen. John Hyten, himself has expressed doubt regarding the U.S.’s ability to defend itself against such weapon. This in turn might constrain the U.S. military’s global presence and impede its ability to project force in key regions.Consequently, the U.S. government is pursuing development of a range of hypersonic weapons to ensure superiority over China and Russia’s growing hypersonic arsenal. This is evident from the fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions an increase in the research and development funds by $18 billion, which includes upgrading the country’s hypersonic technology. Such investments on hypersonic weapons along with the latest contract win will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s top line in the days ahead.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 30.2% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 50.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report),  Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).

(BA  -  Free Report), secured a contract for its satellite launch services. Per the terms, United Launch Services, LLC (“ULS”) — the subsidiary — will deliver AFSPC-8 and AFSPC-12 satellites to their intended orbit.Details of the DealAwarded by the Contracting Division, Launch Systems Enterprise Directorate, Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA and is valued at $354.8 million.Per the modification contract, ULS will carry out launch vehicle production, mission integration, launch operations and spaceflight certification for the AFSPC-8 and AFSPC-12 missions.Operations will be completed by March 2020 to deliver the AFSPC-12 satellites.

It has three launch vehicles — Atlas V, Delta IV and Delta II. ULA's launch vehicles have played a major role in the U.S. space ventures, with high commitment toward crew safety and mission success.Our ViewULS has been serving as the nation’s launch services provider with its Delta IV and Atlas V rockets for more than a decade. The subsidiary incorporates latest technologies to ensure mission success within a reasonable cost. Till date, ULS has successfully launched more than 100 satellites in the orbit, which provide critical information to the military and enable personal device-based GPS navigation.With increasing number of threats in the cyber security space, military satellites like AFSPC-8 and AFSPC-12 have emerged as an integral component for national security. To enhance defense capabilities, the United States has been making major investments, especially during President Trump’s tenure. The recently released fiscal 2019 defense budget proposes provisions for space investment of $4.3 billion to strengthen the nation’s space capabilities,  including launch vehicles and satellites.This indicates possibilities for more contract wins, which will boost the growth trajectory of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s shares have gained 23.1% in the last year, compared with the broader industry’s rally of 43.4%. The underperformance was caused by intense competition in the domestic and international markets. Meanwhile, Boeing’s shares have gained 84.8%, compared with the broader industry’s rally.

163,HII,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently secured an $83.3 million contract from the Federal Business Opportunities website for designing, testing and deploying the Barracuda mine neutralization system. The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Majority of operations related to the deal will be carried out in Portsmouth, RI and in DeLeon Springs, FL. Raytheon will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds to partially finance the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by November 2022. The cumulative value of the contract will amount to $362.7 million, if options included in the deal are exercised.A Brief on the Barracuda Mine Neutralization SystemA mine neutralizer is a small unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), typically with an explosive warhead that navigates to the known location of an ocean mine located on the water's surface, tethered to the bottom, or attached to the ocean bottom.The Barracuda mine neutralization system is an expendable, semi-autonomous UUV used to identify and neutralize bottom, near surface and drifting sea mines.  The U.S. Navy expects it to be an expendable modular neutralizer consisting of a kill mechanism, propulsion, sensors, and communications buoy that enable wireless communication to the deployment platform.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Seaborne mines remain a major threat to naval and maritime forces worldwide. Raytheon’s mine neutralization system is specifically designed to counter such threats that neutralizes moored and bottom mines by using helicopters, which makes mine clearance safer.As geopolitical tensions keep rising across the globe, there is a growing trend among nations worldwide to increase warfare budget for strengthening defense system. As a result, defense giants like Raytheon benefits a great deal as navy forces bank on mine neutralization systems for the safety of ships and submarines.These in turn tend to boost the revenues of defense contractors like Raytheon. Evidently, the company recorded fourth-quarter 2017 revenues of $6,783 million that marks an 8% year-over-year growth. We expect the latest mine neutralization contract to drive the company’s revenues in the days ahead as well.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions an investment of $5.8 billion on Ground Systems. Raytheon being one of the United States top missile makers was allocated $12.9 billion for missile defense. We believe these developments, along with the latest contract wins, will enable increased growth prospects for Raytheon in the days to come.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock has returned about 48.6% in the last 12 months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 39.2%. The outperformance was primarily led by strong domestic and international sales along with a robust balance sheet.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).

165,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat, recently clinched a modification contract worth $696.2 million for supplying long lead time materials for the construction of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 Virginia-class submarines.Details of the DealMajority of the work related to the deal will be carried out in Sunnyvale, CA; while the rest will be executed in different parts across the United States as well as Loanhead, United Kingdom. The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Per the terms, the deal will offer long lead time material for steam and electric plant components; the main propulsion unit efforts and ship service turbine generator efforts; and miscellaneous hull, mechanical and electrical system components. Fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task by January 2019.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. Nations are strategically strengthening their arsenal and naval power by upgrading submarines as widespread geo-political tensions loom large.Notably, Electric Boat is the prime contractor for the Navy’s Virginia-class submarine program. It continues to operate at a two submarines-per-year construction rate and has delivered 15 Virginia-class submarines as of 2017-end, in conjunction with Huntington Ingalls. Impressively, since the delivery of the lead Virginia-class submarine, the cost and time to deliver follow-on ships has been reduced consistently and significantly, from 84 months to 66 months, while improving the mission capability and quality of the ships at the time of delivery.The remaining 13 submarines under contract are scheduled for despatchthrough 2023. This reflects that the company has opportunities to win more such contracts like the latest one, in relation to supporting the construction of these 13 submarines, which in turn will provide impetus to its growth story.The recently announced budget proposal made by Trump provisions a spending of $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding. The latest budget includes $7.4 billion for buying 2 Virginia-Class Submarines, for which General Dynamics is the prime contractor. This in turn is expected to further strengthen the company’s position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, General Dynamics’ shares have rallied 17.2% compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.6%. The underperformance may have been led by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksGeneral Dynamics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report)) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2022.A Brief Note on THAAD and PATRIOTThe THAAD is an anti-missile system that uses a hit-to-kill approach to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. It has a 100% mission success in flight testing since 2005.Whereas, PAC-3 missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system, designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Being the Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin regularly wins contracts for its varied missile segments that include both THAAD and PAC-3 missiles. In February, the company won a $524-million contract for the production of PAC-3 enhancement missiles and toward the end of January 2018, it clinched $459-million deal for the production and delivery of interceptors for the THAAD weapon system.Such inflow of orders for its varied missiles boosts Lockheed Martin’s top line. Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment recorded net sales of $2.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, reflecting a solid 31% improvement from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, is expected to gain significantly from this provision, which includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 82 THAAD missiles and $1.7 billion for the procurement of 43 AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense systems. We believe these developments, along with the latest contract wins, will enable Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment to deliver similar solid performance in first quarter as well.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 29.9% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 49.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).

168,HII,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract to deliver Patriot Missile Systems to Poland, after the country signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (“LOA”) agreement with the U.S. government for these missiles systems. The contract turned out to be Poland’s biggest arms deal till date and also made it the 15th nation and 7th NATO member to rely on Raytheon’s Patriot System.Per Reuters, this deal valued at $4.75 billion requires Raytheon to deliver two Patriot System Batteries, each with two fire units in 2022. This is a major achievement for Raytheon, since in spite of the U.S. State Department having cleared a potential $10.5 billion sale of four Patriot defense systems to Poland last November, the deal got stuck in cross-border negotiations.Per the agreement, Raytheon will continue to work with Polish defense companies and help them build key parts of the missile system.Rationale Behind the DealIt is widely anticipated that Poland signed this deal to strengthen its defense capabilities against rising threats from Russia. According to NATO planners, Russia is using its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad as well as Crimea to block NATO’s air access to the Baltic states, which represents about a third of Poland.Naturally this deal form part of Poland’s defense strategy to brace itself from the wraths of Russia, as with two-thirds of the nation’s current weaponry dates back to times of Cold War.Our ViewRaytheon’s Patriot system not only has a strong share in domestic market alone but also expanded its international realm in recent times, in nations like Qatar, Korea, Kuwait and others. In this regard, Sweden is expected to sign a LOA in mid-2018, which approximately worth $1 billion. Inevitably, Raytheon frequently enjoys a solid inflow of missile contracts from overseas and the latest deal with Poland is an evidence ofthat.Moreover, Raytheon hopes the Polish purchase of Patriot may open up new opportunities for the company to supply a more modern Patriot system to Germany, which has not yet signed a contract for Lockheed Martin’s MEADS system. If Germany does sign a deal for purchase of Patriot in near future, surely Raytheon’s international sale growth will get a solid boost.With increasing geopolitical tension worldwide and President Trump’s proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget (that provisioned $12.9 billion for missile defense) last month, demand for such improved weaponry has been on the rise. Raytheon, being one of the top missile makers in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary from the proposed budget, which also includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 240 Patriot Missile Segment Enhancements.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock has returned about 38.9% in the last 12 months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 32.7%. The outperformance was primarily led by strong domestic and international sales along with a robust balance sheet.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

169,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a $34.4-million modification contract for providing F/A-18A-F and EA-18G aircraft’s integrated product support and equipment engineering services. The services will be rendered to the Navy and the governments of Australia, Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Switzerland, Canada, and Spain.  Details of the DealPer the contract, Boeing will offer product support management, design interfacing, sustaining engineering, supply support, maintenance planning and provisioning, technical data updates, support equipment engineering as well as training and software integration services. The deal was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Majority of the work will be carried out in St. Louis, MI, while the rest would be performed in El Segundo, CA; Bethpage, NY and San Diego, CA. Work related to the deal is schedule to be completed in December 2018. The company will use Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds will be utilized to finance the task.Under the Foreign Military Sales program, the U.S. Navy will procure 85% of the contract value whereas the government of Australia would account for 9% of the same in order to get the work started. Government of Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Switzerland, Canada, and Spain will each get 1% of its total value.A Brief Note on F/A-18 and E/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.Boeing’s EA-18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack  platform which operates from either an aircraft carrier or from land bases. The aircraft helps combat electronic attack and suppresses enemy air defences, particularly at the start and at early stages of on-going hostilities. The Growler aircraft has 11 weapon stations for carrying electronic mission systems and weapons and can then be used to carry out conventional strike missions. The major contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) manufactures the rear and centre fuselage sections and is responsible for the manufacture of the structural components.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Its defense segment, known as Boeing Defense, Space & Security (“BDS”), witnessed an approximate 5% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter 2017 revenues to $5.54 billion, driven by higher weapons deliveries. Boeing's backlog at BDS stood at $50 billion, 40% of which comprised orders from international clients. In particular, among other defense equipment, the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been winning a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Inevitably, Boeing has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircrafts and major aerospace programs, including the F-18 and EA-18 aircrafts. This was evidenced by the delivery of the 150th EA-18G Growler to the U.S. Navy along with $10 billion of new orders booked during the last quarter. We believe the latest contract reflects this that Boeing’s jet fighters enjoy in the global market.Meanwhile, last month, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary from the proposed budget, which further includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 81.1 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Huntington Ingalls recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the last four quarters.

170,HII,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently won a delivery order for H-60 spare parts. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 31, 2020.Valued at $84.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. Raytheon will execute the task for this deal at Texas. Fiscal 2018 through 2020 Navy working capital funds will be used to finance the contract.A Brief Note on H-60H-60 is a family of military helicopters, built by Sikorsky — a unit of defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report). Popularly known as Black Hawk, this series of aircraft serve the U.S. military as well as the armed forces of 28 other countries worldwide as a tough, reliable utility helicopter.Over the last 40 years, this aircraft has served in countless combat zones to deliver and extract troops, saved lives as a MEDEVAC or casualty evacuation platform, provided critical supplies to troops, delivered emergency supplies during natural disasters, and performed as an aerial firefighter and border patroller.More than 4,000 Black Hawk aircraft of all types are in service worldwide today. The U.S. Army is the largest operator with 2,135 H-60 designated aircraft.Our ViewWith the increase in cyber-attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability in the past decade, a rapid rise in defense spending has been witnessed among countries worldwide to further strengthen their national security. America is also observing a solid inflow of military contracts lately.With Raytheon being one of the top-notch defense majors in the United States, the company has been winning significant awards from the domestic as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenal portfolio. For instance, the company won a $2.3-billionhybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) weapon systems program, at the end of January 2018. Last week, Raytheon won a modification deal worth $523 million for production of Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile’s (AMRAAM) 31st Lot.Meanwhile the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal aims at spending $12.9 billion for enhancements to U.S. missile defense capabilities. Notably, the budget includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 240 Patriot Missile Segment Enhancements. This in turn surely reflects increased growth prospects for Raytheon and we may expect the company to win more such contracts, like the latest one, from the Pentagon in the coming days.Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 44.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.5%. The company’s growing demand for missile defense systems and expanding overseas business most probably have boosted this outperformance.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) , each of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

171,HII,"With investors puzzled about the future course of stock market momentum given the rising rate worries, investors must be wondering where to park their money. With a spike in yield, chances are high that both equities and bonds will lose their value.Goldman Sachs has already forecast that stocks may nosedive 25% if 10-year bond yields hit a high of 4.5% and a more than 95% probability of a Fed rate hike in March. A senior portfolio manager at Sit predicts that the Fed will raise rates four times this year, one more than what has been penciled so far by the central bank.While rising rates will lower the price of bonds, fears of faster ceases in cheap money inflows will likely hurt stocks. Against this scenario, some safe or value picks are necessary.BofA stock strategist noted that “while we do not see a set level at which interest rates have begun to hurt equities, we may be getting closer to exiting the “sweet spot.” The strategist also indicated that “historically, the probability of loss for the S&P 500 increases when the 10-year Treasury yield rises above 3%.”With the benchmark Treasury yield hitting a high of 2.94% this month and currently at 2.86% as on Feb 26, 2018, a 3%-yield is not a far behind. So, let’s find what could be safer stock investing options right now.Target Dividend AristocratsDividend-paying securities can be steady sources of current income for investors when returns from equity markets are at risk. But as per the analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, both high-yield and no-yield can get hurt in a rising rate environment (read: Earn 5% Plus Yield With These ETFs).So, it is better to tap “companies with modest yields and plenty of potential to grow their payments. Typically, dividend growers trade at a 20% premium to high yielders, but right now the growers are slightly cheaper,” per Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Dividend aristocrats are the blue-chip dividend-paying companies, which have a long history of raising dividend payments year over year. These provide hedge against economic uncertainty and are high-quality in nature.Further, many U.S. companies hoard a pile cash on their balance sheets and are likely to increase their dividend payouts, especially given the passing of the tax reform. The Trump administration proposed a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system, allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes.Investors are expecting tax savings to result in fatter and faster dividend hikes and more stock buybacks. Morgan Stanley’s analysts predict that 43% of the total tax savings will go to dividends and buybacks (read: How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback and Dividend ETFs?).ETF Picks Below we highlight four ETFs that comprise stocks with a long history of increasing dividends (read: 5 Overlooked Smart Beta Dividend ETFs Worth Buying Now).Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)The underlying NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index consists of common stocks of companies that have a record of increasing dividends over time.

172,HII,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%)greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the designing, building, overhauling and repairing of ships, has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years with a VGM Score of B. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.

173,HII,"Although inflation fears and the resultant faster-than-expected rates hike have been playing foul in the stock market, the long-term fundamentals remain intact given solid corporate earnings and accelerating global economic growth.The euphoria surrounding the tax reform has been the biggest catalyst this year, as it will perk up the economy and save billions for corporations, leading to reflation trade and an earnings boost. Further, increased consumer spending, rising consumer confidence, 17-year low unemployment, and a pickup in average hourly earnings are bolstering confidence in the economy and the nine-year bull market (read: 4 ETFs at the Heart of the Market Rebound).However, volatility will continue to block the bulls going ahead this year given stretched valuations, geopolitical tension, and Washington turmoil. Additionally, higher rates will lead to a rise in borrowing costs, thereby hurting economic growth.Against such a backdrop, investors could be well served by looking at the ETFs and stocks of the top-ranked sectors.How to Find the Top-Performing SectorsWhile identifying the top-performing sector is a daunting task, the Zacks Industry Rank makes this process simpler. The Zacks Industry Rank is determined by calculating the average Zacks Rank for each stock in the industry and then assigning a rank to it. First, we selected the best industries that have a top Zacks Rank.A top Zacks Industry Rank means that more stocks within that group are seeing upward earnings estimate revisions. Since an industry is a group of stocks in a similar business, this is the perfect way to size it up (read: all the Top Ranked ETFs).The Zacks Industry classification divides the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 medium or M-level industries and 260 plus or X-level industries. We rank all 260 plus X-level industries based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).The top 132 Zacks Ranked industries would be in the top 50% of all X-level industries, whereas the bottom 133 Zacks Ranked industries would be in the bottom 50%.ConstructionAbout 80% of the industries under this sector are top-ranked with homebuilders (top 5%) and wood (top 9%) leading the way higher, followed by miscellaneous (top 12%), paints and related products (top 14%), and concrete and aggregates (top 20%). While tight supply, rising prices, and higher mortgage rates might lose appeal for the homebuilding segment, solid labor market fundamentals along with rising wages will continue to fuel growth. Builders are also optimistic about the outlook, suggesting that strong demand for homes in the months ahead (read: Solid Data Drives Housing Stocks and ETFs Higher).SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report): The most popular choice in the homebuilding space, XHB, follows the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index. In total, the fund holds about 34 securities in its basket with each accounting for less than 5.41% share. It has amassed $955.8 million in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of around 1.8 million shares. The product charges 35 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #1 company builds an array of luxury residential single-family detached, attached home, master planned resort-style golf, and urban low-, mid-, and high-rise communities. It saw positive earnings estimate revisions by 24 cents for this fiscal year in the past 30 days, and has an expected growth rate of 28.71%. The stock has a VGM Score of A.RetailThe retail sector is flourishing this year thanks to a massive $1.5-trillion tax cut, which will provide consumers with extra cash that will lead to higher discretionary spending. Additionally, retailers, especially departmental stores are the biggest beneficiaries of the tax cut plan as they pay maximum taxes among S&P 500 companies given their large domestic networks. As such, automotive retailer and regional departmental stores boast a top industry rank and are expected to outperform, followed by  consumer electronic (top 2%), miscellaneous (top 5%) and discount stores (top 9%).  PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio (PMR  -  Free Report): This fund follows the Dynamic Retail Intellidex Index, which measures the performance of companies engaged in operating general merchandise stores such as department stores, discount stores, warehouse clubs and superstores; specialty stores, including apparel, electronics, accessories and footwear stores; and home improvement and home furnishings stores. In total, the product holds 30 securities with none accounting for more than 6.01% of assets. PMR is the unpopular and illiquid option in the retail space having AUM of just $11.2 million and average trading volume of 2,000 shares. It charges 63 bps in fees per year and carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (read: 4 ETFs Set to Surge in Q4 Earnings).Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 company operates as a retailer of branded apparel products in the United States, offering fashion-focused merchandise, including ladies sportswear, menswear, youth apparel, baby furniture, footwear, accessories, home décor and gifts, and coats. It saw positive earnings estimate revision of four cents for this fiscal year in the past one month, with an expected growth rate of 19.83%.

174,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Missiles and Fire Control (“MFC”), recently secured a modification contract for manufacturing additional missile round pallets, spare parts and support equipments for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (“THAAD”) system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by April 30, 2021.Details of the DealValued at $53.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. Operations related to the contract will be carried out in Dallas and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Huntsville, AL; and Sunnyvale, CA.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 procurement funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on THAADTHAAD system is an anti-missile system that uses a hit-to-kill approach to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. It is the only missile defense system with the operational flexibility to intercept both within and outside the Earth’s atmospheres for providing versatile capability to the war fighter.Impressively, the system has a track record of 100% mission success in flight testing since 2005.Our ViewBeing Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Department of Defense each year and 2018 has been no exception. A week back, the company won a $522-million contract for producing Trident II (D5) missiles. In the previous month, Lockheed Martin secured a $524-million PAC-3 Missiles deal. Toward the end of January 2018, it clinched $459-million deal for the production and delivery of interceptors for the THAAD weapon system.Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment, which recorded sales of $2.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, reflected a year-over-year improvement of 31%. The aforementioned contract wins, along with the latest one, will significantly boost this segment’s growth and we may expect its first-quarter 2018 results to reflect similar top-line improvement.  Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, is expected to gain significantly from this provision, which it includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 82 THAAD missiles and $1.7 billion for the procurement of 43 AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense systems.Further, global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Such projections reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the coming days.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 28.7% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

175,HII,"“Don't spend more than you take in. Control your debt.” – Gary HerbertDebt financing – a well know business strategy in the corporate finance space – refers to borrowing of money, mostly by selling debt instruments to individuals or institutional investors. Per the theory of cost of capital, a company’s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance its capital projects. Now a comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper, especially in periods of low interest rates.Moreover, when a company opts for equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company’s future profits as well. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt is something that everyone likes to avoid. This is because debt financing means borrowing against future earnings, which simply means that instead of using all future profits to grow the business, one has to allocate a portion for repayments.In fact, given the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States in favor of interest rate hikes, the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowers. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee began lifting rates from near zero in December 2015. While long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards, a material rise in long-term interest rates is a key risk for capital intensive stocks, in particular those which rely heavily on capital markets for access to fundsTherefore, for an investor, the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he/she is investing has a sustainable debt level, since only a small number of companies can avoid taking debt for their business growth.Considering this and the fact that companies with high debt loads are more prone to bankruptcy at times of crisis, the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently and particularly target low leverage stocks.This is where the concept of “leverage” comes in. Leverage simply indicates the level of debt a corporation carries at present. Several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments. The most popular among them is debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.With the Q1 earnings season set to gather steam from next week, investors must be eyeing stocks that have historically exhibited solid earnings growth.But in the uncertain world of investment, markets can falter anytime, particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage. Therefore, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 24 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report): The company manufactures building materials and engineered wood products in the United States, Canada, Chile and Brazil. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.18% in the trailing four quarters and sports a Zacks Rank #1.DMC Global (BOOM  -  Free Report): It is a diversified technology company.

176,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) Ingalls Shipbuilding unit recently secured a modification contract for carrying out emergent repair and restoration of USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62). The contract also provisions the company to provide additional collision repair, maintenance and modernization services to USS Fitzgerald.The deal, valued at $77.6 million, has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to the contract will be carried out in Pascagoula, MS and is scheduled to be over by January 2020. Huntington Ingalls will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the task.USS FitzgeraldUSS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) is a guided missile destroyer battleship of the Arleigh Burke class of surface ships, currently serving the U.S. Navy. While DD represents the basic destroyers per US Navy classifications, G stands for its guided missile armament design. It is built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multifunction passive electronically scanned array radar.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. More than 70% of the active Navy fleet comprises ships from this company. Its Ingalls Shipbuilding unit is the largest supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants, and has built nearly 70% of the U.S. Navy fleet of warships.Coming to recent developments in this unit, the company added some value additions to their product repertoire in the fourth quarter of 2017. It laid the foundation for LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale, DDG 123 and DDG 119 missile destroyer alongside delivering DDG 114 Ralph Johnson and launching the NSC 8 Midgett. Such development positions the company well ahead of its peers in terms of acquiring major shipbuilding contracts.However, the Ingalls division witnessed a marginal dip of 0.5% in fourth-quarter revenues from the year-ago period. Currently, the company is maximizing efforts to improve revenues from the Legend-class National Security Cutter  and surface combatant programs. The latest contract win is expected to provide impetus to the division’s growth.Recently, President Trump proposed the fiscal 2019 budget that strongly emphasized on rebuilding the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and geared up Joint Force. The proposed budget’s major war fighting investments included spending plans of $18.3 billion on shipbuilding and increasing the end strength for the Navy Force. Such planned initiatives, if approved by the Senate, will open doors for shipbuilding giants like Huntington Ingalls to acquire more contracts, which in turn will boost its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied about 22.1% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 48.4%. The underperformance might have been owing to the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Heico Corporation (HEI  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems (SPR  -  Free Report), each of them flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose by 9.5% to $2.08 in the last 90 days.Spirit Aerosystems posted an average positive earnings surprise of 9.76% for the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose by 15% to $6.30 in the last 90 days.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

177,HII,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) board of directors approved a 10.7% hike in quarterly common stock dividend. This takes the annualized payout to $3.72 per share.Dividend HikeThe company will pay a dividend of 93 cents per share compared with the prior payment of 84 cents. The hiked dividend will be paid on May11 to shareholders on record as of Apr 13.Raising dividend annually has been a regular practice for this defense major. The latest hike marks the 21st consecutive annual dividend hike.The current annualized dividend yield is 1.64% compared with the industry average of 0.89%. The increase in distributable income indicates the company’s profitably implemented investment growth strategy.General Dynamic’s FinancialsGeneral Dynamics strives to maintain a flexible liquidity position. As of Dec 31, 2017, General Dynamics’ cash and cash equivalents were $2,983 million, up 27.8% year over year. In 2017, the company’s cash inflow from operating activities was around $3,879 million, up 76.5%. Free cash inflow from operations in 2017 was $3,451 million, up 91.1%.We believe strong performance of its diverse defense offerings has given General Dynamics the financial flexibility to pay incremental dividends. Undoubtedly, this will attract more investors to spend money inthe company’s shares.Moreover, last month the company acquired CSRA — a premier provider of high-tech IT solutions for $9.6 billion. With increasing demand for cybersecurity solution across the globe, this has been a significant step adopted by General Dynamics to enhance its footprint in the cybersecurity market.This buyout enables General Dynamics to offer cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies which in turn will push up its profit margin.We believe that the company’s strong cash flow and organic growth, along with its inorganic strategies like the CSRA purchase will help generate sufficient funds to meet its financial commitments, apart from awarding shareholders through lucrative dividend payouts.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics’s stock has rallied about 13.4% in the last three months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 15.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the 2017 Tax Cuts and JobsAct that had an adverse impact on the company's financials. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing Co.

178,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens.While the company’s stable financial position is expected to drive fourth-quarter results, doubt remains whether its Newport News segment will continue to remain on a growth trajectory.Last quarter, this military shipbuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.63%.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Stable Financials – A Key CatalystA stable financial position backed by a strong cash generation capacity enables Huntington Ingalls to follow a disciplined capital spending program. In addition, the company focuses on maximizing shareholder value, through both share repurchases and increased dividend payouts. In November 2017, the company raised quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share, up 20% from the previous payout. Management, along with the dividend hike, increased the company’s share repurchase program from $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion. During the first nine months of 2017, Huntington Ingalls repurchased common stock worth $152 million. These moves show the company’s confidence in consistent free cash flow generation.Notably, the company’s net cash from operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2017 was $380 million, while its free cash flow was $5 million. Considering, the dividend hike as well as raised share repurchase program announced by management during the fourth quarter, we expect the company’s upcoming results to show similar solid financial stability as well.Will Newport News Segment Continue to Tread on Growth Path? Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last few years. Interestingly, in the third quarter, this segment’s top line rebounded and registered year-over-year growth of 7.7%. However, as per management, the macro trend at Newport News is that it is on the front end of a bunch of new programs across all its product lines. The team is currently engaged in the transition on its aircraft carrier and submarines programs. So there remains a cause of concern because it may take time for demand to wind up for these new programs, which in turn may dent the segment’s top line in the near term. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate of revenues for Newport News unit stands at $1,053 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an annual decline of 5.9%.Dearth of Order in Q4: A Killjoy? A steady inflow of orders from Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls’ results. However, in the fourth quarter the company did not win any notable contract. Nevertheless, considering solid contributions from Camber acquisition along with robust sales volume, overall sales growth for Huntington Ingalls’ fourth quarter remains positive. Notably, our consensus estimate for revenues is estimated at $2.01 billion, implying a 4.3% year-over-year increase.Moreover, the corporate-friendly tax reform adopted by the U.S. government will most likely boost the company’s earnings that will get reflected in the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

179,HII,"President Trump signed into law a bipartisan budget deal that will keep the government funded for two years and eliminate the constant fear of shutdowns. Senate Republicans and Democrats agreed to provide a massive boost to spending levels for Pentagon and domestic programs, including infrastructure. Trump has already urged for an uptick in defense spending to build nuclear arsenal, while raised concerns over the nation’s “crumbling infrastructure”.As outlays are expected to increase for defense and infrastructure programs, it seems wise to invest in such areas for healthy returns.The 2-Year PactTrump deal was signed on Feb 9, following the approval of the budget bill in Congress. The spending pact suspends a 2011 budget law that had set hard caps on discretionary outlays and was backed by Conservatives.Fiscal conservative Rand Paul, R-Ky delayed the vote in the Senate resulting in a partial government shutdown. Nonetheless, the Senate passed the measure 71-28 and the shutdown was averted. The bill also faced opposition from conservatives in the House. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tried to delay the vote in the House. But, the House eventually passed the measure 240-186.The Bipartisan Budget Act accomplished a few long-awaited priorities. U.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion for the next two years to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years.Congress has time and again voted to raise budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was signed in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Details on the DealThe spending pact will raise defense budget by $165 billion over two years. While spending caps will be lifted by $80 billion in the current fiscal, $85 billion will be hiked next year. This in turn will help the military receive a minimum of $1.4 trillion through September 2019 to help buy fighter jets, ships and other equipment. This level of funding is also expected to improve the country’s missiles and nuclear bombers.The bipartisan deal is a major victory for military hawks. After all, Republicans had to battle fiscal conservatives in their own party for years to lift restrictions on defense outlays. Moreover, defense spending was raised in 2010 last. Since then, military commanders faced strict restriction on annual defense spending by the Budget Control Act, a 2011 deal reached by then-President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans.The budget deal, in the meantime, will boost domestic spending by hundreds of billions of dollars. Nondefense spending caps will be raised by $63 billion in the current fiscal, while $68 billion will be increased next year. Out of such spending, a large chunk will be used for infrastructural programs. About $20 billion will be used for infrastructure programs such as surface transportation, rural water, wastewater systems, to name a few, over the two years.Trump Calls for Higher Defense, Infrastructure OutlaysTrump has already called on Congress to put an end to caps on defense spending so that the United States can modernize its nuclear arsenal. He said that better nuclear weapons are required to counter rogue organizations, terror outfits and countries such as China and Russia.After signing the budget pact, Trump tweeted “military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!”Trump has also urged for huge infrastructure spending. He wants to rebuild infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and railways. This is something that he has been promising since his campaign days. He wants the Congress to pass a legislation to stimulate a minimum of $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure outlays. He wants the approval process to reduce to two years if not one.5 Top GainersThe two-year budget deal will provide a significant boost to spending levels for both defense and nondefense programs like infrastructure.

180,HII,"FLIR Systems Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 14.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%. FLIR Systems has an average positive surprise of 1.3% in the trailing four quarters.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +0.36%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsOver the past few quarters, FLIR Systems’ diverse business portfolio (in terms of geographies, products and markets) has remained a staple growth driver. Further, the company’s restructuring efforts in the past five years have helped it reap synergies and drive profitable growth, combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions. Solid execution along with streamlined business is helping the company drive solid improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, operating margin and net income. Going forward, we believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels will help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth.Moreover, the company remains strongly committed toward introduction of innovative products to expand its customer base and enhance foothold in new markets. For instance, since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the last reported quarter, including, three thermal imaging-equipped test and measurement products, Lepton microcamera thermal core, Infrared Guided Measurement and FLIR FB-Series are anticipated to bolster sales for the upcoming quarter. This apart, the company’s diligent CDMQ model is expected to boost the sales of its government as well as military business.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Surveillance segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $166 million compared with third-quarter revenues of $147 million. Revenues from Instruments segment are also anticipated to be high with estimate of $103 million compared with reported revenues of $91 million in the prior quarter. The company’s acquired businesses, including Point Grey, Armasight and Prox Dynamics are expected to contribute to fiscal fourth-quarter sales as well.However the fact remains that, poor economic conditions across the company’s key operating regions may hamper capital investment and consumer spending, consequently weighing on its profitability. Also, the company’s business remains prone to political uncertainty and currency volatility globally, adding to concerns.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Churchill Downs, Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.03% and a Zacks Rank #1.

181,HII,"Embraer S.A. (ERJ  -  Free Report) recently reported its delivery figures for the first quarter of 2018. Total number of jets delivered in the reported quarter was 25, marking a decline of 24.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 33 jets.Q1 Deliveries & BacklogEmbraer delivered a total of 14 jets in the first quarter 2018, in the commercial aviation market, compared to 18 jets delivered in the prior-year’s first quarter.In the business aviation market, a total of 11 aircraft were delivered in the first quarter, which was respectively segregated into eight light jets and three large jets. In the first quarter of 2017, deliveries to the executive aviation market included 11 light and four large executive jets, amounting to a total of 15 jets.On a year-over-year basis, commercial deliveries dropped 22.2%, while executive aviation deliveries fell 26.7%.Embraer’s first-quarter backlog was pegged at 421 aircraft, which comprised 106 195-E2s, 100 175-E2s, 92 E175s, 74 190-E2s, 43 E190s, five E195s and one E170 jets. This compares unfavorably with the company’s fourth-quarter backlog of 435 jets.Recent DevelopmentsThe company has been awarded the triple certification for the E190-E2 commercial aircraft from the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency (Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil – ANAC), the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency). This event turned out to be the main highlight for Embraer in the first quarter of 2018.Major flight test results were also announced by the company in the reported quarter confirming the E2 jet as the most efficient environment friendly single-aisle aircraft in the market, in terms of fuel consumption and takeoff performance.The company also delivered its first new Phenom 300E business jet after receiving certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency.What’s Ahead for Embraer?Embraer expects total market deliveries of 6,400-2,300 jets at the 70-90 seat segment and 4,100 units at the 90-130 seat segment by 2035. The 70-130 seat worldwide fleet in service is anticipated to increase from 2,670 jets in 2015 to 6,690 by 2035, making it the fastest growing segment.On the other hand, Boeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) latest market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major demand driver, accounting for 72% of the total projection along with widebody jets, comprising over 20%. Further, the commercial passenger traffic is also expected to grow 4.7% annually.As a result of such improved projections on commercial jets, we expect Embraer’s commercial fleet to receive a boost in the upcoming quarterly results, based on steady inflow of orders and solid demandexpectations.Price MovementShares of Embraer have gained 31.0% over a year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 47.3%. The underperformance might have been led by the stiff competition that the company faces in the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry dominated by aerospace giants — Boeing and Airbus SE. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEmbraer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

182,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business segment recently secured a modification contract to exerc ise options for Trident II (D5) missile production and for providing associated system support for deployment. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $522.3 million, the contract has been awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, DC.Majority of the work for this agreement will be executed in Magna, Utah and Sunnyvale, CA. The remaining part will be carried out in Cape Canaveral, FL; Pittsfield, MA and in various other regions across the United States.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 weapons procurement (Navy), fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds, and fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds might also be utilized to partially finance the deal, subject to availability.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and BritishVANGUARD-class submarines.Markedly, these missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. Notably, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile is a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.Along with the United States and other powerful nations, developing countries across the globe are also revamping their missile strength due to the increasing geopolitical conflicts, war, and terrorism. As a result of this, the global rocket and missile market, which also includes fleet ballistic missiles, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Such projects reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the years to come.In February 2018, the $716-billion proposal made by President Trump for the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill is surely anticipated to boost the overall defense industry. In particular, this budget provisions for an investment of approximately $6 billion in the United States’ missile defense program. We believe the latest contract won by Lockheed Martin is a reflection of the fact that the United States is rapidly expanding its missile strength and given the budget’s allocation for missile programs, the company will win more such deals in the days ahead.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 23.3% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report).

184,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) received orders from Hawaiian Airlines, a business unit of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) for 10 787 Dreamliners. The cost of 787-9 planes per list price is $2.82 billion. The order size might increase as Hawaiian Airlines has the right to purchase another 10 787 aeroplane.Hawaiian Airlines has opted for the fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliner as its flagship airplane for medium to long-haul flights.787 DreamlinerBoeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner is one of the latest models of the company’s super-efficient 787 jets, offering more seats and cargo capability than its previous versions. With the fuselage stretched by 6 meters (20 feet) over the 787-8 model, the 787-9 comes with 20% less fuel use and 20% lower emission than other aircraft of similar size.Leveraging the visionary design of the 787-8, the 787-9 jet promises to offer passenger-pleasing features such as large windows, large stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride.BacklogBacklog at the end of 2017 was up to $488.1 billion from $473.5 billion at the end of 2016-end. Reported backlog included $40 billion of net orders during 2017.Due to the high credentials of Boeing’s products, customers are willing to wait for long periods for its jets. Bigger PictureIn June 2017, Boeing raised its 20-year forecast for jetliner demand by 3.6%. Per the current outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. Notably, while single- aisle jets are expected to be the major demand driver, their twin-aisle counterparts are also likely to gain solid traction.In this context, Boeing projects demand for new twin-aisle planes in the 2017-2036 period to be 9,130. The company estimates that the total value of all wide-body planes (comprising small, medium and large) sold over the period will be $2.8 trillion compared with $3.2 trillion for the narrow-body variety.Thus, prospects for twin-aisle jet planes seems impressive, with more airlines shifting to small and medium/large wide-body airplanes like Boeing’s 787 fleets. The company’s latest deal with Hawaiian Airlines is one such example.Also, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s Commercial Airplane Segment, that includes the 787 airplanes, saw an 8% rise in revenues to $15.47 billion. Boeing remains focused on improving 787 cash generation driven by favorable delivery mix, supplier step down pricing and efforts to drive internal productivity and first-time quality.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 91.7 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft.  Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks    Boeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other-top ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems (SPR  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

185,HII,"Northrop Grumman’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Aerospace Systems business recently clinched a $429-million contract for two Extremely High Frequency Data Rate (EHF XDR) payloads. These high-frequency payloads will be used for the recapitalization of the Enhanced Polar System (EPS) and to support military satellite communications mission in the polar region.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Space and Missile Systems Center, Military Satellite Communications Directorate, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Redondo Beach, CA.Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 research and development funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be complete by December 2022.A Brief Note on EHF XDR PayloadsThe advanced EHF system provides joint, interoperable, assured connectivity for war fighters in all military operations levels. It is the nation’s next-generation military strategic and tactical relay system. Its satellite- based EHF communications payloads provide advanced communications terminals, a gateway to connect with the Global Information Grid and other communication systems.The EHF payload delivers XDR (Extreme Data Rate) communications services, providing data rates up to 8.192 Mbps per user. This helps Air Force system operators to rapidly establish and reconfigurenetworks to meet dynamic command and control requirements.Our ViewIn the past couple of years, frequent cyber-attacks, following the one in May 2017 with more than 45,000 attacks, has been affecting various nations. We believe that Northrop Grumman has significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR), unmanned systems as well as cyber security. Naturally, more inflow of contracts for equipment related to cyber security have been coming from the Pentagon.However, lower volumes at the EHF program have been hampering growth of Northrop Grumman’s Space sub-segment, which develops EHF systems and payload. With these payloads providing survivable, protected communications to U.S. forces, we may expect more contract wins, which in turn will substantially boost the Space sub-segment’s performance.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 38% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 40.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by intense competition in domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

186,HII,"When it comes to choosing stocks, investors often opt for complex investment strategies in a bid to book higher returns. But with ever changing market dynamics, this may not yield the desired results every time. Therefore, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to choose stocks is always a wise decision.One such strategy is sales growth. Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house, as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making.So, when companies incur losses for a temporary period, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Also, in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters.Additionally, profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio. Hence, P/S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation. Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not enough.A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

187,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently clinched a modification contract for procuring long lead parts associated with the manufacture of 19 P-8A aircraft of the 10th Lot. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by March 2022.Details of the DealValued at $282.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the deal, 10 of the 19 jets will be delivered to the U.S. Navy, five to the government of Norway and four to the U.K. administration.Majority of the work will be executed in Seattle, WA and the rest at Cambridge, U.K. and various other locations across the United States. Notably, the deal includes 49.7% of the work for the U.S. Navy, 28.7% for the government of Norway and 21.6% for the U.K.Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds will be utilized to complete the task.About P-8A AircraftBoeing’s P-8A Multi-mission Maritime aircraft, also known as Poseidon, is used for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and intelligence as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is also capable of broad-area littoral operations.A derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, the P-8A and its variant for India, the P-8I, delivers superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability in the future battle space.Our ViewBeing one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s defense segment stands out among peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Of late, it has also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon.During 2017, the defense segment had backlog worth $50 billion, further reflecting the slew of orders that Boeing enjoys for its varied weaponries. Going ahead, similar backlog figures can be expected at this segment, buoyed by contract wins like the latest one.Considering the fiscal 2019 defense budget worth $716 billion, proposed by President Trump last month, we expect Boeing to win more contracts from the Pentagon on solid demand for its military aircraft.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing's shares have surged about 93.8% compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with long-term robust demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

188,HII,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) subsidiary unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a contract with a maximum ceiling value worth $475 million from the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. Work related to this deal will involve development, integration, testing and fielding of complex advanced discrimination techniques and sustainment of complex modeling and simulation techniques and tools used to model Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (“BMDS”) capabilities.Details of the DealPer the deal, the company will develop advanced discrimination algorithms for the first time along with some highly complex software and tests. The entire contract has been divided into two task orders wherein approximately $9.9 million will be used for program management and another $143 million for the development of BMDS.The work will be carried out in Huntsville, AL; Colorado Springs, CO; Boulder, CO; and Azusa, CA. Ordering period for the deal is from Mar 2, 2018 through Mar 2, 2023.  Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to complete the task.Northrop’s Role in BMDSOf late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour. A well- equipped nation like the United States will thus always want to remain prepared for sudden attacks.Realizing the rapidly expanding market for missile defense, major players like Northrop Grumman in the aerospace-defense space are increasing their focus on developing state-of-the-art missiles. In sync with this, Northrop Grumman’s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile-Minuteman-III holds immense importance, which was first deployed in 1970. Today, various modernization programs have extended this weapon’s operational life beyond 2030.Along with United States, other powerful nations across the globe are also expanding their missile strength. As a result of this, the global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (per Markets and Markets research firm).In fact to make most from the current situation, Northrop Grumman announced last September that it has settled the deal for acquisition of missile-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. With this buyout, Northrop Grumman will benefit from the Orbital ATK's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.Further, in February 2018, the $716-billion proposal made by President Trump for the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill is anticipated to boost the defense industry. We believe this budget scenario in the United States as well as the growth prospect for the global missile market, along with frequent contract wins like the latest one, will enable Northrop Grumman to remain one of the major defense players in the market.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 42% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

189,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a foreign military sales (“FMS”) contract worth $481.2 million to support the construction of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (“MMSC”) ships. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by October 2024.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Walpole, MA; Washington, D.C., Moorestown, NJ, Germany and a few other locations. The agreement will cater to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.A Brief Note on MMSC Lockheed Martin’s MMSC is a derivative of the US Navy’s Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship (“LCS”). It is a lethal and highly-maneuverable surface combatant that performs littoral and open-ocean operations.With proven combat management system lineage, Lockheed Martin’s MMSC has the interoperability necessary for today’s joint and allied naval force maneuvers. Paired with world’s most advanced maritime helicopter, MH-60R SEAHAWK, the MMSC has a robust anti-submarine mission capability that is fully interoperable with the U.S. Navy and its coalition partners.Our ViewApart from being Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin is also the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s latest LCS. With President Trump in favor of spending heavily in the nation’s defense arena, his reign is considered to be a golden era for aerospace-defense players like Lockheed Martin.This gets very well reflected in the fiscal 2019 (FY2019) defense budget that was released last month. For the Naval section, the FY 2019 budget provisions for procurement of one LCS for $1.3 billion. This in turn will boost Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment that designs, manufactures, serves and supports a variety of defense products like the LCS.During fourth-quarter 2017, RMS segment registered 14% top-line growth. We may expect this business unit to show similar upward sales trend in the first quarter and beyond, buoyed by the latest contract that the company won along with the recent budgetary amendments.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock moved up about 27.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. This underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report).

190,HII,"The Q4 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with more than 75% of S&P 500’s total market capitalization having released their quarterly results.

191,HII,"It has been a crazy week for domestic and global markets, with massive volatility and somewhat historic sell-offs leading to big losses across the S&P 500 and the Dow. This retreat has prompted many investors to move much more cautiously after a sustained period of sky-high climbs.Strangely enough, this market downturn also arrived during a fourth-quarter earnings season that saw strong results across the board. With that said, one of the best ways to beat this correction is to look for stocks that have not yet reported and are expected to beat quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.Generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it often means that they have brand new information that might be more accurate than what analysts previously thought just a couple of months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a very special treat: a free look at three of the strongest stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now.

192,HII,"The Dow emerged from four straight sessions of losses to finish in the green on Monday. The ascent was largely attributable to a reduction in fears triggered off by President Trump’s recent tariff announcements. Key members of his administration remained evasive over the likelihood of such plans actually reaching fruition. Additionally, leading Republicans strongly voiced their opposition to such a move.Meanwhile, a section of analysts have questioned whether such tariffs will actually come into force. They have repeatedly pointed at Trump’s own tweets on the issue, where he more or less indicates that this could merely be a bargaining tactic to gain leverage ahead of future NAFTA negotiations.Also, Trump has been extremely sensitive to market movements, taking credit for equity gains on more than one occasion. This is why he is also likely to take further market losses caused by his remarks into account before taking the final call on the issue. Taking these factors into account, stocks could soon begin racking up steady gains. This is why it makes sense to pick up great value stocks while the situation remains volatile.GOP Leaders Critical of Tariffs, White House EvasiveHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was among the leading GOP leader to voice his resentment on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan said the Speaker was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war.” Strong added that Ryan was “urging the White House to not advance with this plan” since it could “jeopardize” the economic benefits reaped from recent tax cuts.Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross remained largely evasive when questioned during a television interview as to whether Trump would actually go ahead with the proposed tariffs. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also provided inconsistent responses on the issue, giving the impression that the tariffs were far from a done deal.Tariffs Only a Negotiating Tactic?The President himself indicated that the decision to actually go ahead with the tariffs was contingent on the amount of headway made on NAFTA negotiations. Trump suggested that fresh terms from Mexico and Canada could exempt these countries from the import taxes. On Monday, the President tweeted that “Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.""A significant section of analysts also felt that the trade tariff impasse could end with a diplomatic solution. They pointed toward the fact that Caterpillar (CAT) and Harley-Davidson (HOG) gained 3.2% and 2.3% on Monday. Both these stocks are expected to be hugely be impacted by these import taxes. Traders also felt that Trump’s NAFTA related comments showed that he was ready to adopt a flexible approach.Targeted, Muted Response LikelyOver the weekend, Trump had argued that trade wars may actually be good for the U.S. economy. But on Monday he changed tack, saying: “I don’t think we’ll have a trade war.” Trump’s rationale throughout this episode has been that the United States is too large a market to ignore or rile up beyond a certain point. And given the initial response of the countries likely to be most affected by his tariffs, this seems to be largely true as of now.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump on Monday to say that tariffs could only impede NAFTA stocks further. Canada and Mexico have threatened to retaliate, but only in a targeted fashion.Meanwhile, the EU has said that it will impose tariffs on classic American products such as bourbon, jeans and Harley motorcycle, but doesn’t seem keen on further measures at this point. China has asked Trump to be cautious on the issue but has stopped short of specific trade-related measures.Our ChoicesTrump’s NAFTA related comments show that the President is yet to make up his mind on tariff related announcements. Meanwhile, though Trump has received some bipartisan support on the issue, the GOP remains largely opposed to the idea. More importantly, countries that will be severely impacted by such tariffs have largely issued a targeted and muted response.These developments suggest that fears surrounding a tariff war may be largely overstated. Hence it makes sense to buy value stocks in the interim that that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes in earnest.

195,HII,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 29 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the designing, building, overhauling and repairing of ships, has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years with a VGM Score of A.

196,HII,"General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) recently entered into a bidding war with CACI International for acquiring IT service provider CSRA Inc. . While General Dynamics offered last month $9.6 billion, including a $2.8 billion of debt, for the CSRA buyout, CACI proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover.What’s CACI offering?Apparently CACI’s offering seems to be more profitable for CSRA’s shareholders, with the company offering $44 per share of CSRA compared with the General Dynamics proposal of $40.75 a share. This indicates that CACI’s offer will give investors an 8% premium over General Dynamics’ bid.General Dynamics vs. CACI: Who’s the Favorite?In spite of the unsolicited offer that CACI made to acquire CSRA, General Dynamics remains confident of the deal and plans to proceed with its tender offer to acquire CSRA’s all outstanding shares. Notably, the tender offer for CSRA shares has commenced on Mar 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on Apr 2. With General Dynamics having secured the necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction, the chance of CACI snatching the deal from this shipbuilder is highly unlikely.Moreover, General Dynamics believes that CACI’S offer overstates the real value to the CSRA shareholders and understates the involved risk. The company is also of the opinion that CACI's proposal would burden the CSRA with approximately $6.8 billion of debt, once acquired.Another implication of the deal is time value of money for investors as CACI would close the acquisition formalities by July 31, 2018. This means that if CACI wins the bid for CSRA, investors will incur significant opportunity cost due to the four months lag, whereas General Dynamics aims to complete the transaction by early April.Also, the real value of CACI’s stock tends to remain uncertain due to the market risks associated with the CACI transaction closing four months in the future with more than 65% of its stock consisting a fixed exchange ratio.Our ViewPer a report published by Forrester, global purchases of technology software and services by businesses and governments will grow by 4% and software and tech consulting services by 6% in 2018. Such increasing demand of technology services on a global scale will encourage businesses and governments to be more aggressive in their tech spending plans and companies like General Dynamics with their big customer base, through CSRA’s takeover will benefit hugely.General Dynamics’s Information Systems and Technology unit posted revenues of $2.49 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 9.5% year over year. Subsequently, the company believes that CSRA’S acquisition will open doors for it to become a premier provider of high-tech IT solutions to the Government Technology Services market that will in turn boost this unit’s revenues.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has returned about 16% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), each of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

197,HII,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for providing staffing and training services to support the Qatar Patriot Air Defense Missile Systems.Valued at $150.4 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, AL. Raytheon will utilize fiscal 2018 foreign military sales funds to complete the task.Work related to the deal will be performed in Doha, Qatar and is scheduled to be completed by Mar 15, 2018.Patriot Air Defense SystemPatriot is a long-range, high-altitude and all-weather missile defense system. It consists of radars, command-and-control technology and multiple types of interceptors. The system helps to detect, identify and counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aircraft and other threats.Raytheon has consistently remained focused on upgrading this defense system to keep pace with the changing dynamics of modern warfare. This must have enabled the Patriot system to become the foundation of integrated air and missile defense for 14 nations.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Increasing geopolitical tensions across the globe prompted nations, both developed as well as developing, to strengthen their defense systems. With rapid upgradation in technology, missile defense has emerged as an integral part of the defense strategy for all countries.Being a prominent missile-maker, Raytheon manufactures a variety of missiles. Till date, it has built more than 220 Patriot fire units. Needless to say that Raytheon frequently enjoys a solid inflow of missile contracts from Pentagon and the latest deal proves that. In January 2018, Raytheon clinched a new direct-commercial contract for PATRIOT capabilities, worth more than $1.5 billion along with procuring a $2.3 billion PATRIOT contract in February. In fact, apart from PATRIOT missiles’ strong forte in the domestic market, this defense system has seen a number of international buyers in recent times including Qatar, Korea, Poland and others. In this regard, Sweden is expected to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) in mid-2018, worth approximately $1 billion.Without any doubt, such solid order flow for the system is capable of boosting Raytheon’s top line. The company’s Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) division, including PATRIOT program, recorded fourth- quarter 2017 net sales of $1,553 million, reflecting a 6% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We expect the latest contract to instill further growth in this segment in the days ahead.Currently, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74%, during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Given this huge opportunity for expansion, frequent contract wins from Pentagon for its high-end missiles like Patriot, including the latest one, will allow Raytheon to further enhance its market shares in the aerospace and defense industry.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock improved about 35.7% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 31.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by strong international sales and a robust balance sheet. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems (SPR  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

198,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently clinched a contract for providing Army training aids, devices, simulators and simulations, maintenance, sustainment, operations and support to instrumentation systems and live-fire ranges. Work related to the deal is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2020.Valued at $3.5 billion, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Orlando, FL. Per the terms, work locations and funding to perform the task will be decided with each order.Lockheed’s Training & Simulation SolutionsAs the world’s leading systems integrator, Lockheed Martin delivers comprehensive training and logistics solutions to prepare military personnel for the most complex missions. Its training programs include teaching pilots to fly the world’s most advanced fighter jet, leading a convoy through city streets and preparing medical professionals for providing the best possible patient care, among others.Additionally, to keep the U.S. Army ready for battle, Lockheed Martin provides simulation solutions where training meets reality. In this regard, the company’s Prepar3D is a visual simulation platform that allows users to create training scenarios across aviation, maritime, and ground domains. Users can train anywhere in the virtual world from underwater to sub orbital space.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment provides simulation and training services. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the RMS segment generated net sales of $4.4 billion, representing 28.7% of the company’s total sales and a year-over-year improvement of 14.2%. Now that the company has one the aforementioned multi-billion contract, we may expect this business segment to reflect similar strong performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Meanwhile, last month, President Trump proposed the fiscal 2019 budget that aims at increasing the end strength for the Army, Navy and Air Force by 25,900 compared with the fiscal 2018 budget. Moreover, this is the second full-budget request from the President for initiating the rebuilding process for the U.S. military that Trump has been consistently emphasizing on. The rebuilding process will involve additional investments in near-term readiness, which we believe includes providing vigorous training to the soldiers and offering simulation solutions to make them combat-ready.Being the leading contractor of the Pentagon, Lockheed Martin is likely to be a huge beneficiary of this budget, if approved.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 24.4% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.2%. This underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

199,HII,"Drama continued at the White House on Tuesday after President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a sudden and unexpected move. Tillerson’s dismissal comes after a series of public and private disagreements with the President on several crucial policy matters, notably North Korea. A few other dismissals followed in its wake, signaling that the atmosphere surrounding the Oval Office continues to remain volatile.Trump also announced that he was replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Defense stocks rose following these developments as Pompeo is perceived to be more in line with Trump’s views on crucial policy issues. Tax cuts and a favorable budget deal have already provided significant impetus to the sector, which means this is a good time to add defense stocks to your portfolios.Trump, Tillerson Differed on Key Policy MattersThere have been long running differences between the former ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) CEO and Trump for some time now. Last year, Tillerson publicly distanced himself from Trump’s position on the white supremacist rally at Charlottesville by saying that “the President speaks for himself.”More significantly, Tillerson favored a more conciliatory and diplomatic tone on several key issues such as the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal while Trump favored a more belligerent approach. Tillerson also tried to prevent the President from exiting the Paris climate change agreement and had good relations with other Trump team members, most notably Secretary of Defense James Mattis.Ultimately, his advocacy of a diplomatic solution with North Korea brought things to a tipping point. When Tillerson first said that he wanted to begin a dialogue with North Korea, Trump publicly disagreed with him, tweeting that he was “wasting his time.” When the President finally changed his approach last week and agreed to meet Kim Jong-Un, he did not bother to inform or consult Tillerson on the issue.Pompeo in Sync with Trump, Muscular Approach LikelySeveral defense stocks increased early on Tuesday with Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) gaining 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively by the close. Most analysts feel that this is an outcome of Trump replacing Tillerson, who favored a more diplomatic approach, with Pompeo, who is more in line with the President’s thinking. And his opinion on several issues seems to confirm such a view.For instance, despite the continuing investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 President election, Pompeo has chosen to downplay the impact the Kremlin had on its results.  Like Trump, Pompeo is a firm critic of the Iran Nuclear deal and has called the agreement “disastrous.” While serving as congressman from Kansas, Pompeo opposed Obama’s decision to close down Guantanamo Bay.Pompeo seems to favor a hawkish approach in general and has expressed his support for the restoration of the NSA’s spying protocols. But the timing of his appointment ahead of discussions with North Korea means that Trump desires a team which maintains his hardline on North Korea. Pompeo is therefore likely to keep up the pressure against the Kim Jong Un regime.Our ChoicesTrump’s move to replace Tillerson with Matteo ahead of negotiations with North Korea shows that he intends to maintain his hard-nosed approach on key issues. A similar approach is likely to be witnessed against Iran, which can only result in the escalation of global tensions. Already buoyed by tax cuts and a favorable budget deal, such a scenario can only boost defense stocks further.This is why it makes good sense to pick select defense stocks at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest defense contractors in the United States apart from being a premier jet aircraft manufacturer.

200,HII,"On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled the fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by President Trump, intended at rebuilding the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and geared up Joint Force. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Naturally, the budget presentation sent defense stock rallying higher. Notably, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace and S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) indices rose 7.2% since the revelation of the budget proposal. Highlights of the Budget PlanOf the total, $686.1 billion is being kept as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting a 5% real growth over the initial FY 2018 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Notably, the fiscal 2019 budget raises the end strength for the Army, Navy and Air Force by 25,900 (24,100 in active components and 1,800 in reserve components) over the fiscal 2018 budget. The latest budget’s major war fighting investments include spending plans of $21.7 billion on Aircraft, $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding and $5.8 billion on Ground Systems.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs.The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity. Also, the budget plan targets continued savings from reforms such as defense travel modernization as well as headquarters reduction by 25%.Interestingly, the fiscal 2019 budget is the second full budget request from the President, initiating the rebuilding process for the U.S. military that Trump has been consistently emphasizing on. The rebuilding process will involve additional investments in near-term readiness, thereby providing impetus to the programs that suffered due to years of budget cuts.Stocks in the LimelightDefense stocks in the United States have been on a solid rally since the beginning of 2018, courtesy of the nation’s conflict with Pakistan.

Additionally, restructuring activities undertaken by the company since 2013 have helped it reap synergies and drive profitable growth combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions.

206,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $524-million modification contract for Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles, under the domestic and foreign military sales program. Per the deal, the company will delivery PAC-3 enhancement missiles, reduction initiative missiles and associate ground support equipment to the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Romania.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL and Huntsville, AL.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Jan 31, 2021.A Brief Note on PAC-3 MissilesThe PAC-3 missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.Per Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor has a two-pulse solid rocket motor that boosts altitude and range. The company anticipates that demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.Recent DevelopmentsLockheed Martin’s PAC-3 team achieved several notable milestones in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company was successful in neutralizing four tactical ballistic missile targets that eventually led to the initiation of full-rate production for PAC-3 MSE interceptors.Moreover, Lockheed Martin signed major agreements with the U.S. and Romanian officials. The company won PAC-3 MSE missile orders from the Romanian Army to upgrade its air defense system. Lockheed Martin also received orders worth $900 million for PAC-3 missile production for the United States and allied military forces.Needless to say, such inflow of orders will fuel the top line of Lockheed Martin. Evidently, the company’s Missiles and Fire Control segment, which produces the PAC-3 defense missiles and interceptors, recorded fourth-quarter 2017 net sales of $2.3 billion, reflecting a solid 31% improvement from the year-ago quarter.In December 2017, the U.S. government passed a Continuing Resolution Bill which included an additional $4.7 billion over the prior bill for emergency defense funding. Out of the $4.7 billion, nearly $4 billion was allocated for missile defense needs which also included request for Lockheed Martin’s 50 additional THAAD interceptors and nearly 150 PAC-3 MSE missiles. With widespread geo-political uncertainty still looming across the globe, such funding provisions is likely to keep the company on a growth trajectory.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 34.5% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 46.4% growth. The underperformance was caused by intense competition in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks    Lockheed Martin sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems Holdings (SPR  -  Free Report), each of them flaunting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see thecomplete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boeing delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.69% in the past four quarters.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

207,HII,"Stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning, suggesting that celebrations over the end of the recent sell-off may have been premature. Markets looked prime to bounce back strong from their worst week in two years after Monday’s strong gains, but investors have again been reminded that volatility appears to be back in play.What is most interesting about the recent market volatility is that it comes on the back of a strong earnings season. Critics will point to large disparities between GAAP and non-GAAP results—created by one-time tax reform charges—as a reason to be skeptical, but revenue growth was truly impressive, and guidance was encouraging across the board.We have certainly moved past the busy stretch of Q4 earnings season, but a few marquee reports are still trickling in. Athletic retail giant Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) just announced its latest results this morning, and tech giants like Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) are expected later this week.With that said, one of the best ways for investors to avoid the possibility of continued volatility over the next few trading periods is to target companies that are likely to outperform earnings estimates. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a very special treat: a free look at three of the strongest stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now. Check them out:1.       Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (HCC  -  Free Report)Warrior Met Coal is a producer and exporter of premium metallurgical coal, operating primarily in Alabama. The company is scheduled to release its brand-new quarterly report after the market closes on Feb. 14. HCC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 5.00%.Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect Warrior Met to report earnings of $1.00 per share and total revenues of $227.72 million. The stock’s Most Accurate Estimate, which is the representation of the most recent analyst predictions, is calling for earnings of $1.05 per share. 2.       Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)Huntington Ingalls designs, builds, and maintains nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and provides after-market services for military ships around the globe. The defense firm is scheduled to release its latest report before the market opens on Feb. 15. HII is currently holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 5.32%.Our overall consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $2.92 per share and revenues of $2.01 billion. These results would represent growth rates of -20.4% and +4.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period. 3.       Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report)Deere & Company, the parent of the John Deere brand, builds agricultural, construction, and lawn care equipment.

208,HII,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a $195-million modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kits. The contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah.Details of the DealPer the terms, Boeing’s Defense Space and Security segment will manufacture additional JDAM tail kits. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $927.6 million, if the options included in the contract are exercised.Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be completed by Jan 30, 2020. Boeing will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2019 procurement funds to finance the order.A Brief Note on JDAMThe JDAM is a low-cost guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurately guided ""smart"" weapons. The JDAM kit consists of a new tail section that comprises an inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) and body strakes for additional stability and lift. With the help of JDAM, bombs can be accurately delivered in any weather conditions.The U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and militaries of more than 26 countries employ JDAM. Its first operational use was during Operation Allied Force in the Balkans in 1999. JDAM has been used extensively in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and most recently in NATO’s Operation Unified Protector in Libya.Our ViewBoeing’s Defense Space and Security segment has reflected a solid year in terms of revenues and margins along with securing some key awards and achieving critical program milestones, including its ongoing progress on the tanker program.Evidently, during the fourth quarter, Boeing’s Defense Space and Security business clinched a massive $10 billion of new orders that included foreign military sales contracts worth $6.2 billion from the Qatar Emiri Air Force.Considering the $700-billion fiscal 2018 defense policy bill sanctioned last September by the U.S. Senate, a smooth inflow of orders for Boeing’s defense products and equipment is expected.Moreover, the company has of late been witnessing solid funding support above the President's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and space launch system. Thus, we expect Boeing to win more defense contracts in the days to come, which in turn will help it maintain its position as one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors worldwide.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) Quote Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 112.8% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 57.2%.

209,HII,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 6. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 83 cents per share, reflecting a beat of 3.8%.We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Emerson is +1.39% as the Most Accurate estimate of 55 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Driving Better-than-Expected Results Emerson is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Going forward, Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers. Further, its restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Currently, the company’s Automation Solutions segment has been experiencing favorable trends in power and life sciences along with improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers, which is expected to boost growth. For the Commercial & Residential business, the company’s focus on domains like human comfort, connected home, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work, is likely to prove conductive for its operations. Going forward, we believe selected investment opportunities along with positive trends in certain business areas offer modest growth opportunities.The company’s accretive acquisitions are also anticipatedto be conducive to its top line, in the to-be reported quarter. The company’s acquisition of Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies will fortify presence in advanced flow measurement and control technologies. The company also acquired Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx and PakSense which are likely to drive sales.Despite these positives, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets is likely to affect both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, which in turn may hurt Emerson’s operations. This apart, currency fluctuations haveremained a headwind over the past few quarters, and mightimpact earnings and revenues in the upcoming release as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

210,HII,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) recently won a hybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) weapon systems program.Details of the DealThe contract is valued at $2.3 billion and has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, New Jersey.Apart from engineering services, Raytheon will offer services for ongoing support of software and to refresh for obsolescence to include support of systems outside the continental United States and partner country systems.Work is scheduled to be completed by Jan 31, 2023. Also, per the contract, work locations and funding will be determined with each received order.A Brief Note on PATRIOTPATRIOT is a long-range, high-altitude all-weather missile defense system designed to counter threats from tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced fighter aircraft. This missile defense system was successfully used during the 1991 Gulf and Iraq War.The system consists of radars, command-and-control technology and other multiple interceptors. It is designed and engineered to detect and identify tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aircraft and other threats.Raytheon also designs the popular PATRIOT missile defense interceptors and has been consistently focusing on upgrading this missile defense system in order to keep pace with the changing dynamics of modern warfare.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Raytheon’s PATRIOT missile defense systems have seen a number of buyers in recent times including international customers like Qatar, Korea, Poland and others. In November 2017, Sweden announced theselection of Raytheon’s combat proven Patriot Air and missile defense system capability and is expected to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) in mid-2018, which is approximately worth $1 billion. During the sametime frame, Romania also signed an LOA with the U.S. government to purchase PATRIOT. Such events have thus led the U.S. government to begin contract negotiations with Raytheon and subsequently help thelatter expand in Europe and strengthen its PATRIOT franchise.The strong demand for the system from existing customers also favors the company in a massive way. Armed forces of 14 countries already use this missile defense system and it also plans on expanding its market base in Japan and the Middle-East region. In early January, Raytheon clinched a new direct commercial contract for PATRIOT capabilities worth more than $1.5 billion.No doubt such a solid order flow for the system is capable of substantially stoking Raytheon’s top line. The company’s Integrated Defense Systems (“IDS”) division, which includes the PATRIOT program, recorded fourth-quarter 2017 net sales of $1,553 million, reflecting a 6% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We expect the latest contract to boost growth at this segment in the days ahead.Moreover, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.53 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% (per Markets and Markets research firm). Given the solid prospects, frequent contract wins from the Pentagon for high-end missile systems like the PATRIOT will help Raytheon gain traction in the aerospace and defense industry.Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 44.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 42.5%. The company’s growing demand for missile defense systems and expanding overseas business boosted the performance. Zacks Rank & Other Key Picks    Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems (SPR  -  Free Report), each of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

211,HII,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations, and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), which provides fresh, natural and organic food, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 11.3% for 3-5 years. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1.

212,HII,"Investors have been buoyed by TransDigm Group Incorporated’s (TDG  -  Free Report) recent winstreak, as TransDigm’s earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. The company is anticipated to continue the momentum driven bycomplementary acquisitions, positive industry trends, solid operational execution and steadily growing end markets.TransDigm’s performance has reflected well on its share price, exhibiting investor optimism. The company’s shares have appreciated 6.4% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s average growth of 2%. We believe that the industry is witnessing favorable broader trends, which should have a positive impact on the company, in the quarters to come. Read on to find out the key drivers for the company right now.Factors at PlayTransDigm’s long-term growth strategy rests on five pillars namely, expanding proprietary aerospace businesses; executing value-based operating strategy; decentralized organization structure; strategic acquisitions and a diligent capital allocation strategy. The company’s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped it generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth in the past few quarters. It has also aided operating margin expansion.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems/subsystems with a significant aftermarket presence. 90% of the company’s net sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, for which the company owns the intellectual property. Moreover, its Defense business has also been performing better than expectations, consequently adding to the company’s strength. The diversified revenue base reduces the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel thus playing a significant role in maintaining financial performance.The company’s frequent acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, has helped it bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share. During the fiscal fourth quarter, the acquired businesses of Tactair, Young & Franklin as well as the three product lines generated $26 million of additional sales. The company anticipates these acquisitions to help shift focus to higher growth segments, consequently becoming more competitive.Despite the positives, TransDigm is currently affected by escalating debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Further, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, it expects debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017.Further, the company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end markets, which has thwarted growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weakness in jet as well as helicopter markets have impacted the top line in recent times.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on TransDigm.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report). While Teledyne Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Huntington Ingalls Industries and Rockwell Collins carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Teledyne Technologies has surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.2%.Huntington Ingalls Industries has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 14.2%.Rockwell Collins has outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 2.6%.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

213,HII,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) business division, Defense, Space & Security, recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $6.2 billion. Per the terms of the deal, the company will procure 36 new F-15QA aircraft that will be provided to the Qatar Emiri Air Force.The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH and is scheduled to be over by Dec 30, 2022. FMS funds will be utilized to partially finance the work, which will be executed in St.Louis, MI.    A Brief Note on F-15 Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories. The F-15QA is a variant of F-15 that has been developed for the Qatar Air Force.Our ViewBoeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, with its defense business standing out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog.In particular, among other defense equipment, the company’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. So far, Boeing has manufactured more than 1,600 of the aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire the F-15, thereby indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability. In 2016, the company delivered 15 F-15s, up 25% from the year-ago tally.In October 2015, Boeing was selected by the U.S. Air Force as the prime contractor for its Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System program, which was initially valued at $4 billion. The program was developed to counter threats and protect air crew at an advanced level and aimed at upgrading F-15 aircraft.  Needless to say, this reflects the popularity that this particular jet enjoys in the United States.With rising security threats across the globe, apart from developed nations like the United States, developing economies like India, Qatar and a few more are ramping up their arsenal. Considering this we may expect further expansion of customer base for F-15, beyond its domestic realm, which in turn will boost Boeing’s profit from its defense business.Moreover, the $700-billion worth fiscal 2018 defense policy bill that got sanctioned this September by the U.S. Senate, is expected to boost the business of the major U.S. defense contractors like Boeing, General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBoeing’s stock has moved up 87.4% over a year, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 43.1%. This might have been led by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Zacks Rank Boeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

214,HII,"The Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract for the manufacture and delivery of 10 full-rate production P-8A aircraft from the 9th Lot. Of the 10 jets, seven will be provided to the U.S. Navy and three to the U.K. government. The contract will also offer Lot 9 segregable efforts, which include unknown obsolescence, class I change assessments and obsolescence monitoring.Details of the DealValued at $1.2 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Majority of the work will be carried out in Seattle, WA, while the rest will be executed at various other locations across the U.S. and Cambridge, U.K.Boeing will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales (FMS) funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2020.About P-8A AircraftBoeing’s P-8A Multi-mission Maritime aircraft, also known as Poseidon, is used for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is also capable of broad-area littoral operations.A derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, the P-8A, and its variant for India, the P-8I, combine superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability in the future battle space.Our ViewBeing one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s defense segment stands out among peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time. In July, it created a segment named Boeing Global Services (BGS) to include its Commercial Aviation Services businesses and certain Boeing Defense, Security & Services (BDS) businesses. The move is expected to enhance product efficiency and lower costs for Boeing's defense customers in addition to maintaining delivery schedules.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon.During the third quarter of 2017, the BDS segment booked new orders worth $6 billion. A similar rise in orders can be expected at this segment, with management consistently witnessing solid demand for its defense programs.Considering the approval of the $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act, we expect Boeing to win more contracts from the Pentagon buoyed by solid demand for its military aircraft.Price MovementBoeing has moved up about 87.4% in a year’s time compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with long-term robust demand for its commercial aircraft.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

215,HII,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest.

Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years.

216,HII,"As the third-quarter earnings season rings in, defense stocks are gearing up to report their quarterly numbers. Multi-industry conglomerate Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), well-known for its brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft, is scheduled to report its financial results on Oct 19, before the market opens.We expect sales growth in the Industrial segment, which constitutes a majority of Textron’s top line, to drive the company’s revenues. However, Bell segment continues to be a laggard, as witnessed in the past few quarters. Nevertheless, regular orders continue to provide an impetus to the company.Let’s discuss these factors influencing Textron’s quarterly results, in brief.Industrial Manufacturing — A CatalystTextron’s Industrial segment designs and manufactures variety of products including automotive engine components, specialized vehicles and varied industry-related tools and equipments. Within this segment, along the specialized vehicle business line, the acquisition of Arctic Cat — a leader in the recreational vehicle industry — in the first quarter of 2017, has been boosting the company's growth trajectory.Apart from gaining synergies from inorganic growth, this segment has also been benefiting from product innovation. It is worth mentioning in this context, the highly efficient ELiTE series lithium powered golf cars, which come with zero battery maintenance. Notably, the company delivered 8,000 units of this car, as of July, since its introduction earlier this year. All these factors led to an improved year-over-year expectation for Textron’s Industrial segment in the third quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s third quarter sales is pegged at $1.1 billion, reflecting a solid 28% rise from prior-year quarter’s sales of $886 million.Will Bell Segment Dent Textron’s Growth?Bell, another significant segment for Textron has been consistently delivering poor performance over the past few quarters. This time too the company expects its top line to be adversely affected due to this segment’s weak performance.. Notably, the consensus estimate for this segment’s third-quarter sales is pegged at $765 million, down 3% year over year.Nevertheless, this segment has been witnessing strong commercial orders, of late, for products like 407 GXPs, 412 EP helicopters as well as 505 Jet Ranger X choppers. Taking into account such solid orders, the segment’s profit has been increasing and management expects similar result in the third quarter as well. In line with this, our consensus estimate projected for $95 million profit for Bell, up 10.5% year over year.Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the aforementioned facets of Textron’s quarterly results, a steady inflow of orders for the company’s varied products from Pentagon can be expected to provide an impetus to its third-quarter sales. Among the notable deals that Textron won in the quarter, worth mentioning is the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract worth $499 million. Per the terms of the deal, the company will offer quality research to Air Force in developing, demonstrating, integrating and transitioning new air vehicle technologies and systems.On the flip side, improving pricing in the aviation market has not been able to boost the company’s aviation segment as evident from a declining year-over-year sales expectation for this unit. Our consensus estimate called for sales of $1.2 billion in third quarter, down 3% year over year.As a whole, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 62 cents, down 43.54% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $3.54 billion, implying an 8.84% year-over-year increase.Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Textron Inc. Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Textron is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Textron has an Earnings ESP of +2.24%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 64 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.

(HII  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8.

Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $791 million, reflecting year-over-year decline of 6.8%.Boeing being the primary client, the demand of its commercial jets influences Spirit AeroSystems’ prospects. Per Boeing’s fourth-quarter delivery numbers, a 38% drop was recorded in the deliveries of 777 modelwhich clearly shows declining demand. This in turn might have led Zacks analysts to slash top-line expectations for the Fuselage Systems segment.Other Factors at PlayAlthough delivery numbers remained unimpressive for the 777 program of Boeing, other primary programs like 737 and 787 reflected solid growth. Therefore, the overall fourth-quarter growth story for Spirit AeroSystems remains impressive.Demand for commercial airplanes has been rising on a steady improvement in passenger and freight traffic. As a result, the company’s long-term contracts with industry bellwethers like Boeing and Airbus Groupshould help boost quarterly top and bottom-line figures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spirit AeroSystems’ fourth-quarter earnings reflects annual growth of 37.1% on 5.1% higher revenues.  What Does the Zacks Model Predict?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Spirit AeroSystems this quarter.

218,HII,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but can’t register enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth shows that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow provide the company with more flexibility in relation to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, CBRE Group, Inc.  operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company. The company has expected sales growth rate of 6.9% for the current year and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Raymond James Financial, Inc.

219,HII,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening:Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), which provides fresh, natural, and organic food, has a VGM Score of B with an expected EPS growth rate of 11.3% for 3-5 years. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1.

220,HII,"Bell-Boeing, a joint venture between The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Bell Helicopter, an unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), recently won a contract for providing technical analysis, engineering and integration services to support the V-22 tiltrotor military aircraft platform.Details of the DealThe contract, worth $18 million, was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Funds will be allotted on issuance of individual task orders.Work will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, and Philadelphia, PA; and is expected to be complete by December 2022.A Brief Note on V-22 JetsBell-Boeing’s primary product — V-22 Osprey — is a multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. It has the capacity to carry 24 combat troops or up to 20,000 pounds of internal cargo or 15,000 pounds of external cargo.The V-22 tiltrotor has been deployed in numerous missions around the world, including casualty evacuation, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, resupply, VIP transport and theater security cooperation.Our ViewA rapid rise in terror attacks along with the widespread rise of ISIS has compelled nations across the globe to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. The present U.S. administration is also in favor of raising the defense spending in contrast to the budget sequestration enacted by the prior government.Reflective of this, the U.S. Senate approved a fiscal 2018 defense budget of $700 billion in September. Thus, it is obvious that defense majors like Boeing and Textron will receive an increased flow of contracts from the Pentagon, for their high-end defense equipments. The latest contract win by Bell-Boeing mirrors the same.Last month, the V-22 fleet of tiltrotor aircraft was announced to have achieved the milestone of 400,000 flight hours. This reflects strong demand for the aircraft and more contracts for this product can be expected in the days ahead. Such contract wins will certainly drive revenues for Textron and Boeing.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has gained about 80.5% in a year’s time, surpassing the broader industry’s 29.3%. The outperformance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets.  Meanwhile, Textron's stock has gained around 11.4% in a year, lagging the industry’s rally. The underperformance has been led by excessive capital expenditure incurred by the company, along with its declining profit margins.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Textron has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report).Huntington Ingalls, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), boasts a long-term earnings growth of 19.4%. On average, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 14.22% in the trailing four quarters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Leidos Holdings, also carrying a Zacks Rank #2, boasts a long-term earnings growth of 17.2%.

221,HII,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense, Space & Security segment has been witnessing solid demand for its varied product offerings. The favorable defense budget has been another key catalyst for this segment’s growth. However, rising cost for tanker program remains a major concern. We expect Boeing’s fourth-quarter 2017 results, scheduled for release on Jan 31, to duly reflect these factors.Deliveries – A Mixed BagOn Jan 9, 2018, Boeing announced fourth-quarter and 2017 delivery figures. In 2017 Boeing delivered 174 defense products, down from 185 a year ago. Total deliveries consisted of 68 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 44 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). The company also delivered 23 F/A-18s, 19 P-8s, 16 F-15s, one Military Satellite, and three Commercial and Civil Satellites.In the fourth quarter Boeing dispatched 43defense products, up from the year-ago period figure of 40. Total deliveries consisted of 17 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 10 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). The company also delivered five each of P-8’s, F/A-18s, P-8s, and F-15s along with one Military Satellite.Budget Reform: A BoonThe recent budgetary reforms adopted by the Trump administration have been fueling growth for defense contractors like Boeing. The company has been witnessing notable funding support above the president's budget request for a number of programs such as F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, P-8 Poseidon and others.Inflow of orders from Pentagon as well as other U.S. allies for varied products of Boeing will get duly reflected in the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results.Will Contract Wins be an Efficient Growth Driver?Keeping up its trend, Boeing’s defense business won a number of multi-billion dollar contracts in the fourth quarter as well. However, a question remains as to whether such notable orders can aid the segment’s growth.In the third quarter also such order growth has been witnessed, yet this segment’s top line suffered a plunge. Rising cost related to the company’s tanker program most probably influenced this decline.In 2011, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing a deal for designing, developing, manufacturing and delivering four next generation aerial refueling tankers – KC-46A. Related to this program, Boeing has been reeling under higher cost due to changes in initial production aircraft, as it progresses through late-stage testing and the certification process.Although the flight test airplanes are performing well under this program, the final product is expected to be delivered in 2018. So the fourth-quarter results for Boeing’s defense business are also expected to incur ballooning costs, in turn denting the segment’s sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this unit’s fourth-quarter sales is $5.5 billion which reflects a year-over-year decline of 19.3%. Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) Quote Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsBoeing currently does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a Look Here are a few stocks in the Aerospace and Defense space worth considering as they have the right combination to deliver a beat:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 15. The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and a Zacks Rank #2.

222,HII,"The year 2017 has been an overwhelming one for the U.S. economy, courtesy of President Trump’s policies that came up with many positive market movements. The fiscal 2018 (FY18) budget proposal, in particular, along with a rising interest rate environment backed by improving economic backdrop as well as progress on tax reforms have helped the S&P 500 index surge 20.1%, so far this year.Coming to the Aerospace sector, stocks in this space have been on a growth trajectory on anticipation of the new administration’s favoritism toward huge defense spending, since last year when Trump became the President. This year also the sector maintained similar trends.Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector (a stand-alone sector) have rallied 38.1% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 20.1% gain. Below we have discussed the major factors that have influenced the stocks in this sector, in recent times.Positives That Drove Aerospace Stocks: FY18 Budget and North Korea TiffThe FY18 defense budget reflected a 10% hike from the FY16 level. In fact, a favorable defense spending strategy endorsed by the U.S. administration has been a primary force driving these stocks. In September 2017 the U.S. Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), better known as the FY18 defense policy bill, worth roughly $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump’s budget request. It authorized an additional $8.5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland, regional and space missile defense, which is $630 million higher than the new administration's request.Meanwhile, there’s no denying that, while a slew of contract wins have been boosting defense stocks over the years, repeated counteractive missile-tests conducted by the United States and North Korea have been instrumental in the sector’s latest outperformance. In particular, following Trump’s strong condemning of North Korea’s hostile action, companies that either manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), gained substantially.Additionally, an anticipated military action in the Korean peninsula and a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies have bolstered the sector’s performance. To fend off competition, Aerospace players are merging with their counterparts to restructure business models as well as expand their core operations and product lines. For example, United Technologies Corp. (UTX) decided to take over Rockwell Collins, Inc. for $30 billion this September. This mega deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.In the same month, Northrop Grumman agreed to buy rocket-maker Orbital ATK, Inc., for $9.2 billion. Post the deal, Northrop Grumman will benefit from Orbital’s rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.Challenges Exist TooLike all sectors, the Aerospace space is faced with multiple headwinds. For instance, questions are still being raised on the FY18 budget and the viability of such high spending.Workforce-related issues like retaining aged workers along with employing graduates who lack technical acumen has been challenging the aerospace and defense industry. Per the Aviation Week & Space Technology 2017 Aerospace & Defense Workforce Study, approximately 60% of employees in this industry are over the age of 45 versus 44% in the overall U.S. workforce. Moreover, various regulations imposed on international trade of defense equipment remain the major deterrents to the sector’s growth.Moreover, internationally many emerging nations are posing stiff competition to the U.S. defense contractors. For instance, China is developing space technologies to block U.S. military communications, per a report commissioned by a panel formed by Congress. Similarly, per a CNBC report, Russian defense officials have confirmed deploying radar-imagery jammers and developing laser weapons to counter U.S. intelligence and ballistic missile defense satellites.Choosing the Winning StrategyConsidering all the aforementioned factors, we can say that Aerospace stocks exhibited a decent progress graph, so far this year, weathering all the headwinds. Notably, the stocks witnessed solid bottom-line profitability and top-line growth.In order to save investors from the time-taking process of identifying the key winners that crushed the market and are likely to gain further, we have created a screen using the Zacks Stock Screener.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

223,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently clinched a modification contract worth $115 million. Per the deal the company will provide integrated logistics services and site activation support to the U.S. Navy and the government of Australia for P-8A aircraft. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 2021.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Majority of the work will be executed in Seattle, WA and Oklahoma City, OK. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds to partially finance the task.P-8A AircraftP-8A Multi-mission Maritime aircraft, also known as Poseidon, is used for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is also capable of broad-area littoral operations.A derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, the P-8A, and its variant for India, the P-8I, combine superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability during combats.Our ViewBeing one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s defense segment stands out among its peers by the virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlogs. The company reshapes its defense portfolio time to time. In July 2017, it created a segment named Boeing Global Services (BGS) to include its Commercial Aviation Services businesses and certain Boeing Defense, Security & Services (BDS) businesses. The move is expected to enhance product efficiency and lower costs in addition to maintaining delivery schedules.Among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs including P-8A, the company has been clinching a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. Evidently, last month the company won a modification contract worth $1.2 billion for the manufacture and delivery of 10 full-rate production P-8A aircraft from the 9th Lot.During the third quarter of 2017, the BGS segment booked new orders worth $6 billion. A similar rise in orders can be expected at this segment, with management consistently witnessing solid demand for its defense programs.Considering the approval of the $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act, we expect Boeing to win more contracts from the Pentagon buoyed by solid demand for military aircraft.Price MovementBoeing’s shares have moved up about 102.3% in a year’s time compared with the broader industry’s gain of 49.3%. The outperformance was primarily led by higher demand for military and commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), each of which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

224,HII,"The Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense, Space and Security unit recently secured a modification contract worth $193.6 million for the production of Increment 1, Lots 12-14 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). Per the terms of the deal, the company will purchase an additional quantity of 6,000 SDBs.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Work related to the deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO and is scheduled to be over by Dec 30, 2020.The contract involves foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, South Korea and Singapore. Boeing will utilize fiscal 2015 and 2016 missile procurement and foreign military sales funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on SDBBoeing’s SDB is the next generation of low-cost and low collateral-damage precision strike weapons for internal and external carriage. It comes with a range greater than 60 nautical miles. The SDB carriage allows four weapons to be carried in one aircraft weapon station.SDBs are 250-pound class bombs that allow the artillery system to hit targets from significantly longer distances and engage hard-to-reach targets, while maintaining the SDB’s flight maneuverability and accuracy.Currently, SDB is employed externally on F-15E, F-16 Block 30/40/50, Gripen and GR4 Tornado smart stations and is internally, integrated in the bays of the F-22A, F-35A, and Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles.Our ViewBoeing’s SDB is also one of the very few weapon systems of its kind in the market. Being one of the largest defense contractors in the United States, the company serves the U.S. aerospace and defense industry and its allies by producing, integrating and supporting precise, long-range and focused munitions capabilities. Currently, the demand for SDB is huge, given the fact that apart from the United States, eight foreign allies of the country use this precision weapon.With more nations bumping up their defense spending, Boeing consistently enjoys big order flow from the international market for advanced arsenal like SDB. Toward this end, the company won a FMS contract worth $700 million for SDB production.Notably, the Defense, Space & Security segment saw a sales decline in the third quarter of 2017. We believe strong order flow for weapons at this segment, like the latest contract, will allow the company to bounce back to positive sales growth for its defense business.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has moved up about 86.9% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with long-term robust demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc.

225,HII,"Bell-Boeing, a joint venture between The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Bell Helicopter, unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), recently won a contract to offer support to ongoing flight tests and evaluation of the V-22 test aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Details of the DealThe contract, worth $23.3 million, was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Work will be carried out in Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Marylandand Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement and fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the work.A Brief Note on V-22 JetsBell-Boeing’s primary product — V-22 Osprey — is a multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. It has the capacity to carry 24 combat troops or up to 20,000 pounds of internal cargo or 15,000 pounds of external cargo.The V-22 tiltrotor has been deployed in numerous missions around the world, including casualty evacuation, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, resupply, VIP transport and theater security cooperation.Our ViewA rapid rise in terror attacks along with the widespread rise of ISIS has compelled nations across the globe to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. The present U.S. administration is also in favor of raising the defense spending in contrast to the budget sequestration enacted by the prior government.The fiscal 2018 defense bill policy worth $700 billion, approved by the U.S. Senate last September, supports this fact. Thus, it is obvious that defense majors like Boeing and Textron will receive an increased flow of contracts from the Pentagon for their high-end defense equipment. The latest contract win by Bell-Boeing mirrors the same.Moreover, in November 2017, the V-22 fleet of tiltrotor aircraft was announced to have achieved the milestone of 400,000 flight hours. This reflects strong demand for the aircraft and more contracts for this product can be expected in the days ahead. Such contract wins will certainly drive revenues for Textron and Boeing.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has gained about 86.9% in a year’s time, surpassing the broader industry’s 37.2%. The outperformance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets.  Meanwhile, Textron's stock has gained around 14.6% in a year, lagging the industry’s rally. The underperformance has been led by excessive capital expenditure incurred by the company along with declining profit margins.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Textron has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors can consider better-ranked stocks in the same industry such as Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and Leidos Holdings, Inc.

226,HII,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (WAIR  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in WAIR.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 77 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 66 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Wesco Aircraft has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 13 cents a share from 19 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 14.9% in the past month.Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.

227,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) Ingalls Shipbuilding unit recently secured a modification contract for the execution of USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) emergent repair and restoration. The work is expected to be over by September 2018.The deal, which is valued at $63 million, has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to the contract will be carried out in Pascagoula, MS, and the company will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task.The deal entails the removal of damaged portions of the ship along with maintenance, modernization and collision repair.About Ingalls ShipbuildingIngalls Shipbuilding manufactures Aegis DDG 51 class guided missile destroyers, LHA 6 class large deck amphibious ships, National Security Cutters for the U.S. Coast Guard and is the sole builder of the Navy’s fleet of San Antonio (LPD 17) class amphibious assault ships.A Brief Note on USS FitzgeraldThe USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) is a guided missile destroyer battleship belonging to the Arleigh Burke class of surface ships, currently serving the U.S. Navy. While DD represents the basic destroyers per US Navy classifications, G stands for its guided missile armament design. It is built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multifunction passive electronically scanned array radar.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. More than 70% of the active Navy fleet comprises ships from this company. Notably, its Ingalls Shipbuilding division is the nation’s largest supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants and has built nearly 70% of the U.S. Navy fleet of warships.This division delivered a solid result in the third quarter of 2017. The segment witnessed increased sales volumes and a 2.8% increase in revenues from the year-ago period, primarily on higher revenues in amphibious assault ships. The latest contract can be expected to add more impetus to this division’s growth, in coming days.Looking ahead, given the positive budget revision done by the Trump administration, we may expect to witness the company’s overall growth momentum to continue with stability. The raised budget will draw more contracts for Huntington Ingalls.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied about 26.7% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 43.1%. The stock performance was primarily dented by intense competition in the military shipbuilding space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zacks Rank & Key PicksHuntington Ingalls carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

228,HII,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. unit recently secured a modification contract worth $255.3 million for low-rate initial production (LRIP) of three MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft from the 3rd Lot. Per the terms of the deal, the company will manufacture trade studies and tooling to support the Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Majority of the work will be carried out in San Diego, CA; Baltimore, MD; Red Oak, TX and Palmdale, CA. The remaining work will be executed in other locations in the United States.Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds to complete the work by December 2021.A Brief Note on MQ-4C TritonMQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system (UAS) provides real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions.Based on the proven Global Hawk UAS, Triton is equipped with a unique and robust mission sensor suite that provides 360-degree coverage on all sensors. These sensors offer unprecedented maritime domain awareness for the U.S. Navy.Built for the U.S. Navy, Triton supports a wide range of missions including maritime ISR patrol, signals intelligence, search and rescue and communications relay. The aircraft can fly over 24 hours at a time, at altitudes higher than 10 miles, with an operational range of 8,200 nautical miles.Our ViewWith increasing security threats across the globe, nations are consistently boosting their arsenal. In November 2017, the U.S. Navy announced plans to deploy Triton to NAS Mayport, Florida, NAS Sigonella, Italy and the Middle East. Toward this end, the department has placed an order for 68 Triton aircraft, which we believe will enable Northrop Grumman to generate higher revenues.During the third quarter of 2017, Northrop Grumman’s Aerospace Systems sales increased a solid 10.8%, driven by manned aircraft as well as autonomous systems like Triton. We believe strong order flow for Triton will boost this segment’s growth.With the current U.S. administration in favor of huge defense spending, extensive revenue generation from the Triton program reflecting significant demand as well as latest contract wins from Pentagon, we expect Northrop Grumman to achieve its financial targets.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has moved up about 29.9% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.7%.

229,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat, has clinched a $28.6 million modification contract to exercise options for reactor plant planning yard services for nuclear-powered submarines.The company will also support yard services for the Navy’s moored training ships. Markedly, the deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractPer the modification contract, Electric Boat will offer furnishing, fabricating, or purchasing materials, supplies and services that will likely be required to perform the functions of the planning yard for reactor plants and related portions of the propulsion plants for nuclear powered submarines. The unit will also support yard services for moored training ships.While majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT, the rest will be performed at Charleston, SC. It will be completed, using fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) as well as fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds, by September 2018.Nuclear Submarines and the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.Currently, the U.S. Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.In fact, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States, operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). As a result, both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins.In this context, it is imperative to mention that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, in the fiscal 2017 budget proposal $8.1 billion fund was allocated for submarines.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. In addition, the company is a prime contractor for the development of Columbia-class submarines and Virginia-class submarines.Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, we believe the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Furthermore, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Going forward, the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have surged 41.8% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%. This might have been caused by the company’s declining backlogs in recent times. Additionally, the stock faces stiff competition from its industry peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Work related to this deal will be executed at the company’s shipbuilding yard in Newport New, VA.Valued at $65.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the deal, the company will conduct repairing, maintenance, upgrades and modernization of USS Helena. Huntington Ingalls will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task by April 2018.A Brief Note on USS HelenaUSS Helena (SSN 725) is a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. Notably, the Los Angeles-class forms the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine force.Nuclear Submarines & the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. Notably, the modern-day nuclear-powered submarines are markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.In the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report).

Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How Will the Deal Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 47.1% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 46.9% gain. The company is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S. Over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships and the company continues to enjoy strong order growth from the U.S. Navy.

231,HII,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), known for brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft, is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, before the market opens.We expect sales growth at the Industrial segment, which accounts for the majority of Textron’s top line, to drive fourth-quarter revenues. Moreover, a rebound in the Bell segment after many quarters of weakperformance buoys optimism.Let’s discuss these factors in detail.Industrial Segment — A Key CatalystTextron’s Industrial segment designs and manufactures variety of products, including automotive engine components, specialized vehicles and varied industry-related tools and equipment. The acquisition of Arctic Cat — a leader in the recreational vehicle industry — made in the first quarter of 2017, has been boosting growth at this segment.In fact, this buyout drove third-quarter sales by double digits at the segment. We expect the takeover to drive revenues at this segment in the fourth quarter as well. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $1.2 billion, reflecting a solid 21.6% rise from the prior-year quarter’s $952 million.Will Bell Segment Drive Growth?Bell, another important segment for Textron, has been able to deliver improved results in the third quarter, after quarters of poor performance. In particular, strong demand for commercial jets drove the top line higher at this unit. With management expecting to maintain the upside in commercial deliveries, we expect the fourth-quarter results to reflect top-line growth at the Bell segment.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $918 million, reflecting a 3.5% rise from prior-year quarter’s $887 million.Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the aforementioned factors, improved growth pattern and performance and a steady inflow of orders from Pentagon are expected to provide an impetus to fourth-quarter sales. Among the deals clinched in the fourth quarter, the one worth mentioning is the $333-million contract from U.S. Army for up to 255 mobile strike force vehicles.All these factors are expected to boost Textron’s fourth-quarter revenues, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $4.04 billion, which reflects a year-over-year improvement of 5.6%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 6.25% year over year. This could be because the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from fixed-price contracts, exposing the bottom line to cost overruns.Moreover, during the third-quarter earnings call, management announced that its vehicle business is lagging in terms of line rates and production output. These factors as well as a charge associated with the TAPV program incurred in the first quarter of 2017 have compelled management to slash the 2017 EPS guidance.Textron Inc.

232,HII,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Commercial Airplanes segment has been consistently witnessing solid deliveries, buoyed by the increasing demand for its commercial jetliners 737, 787 and 747 in the domestic as well as international market. We expect this strength to get reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 31, before the market opens.Solid Deliveries Buoy OptimismOn Jan 9, 2018, Boeing announced upbeat fourth-quarter and 2017 delivery figures. The company dispatched 763 jets in 2017, up 2% from the year-ago figure of 748 jets, buoyed by higher 737, 747 and 767 deliveries. The figure was within the company’s delivery guidance of 760-765.In 2017, Boeing delivered 529 jets of the 737 fleet and 136 of the 787 fleet. In the year-ago period, the company delivered 490 units of the 737 and 137 units of the 787 fleet. Boeing delivered 74 units of the 777 model in 2017, compared with 99 units a year ago. Other deliveries include 10 767s and 14 747s, compared with 13 and 9 units, respectively.Coming to its fourth-quarter deliveries, Boeing reported fourth-quarter 2017 commercial deliveries of 209 airplanes, up year over year backed by higher demand for 737 and 747 jets. Sequentially, the numbers went up 3.5%. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 148 in the fourth quarter from 122 a year ago.Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners totaled 16 and 36, compared with 26 and 33 in the year-ago period, respectively. The company’s delivered 6 747 and 3 767 jets, compared with 1 747 and 3 767 in the year-ago quarter.Dubai Air Show — A Grand Success Dubai Air Show, held in November 2017, witnessed some landmark deals involving renowned jet makers from across the globe, with total orders booked worth $114 billion. Apart from Airbus Group (EADSY), Boeing sealed majority of the game-changing deals in this event, which we believe will boost its results in the quarter to be reported.Notably, the company sealed a deal worth $15.1 billion for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates airline, on the very first day of the show. The company clinched another significant deal worth $27 billion for delivering 225 737 MAX airplanes to flydubai airlines. This marked the largest-ever single-aisle jet order for Boeing, from a Middle East carrier.Apart from these two orders, Boeing received an order from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for supplying 20 additional 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion. Additionally, the company secured an order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters, valued at $1.9 billion, from Azerbaijan Airlines.Will 737 be a Major Growth Driver?Demand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been on the rise due to a steady improvement in passenger and freight traffic. Per Boeing's current market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. Single-aisle jets are expected to be the major demand driver, comprising 72% of the total projection.Interestingly, the company’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Interestingly, majority of the commercial orders Boeing won in 2017 belonged to the 737-fleet.Considering the fact that 737 is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from more than 92 customers, we expect this fleet of jet to play the role of a key catalyst for Boeing’s fourth-quarter results.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) Quote Will Huge Orders Drive the Top Line?Apart from the aforementioned orders that Boeing won in the Dubai Air Show, the company received a number of multi-billion dollar orders in the fourth quarter. Thus such huge order growth is expected to boost the Commercial Airplanes segment’s revenues.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Commercial Airplanes segment’s revenue is pegged at $14.9 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.8%. This may have been driven by lower delivery rates for the company’s 777 jets.Indeed a 38% drop was witnessed in the fourth quarter deliveries of 777 model, which clearly show lack of demand for this particular jet. In fact, realizing its declining demand, Boeing implemented a planned production rate decrease from 8.3 per month to 7 per month during first-quarter 2017, which was further reduced to the rate of 5 per month in third-quarter 2017.Also deferred production cost for the 787 Dreamliner product line remains a concern for this segment’s growth. Though the company is witnessing declining costs, it hasn’t been able to completely waive off the same.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsBoeing currently does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%.

233,HII,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Missile Systems segment recently secured a modification contract to exercise options for design agent and engineering support services for the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) upgraded MK-31 Guided Missile Weapon System Improvement program.Valued at $22.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Missile Systems will support maintenance of current weapon system capability. It will also help resolve issues through design, systems, software maintenance, reliability, maintainability, quality assurance and logistics engineering services.Work related to the contract will be executed in Tucson, AZ, and Louisville, KY. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 funds procured from the U.S. Navy, German foreign military sales (FMS), Egyptian FMS and Qatar FMS to complete the task by September 2019.Note on MK-31 Guided Missile Weapon SystemThe MK-31 RAM Guided Missile Weapon System is a cooperative development and production program conducted by the U.S. and the Federal Republic of Germany, under a memorandum of understanding. Manufactured by Raytheon, this weapon system is the most modern self-defense weapon system, deployed from ships, to destroy anti-ship missiles. It has been specifically designed to provide protection to ships of all sizes.Our ViewRaytheon’s Missile Systems segment has been gaining significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenal. In August 2017, the company won a $614.5-million worth modification contract from the Missile Defense Agency for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles.On the international front, the company is witnessing growing demand for missile defense systems in Europe on increased global threat dynamics as well as rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In November 2017, Reuters reported that the Swedish government is willing to spend more than $1 billion on Raytheon's Patriot surface-to-air defense missile system. Raytheon is also building missiles that may be utilized by the U.S. government to counter an attack by North Korea.Meanwhile, the defense industry received a boost from the U.S. Senate approval of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion this September. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying troops. We believe the raised budget will certainly draw more contracts for defense major like Raytheon and also help it achieve its missile business targets. The latest contract is an example of that.Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 33.8% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 29%. The growing demand for missile defense systems and approval of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill boosted the overall performance.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksRaytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

234,HII,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract worth $20.6 million for planning and execution of USS Washington (SSN 787) in the post-delivery work period. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by February 2018.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Groton, CT. Per the terms of the agreement, Electric Boat will conduct planning and execution-related tasks including long-lead-time material procurement. These tasks will aid in accomplishing the maintenance, repair, alterations, testing and other work on USS Washington during the scheduled post-delivery work period.Majority of the work will be carried out in Newport News, VA. The company will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016, and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion funds to finish the task.A Brief Note on USS WashingtonUSS Washington is a nuclear powered, fast attack submarine (SSN) designed to operate in shallow coastal regions and maintaining the capacity for open ocean submarine warfare. It is the 14th Virginia-class attack submarine.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), another stalwart in military shipbuilding space, along with General Dynamics, co-manufactured USS Washington. It is believed, that upon delivery, this ship will be the most technologically advanced submarine in the U.S. Navy’s service. It will also be the least expensive submarine as its design incorporates significant innovations to reduce acquisition costs over earlier ships of the class without impacting mission capabilities. The USS Washington was commissioned on Oct 7.Our ViewBeing one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprises 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.The Navy plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years. This will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  In fact, the Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM.Since majority of such attack submarines are co-developed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, for the construction of VPM, Pentagon will offer lucrative additional defense contracts to both these shipbuilders, which, in turn, is expected to boost their growth trajectory.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics with the company being identified as the prime contractor for Virginia-Class submarines, in 2016. As a result, we expect the latest modification contract has the ability to put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics's have rallied about 40.9% over a year, underperforming the industry's gain of 55%. This may have been caused by the fact that the company is witnessing declining backlogs in recent times. Moreover, the stock also faces stiff competition from its industry peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

235,HII,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, courtesy of  a number of favorable factors both domestic as well as international. Also, Trump’s latest moves and policies have been helping the stocks to recover from the losses incurred due to the budget sequestration imposed by the previous administration.Coming to the third quarter’s performance, the industry ended the period on a positive note racking up a market-thumping return. Evidently, the Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry gained 16.8% in the September quarter, higher than the S&P 500’s return of 3.8%.To understand what led the defense stocks to outperform the broader market, we have briefly mentioned below the factors that boosted the industry in the past three months.  Budget UpsideOf late, geo-political tensions and terrorist activities are on the rise globally. These incidents have been driving the demand of defense products, in turn providing a substantial impetus to the stocks. Also, the recent U.S. budgetary amendments have been driving the stocks.To this end, the recently approved defense bill policy worth $700 billion is worth mentioning. In particular, on Jul 14, 2017, the U.S. House passed the FY18 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion that surpassed Trump’s March budget request worth $610 billion.Finally, in late September, the Senate approved a $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which included a funding provision of $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It goes without saying that the funding significantly boosted the growth prospects of defense stocks.Trump’s Take on International IssuesThe global market, during the third quarter, witnessed continued cross-border tension between North Korea and the United States as the former conducted repeated missile tests targeting the United States and its allies.ratioThese rapid altercations boded well for the U.S. defense bellwethers as rising geopolitical tensions always prompt the government to strengthen its arsenals. The hostile activities of North Korea and the U.S. administrations‘ repeated warnings to the nation, in response, provided a strong impetus to a number of defense majors, which scale new all-time highs in Q3.Moreover, in late August, while discussing his Afghanistan strategy, Trump announced plans to not to withdraw forces from the nation but “fight to win,” integrating diplomacy with military power. Following this announcement, defense stocks moved north in anticipation of escalated military actions. We believe Trump’s foreign policy will also provide further impetus to these stocks.Prudent DealsRecent merger deals between major aerospace and defense companies have also been acting as major catalysts for the industry.In September, United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins Inc. for $30 billion. Once completed, the deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.With the acquisition, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation.On the other hand, later in the same month, Northrop Grumman inked a deal to buy Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. With the acquisition, Northrop Grumman will benefit from Orbital ATK's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.5 Stocks Worth Adding to Your PortfolioWith the industry outperforming the broader market in the September quarter and promising to yield higher returns, we have shortlisted five defense stocks that have rallied more than 10% during the third quarter and have outperformed the S&P 500’s gain.The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. It is also one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors. Apart from manufacturing combat-proven military jets and high-end commercial aircraft, Boeing also produces missiles and related weapons and works in tandem with NASA in the Space Launch System.Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

236,HII,"Growth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors’ attention, and produce big gains as well. However, they can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over, so it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their businesses.One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). This firm, which is in the Aerospace-Defense industry, saw EPS growth of 16.3 % last year, and is looking great for this year too.In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 18.4%.

237,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for providing fiscal 2018 lead yard services and development studies and design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.  Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Groton, CT.Details of the DealValued at $432 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the modification, the lead yard services will maintain, update, and support the Virginia-class design and related drawings and data for Virginia-class submarines. This will include technology insertion, throughout its construction and post shakedown availability period.Moreover, the company will provide engineering and related lead yard services necessary for direct maintenance and support of Virginia-class ship specifications. In addition, this contract will offer development studies and design efforts related to the Virginia-class submarine design and design improvements, preliminary and detail component and system design, integration of system engineering, design engineering, test engineering, logistics engineering and production engineering.Development studies and design efforts will also be supplied in relation to components and systems to accomplish research and development tasks and prototypes and engineering development models required to evaluate new technologies to be inserted in succeeding Virginia-class submarines.Fiscal 2018, 2017, 2012, 2015, 2013, 2014 and 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds,  as well as fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 research, development, test and engineering funds will be utilized to complete the task by December 2018.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued at around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. With widespread geo-political tensions looming over the globe, nations are strengthening up their arsenals and boosting up their naval power through upgrading submarines is one such strategy.In line with this, considering the solid demand for the Virginia-class submarine, the U.S. Navy plans to build an advanced model of this submarine in the subsequent years. This latest model will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  We believe the launch tubes of VPM will have the capability to carry a total of 28 additional Tomahawk cruise missiles.In fact, the Navy earlier proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM. This indicates additional defense contracts for General Dynamics, which, in turn, is expected to boost the company’s growth trajectory.Further, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted for the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor. As a result, we believe that the modification contract will undoubtedly put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Industry ScenarioIn September, the U.S. Senate approved a $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act, which provides necessary funding to the U.S. Military to carry out activities in homeland and overseas. The bill authorizes $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.The defense expenditure for fiscal 2018 is expected to exceed fiscal 2017 levels by nearly $83 billion. The defense spending approved by the Senate is higher than what President Trump had requested for. This has raised the growth prospects of defense primes like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In addition, the bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. This would benefit the nation’s prime shipbuilders like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls.Price Performance General Dynamics’ stock has returned 12% over a year, underperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the prior U.S. government.  Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

238,HII,"Aerospace behemoth The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $296.82 before closing the Dec 14 session a tad lower at $293.88. The stock has delivered an impressive one-year return of about 90.2% while the S&P 500 has returned 18.2% over the same time period.Over the past 52 weeks, Boeing’s share price has ranged from a low of $153.06 to a high of $296.82. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 3.26 million.Why is Boeing Moving Up?Boeing with its high quality commercial aircraft and defense offering is well poised to gain from improvement in passenger traffic and rise in defense budget.Its defense business stands out among its peers by the virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. Boeing remains on track with the $52 billion KC-46 aerial tanker program. It is scheduled to complete delivery of all 179 aircraft by 2027. Apart from the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program, the new organization will also oversee the building of the presidential aircraft for the Air Force along with the CST-100 spacecraft for NASA.At the end of the third quarter, the backlog of commercial airplanes touched 5,679. This clearly indicates the dominance and popularity of Boeing in commercial aerospace. The company received orders for 223 airplanes in the last two months.Per Boeing's current market outlook, the company anticipates that the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. Boeing expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years.Boeing’s single aisle 737 MAX and the current 737-800 will be the major growth catalysts and the company expects to boost 737 production to 57 airplanes per month in 2019 from 52 per month in 2018. However, Boeing is expected to face tough completion from Airbus SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) single aisle A-320 aircraft.Internationally, the company is witnessing strong demand for its commercial and defense products. Boeing is also expanding its presence in cyber security, intelligence and surveillance and unmanned systems. The rising foreign military sales contracts are more than welcome along with the domestic orders.Thanks to its consistent performance, the company is also able to increase value of its shareholders through buyback and repurchases.Long-term earnings growth rate is expected to be 13%. The company came out with positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters resulting in average surprise of 5.84%.

239,HII,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 31.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by constant contract wins along with higher jet deliveries. Meanwhile a solid cash generating capability also boosts this aerospace giant’s growth.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of big orders for its commercial jets in the fourth quarter including a $27-billion order from flydubai for 225 737 MAX jets and an $11-billion contract from Avolon for 75 737-MAX airplanes. Again, it sealed a deal worth $15.1 billion for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates.Among the defense contracts won in the fourth quarter, the significant ones include a $6-billion deal for procuring 36 F-15QA aircraft for the Qatar Emiri Air Force. Boeing also clinched a contract worth $1.2-billion modification contract for manufacturing and delivering 10 full-rate production P-8A aircraft. The company won a contract worth $240 million for the Royal Saudi Air Force airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $24.83 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.6%.Such improving top line indicates at solid bottom-line growth for the company. In line with this, the consensus estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.91 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.8%.Impressive Q4 Orders & DeliveriesBoeing’s fourth-quarter deliveries showed a 12.8% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. Also, defense shipments improved 7% than the year-ago figure. Higher demand for the 737 and 767 jets primarily drove the year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries. In the last quarter, the company delivered 209 airplanes.In the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 43 in the fourth quarter compared with 40 in the year-ago quarter.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) QuoteDividend Hike: A Strong PositiveBoeing’s strong cash generating capability provides the company with financial flexibility, which in turn allows it to hike dividend significantly and repurchase shares, thereby making the stock a valuable choice for investors. Notably, its cash and investments in marketable securities was $10.03 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the first nine months of 2017, Boeing paid $2.58 billion in dividends and repurchased 39.5 million shares for $7.5 billion.Last month, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 20.4%. Impressively, Boeing has increased its dividend per share by more than 250% over the last five years. Along with the dividend hike, the company authorized a new stock repurchase plan of $18 billion, which replaces the existing share-buyback program.The raised dividend and the new buyback authorization indicate Boeing’s optimism on solid cash inflow that is further supported by its large and diverse order backlog. We expect the company’s yet-to-be reported results to reflect huge backlog for its jets, both defense and commercial.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

240,HII,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense, Space & Security business segment recently secured a modification contract for providing sustainment support to its E-4B military aircraft. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Nov 30, 2018.Details of the DealThe contract, with a ceiling value of $80 million, was awarded by the Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, OK. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer program management, field service representative, system integration laboratory, spare procurement, repair/overhaul, emergency support and engine overhaul. The related work will be carried out in Oklahoma City, OK and Offutt Air Force Base, NE. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to partially finance the deal.A Brief Note on E-4BThe E-4B, a militarized version of the Boeing 747-200, is a four-engine, swept-wing, long-range high-altitude airplane capable of refueling in flight. An E-4B can provide seating for up to 112 people, including a joint-service operations team, Air Force flight crew, maintenance and security component, communications team and selected augmentees.These aircraft are equipped with 13 external communications systems and are designed for 72 hours long missions. Their aircraft provide protection against electromagnetic radiation and nuclear blast.Secondary missions assigned to the E-4B include VIP travel along with Federal Emergency Management Agency support, which facilitates communications in relief works following natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. The company's defense segment stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time. Effective July 2017, it created a new segment — Boeing Global Services (BGS) — to include its  Commercial Aviation Services businesses, and certain Boeing Defense, Security & Services (BDS) businesses (primarily those previously included in the Global Services & Support segment). The move is expected to enhance product efficiency and lower costs for Boeing's defense customers in addition to maintaining delivery schedules.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.For example in October, the company won a contract worth $240 million for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1. In the month prior to that, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $600 million to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program.Additionally, recent Senate approval for the $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. This, in turn, will most likely prove to be beneficial for defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) in the near term.Although BDS segment’s performance was weak in the third quarter of 2017, management expects this business unit is poised to grow, going forward. Considering the current favorable budgetary scenario, we anticipate that such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, like the latest one, will help Boeing to achieve its desired business expansion in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 81.5% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.1%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.  Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

241,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit recently secured a modification contract for providing deployment system support to Trident II (D5) missile. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Valued at $71.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Majority of the work will be carried out in Cape Canaveral, FL; Sunnyvale, CA and Magna, UT; while the rest will be executed at various other locations across the United States. The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 as well as fiscal 2017 weapons procurement, research, development, test, and evaluation funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.Notably, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile is a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.With frequent missile threats that the United States has been receiving from North Korea, in past few months, a subsequent rise in contracts from Pentagon related to enhancement of the nation’s missile security has been observed. In particular missile-makers Raytheon Company as well as Lockheed Martin has been winning ample orders to this end.Given Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, Lockheed Martin has been securing valuable contracts for this product, like the one worth $419 million it won last month. This, along with the latest contract win, is expected to boost the company’s Space Systems business.Moreover, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up about 14.1% in last six months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 19.6%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

242,HII,"With the United States accusing Pakistan of playing a ""double game"" with respect to fighting terrorism, the U.S. Aerospace & Defense space has seen a thrilling start to 2018. Per Reuters, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s statement to withhold aid worth $255 million to Pakistan clearly shows that the White House might be looking to build pressure on the country.Defense stocks moved north following escalating tensions between the nations, with the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace index rising 0.6% on Jan 2. Major defense companies like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation have gained 0.7%, 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively.Defense Eclipses Tech As WellBefore picking defense stocks which are likely to excel in 2018, let’s take a quick look at how these stocks have performed in 2017. Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector have rallied 38.2% in 2017, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index's 19.8% gain.  A comparison with the Tech sector, which has fared well all through 2017, also places Aerospace & Defense stocks at an elevated spot. Notably, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector has returned 27.2% in 2017, lagging the Aerospace Sector.  Considering the solid rally of 2017, let’s discuss factors that will warrant an outperformance by aerospace and defense stocks in 2018 as well.Will the Rally Continue?There’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has been a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.Courtesy of these developments, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.In the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion. While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, on the other hand Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Additionally, emerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.The Winning StrategyIn order to save investors the time-taking process of identifying key winners that crushed the market and are likely to gain further, we have created a screen using the Zacks Stock Screener.Herein, we have zeroed in on three Aerospace stocks, which have been recording better-than-expected results and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10% or more.

243,HII,"With a major overhaul in tax laws in more than 30 years, U.S. corporates are expected to see a significant increase in their cash pile. While the slashing of the corporate tax from 35% to 21% will lead to a rise in profit after tax, a cash repatriation window will allow multinational corporations to bring in cash stashed in foreign countries. Boosted by the surge in domestic cash, many companies may opt for mergers & acquisitions (M&A), share buybacks or dividend pay-out next year or beyond.Here we will focus on stocks, which are expected to pay better dividends in 2018 than their industry peers and also have growth prospects. While the upside momentum of the market may continue amid strong manufacturing data, rising corporate profits and interest rates, risks of a downside remain. In such an environment, investors can add these stocks to their portfolio to enjoy a steady stream of cashGenerally, companies paying dividends are financially stable accruing profits in established markets. Share buyback programs and dividend payouts boost investor confidence in the company, thereby raising its market value. However, with interest rates rising in the United States, some amount of cash may flow to the debt market. However, this does not weaken the prospects of dividend investing. With investors getting worried about the Bull Run and many even expecting a correction, dividend paying companies are better bets for 2018.7 Amazing Dividend StocksIt is no easy task to select outperformers given the vast size of the market. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, we are also taking into account VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. With our Style Score system, we have identified stocks that have potential to beat the market.The score allows one to streamline their search to select winners by eliminating the negative aspects. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, we have chosen large-cap companies. This lowers the risk of the portfolio as these companies are less susceptible to market volatility. Moreover, the companies have seen EPS, sales and dividend payout increase in the last five years. Although, past growth is not an indicator of future movement, it helps to select companies that have a higher probability of paying dividends. The companies have also performed better than the S&P 500 this year. However, these have a low PEG ratio, which suggests room for upside.Here are seven of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells computer, networking, and communications platforms worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rose 6.1% in the last 90 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next years are 19.51% and 1%, respectively.

It is used to provide submarines with high capacity communications in extremely high frequency and super-high frequency bands and enables reception of the global broadcast service. Raytheon’s Space and Airborne System unit designs and develops the SATCOM system.Our ViewThe company’s Space and Airborne Systems registered $4,760 million of net sales in the nine months ended September 2017, compared with the year-ago figure of $4,582 million.

245,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a $945-million modification contract for exercising production option of fiscal 2018 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. The deal includes delivery of 54 U.S. Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles, 24 Qatar MSE missiles, 130 Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) missiles and other associated ground support equipment.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Operations related to the contract will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL; Huntsville, AL; and Huntington Beach, CA.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2010, 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Jan 31, 2021.A Brief Note on PAC-3 MissilesThe Patriot Advanced Capability-Three (PAC-3) missile system is a long range, air-defense and medium to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.Per Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor employs a two-pulse solid rocket motor that boosts altitude and range. The company projects strong demand for this advanced missile system, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.Our ViewWith rising geo-political tension around the globe, nations are strengthening arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade their defense systems. Defense equipments, in particular missile systems, have been witnessing improved traction recently, courtesy of the ongoing conflict between North Korea and the United States. Considering the fact that Lockheed Martin is a renowned missile-maker and Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, the company has been winning major contracts, in recent times.Evidently, in the third quarter, the State Department approved the sale of THAAD anti-missile defense system worth $15 billion, which will allow Saudi Arabia to purchase 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launchers and 360 missiles, as well as fire control stations and radars. The contract is likely to bolster the company’s long-term growth.In the third quarter, the company also won a contract worth $900 million for delivering LRSO cruise missiles, designed to infiltrate and survive integrated air defense systems and prosecute strategic targets.These contract wins came on the back of increasing prospects in the missile market. In line with this, the rocket and missile market is projected to reach $70 billion during 2017-2022 at a CAGR of 4.7%, as per Markets and Markets research firm.Such estimates for missile market may have made induced Lockheed Martin’s management to raise 2017 sales outlook for three business segments, including Missiles and Fire Control, by a collective $550 million. The raised view was supported by higher expected volumes. We believe, rising demand for missiles in the global space along with the procurement of major contracts, like the latest one, will enable the company to successfully achieve its enhanced sales targets, in the upcoming days.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s shares have returned about 28% in a year compared with the broader industry’s rally of 44.2%. The underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Aerospace sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc.

Work locations and funding related to the deal will be determined with each order.A Brief Note on Land SystemsGeneral Dynamics’ Land Systems unit is a global leader in the design, engineering, production, support and sustainment of tracked and wheeled land combat military vehicles such as Main Battle Tanks, Light Armored Vehicles, Armored Fighting Vehicles, MRAPS and Weapon Systems.Its other products include the Stryker infantry combat vehicle and gun systems, LAV family of combat and reconnaissance vehicles and mine resistant ambush protected vehicles.Our ViewWith widespread geo-political tension around the globe, all nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade land combat military vehicles. This will benefit General Dynamics to witness robust growth since it is one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.General Dynamics’ Abrams tanks provide troops with a proven decisive edge. In addition, survivability, mobility, adaptability and maintainability are important features of the tank. These capabilities make the tanks formidable. The company is the only producer of this tank in the United States, while Abrams is the only battle tank used by the U.S. military.General Dynamics enjoys a strong international customer base for its Abrams tank, with countries like Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Iraq being the primary customers. Surely the latest move to upgrade these tanks will encourage international customers to modernize their existing battle tanks fleet, which in turn will invite more foreign contracts for General Dynamics.The company intends to continue with this legacy but at lower operational and support cost. It also plans to extend service life of these tanks to 2030 and bolster the M1A1’s capabilities in urban operations. With the current U.S. administration in favor of scrumptious defense spending as well as the huge demand that the Abram fleet of tanks already enjoy in the global space, we expect the company to win more such contracts from Pentagon.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics stock has moved up about 15.7% over a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.2%. This underperformance may have been caused due to the budget cuts made by the prior government and the intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc.

247,HII,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)—whose technology was part of the agreement—Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) will all likely benefit.And recently, the industry has undergone a small wave of consolidation. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) announced a major $30 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report), creating one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufactures. Not long after, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) said it would be buying Orbital ATK  in order to expand and increase its defense footprint; Orbital notably holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket.As defense stocks and funds like the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) continue to gain this year, let’s take a look at three top picks for your portfolio.Engility Holdings Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, Engility Holdings provides government services in engineering, professional support, and mission support to customers in the U.S. Department of Defense, federal civilian agencies, and allied foreign governments. Its innovate solutions range from offering views of battlespaces to airborne platforms to providing advanced communications to support first responders, among many other services.Engility is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past seven quarters, boasting an average earnings surprise of 23.5%. Looking ahead, Engility expects year-over-year earnings growth of nearly 40% for the current year, with three positive revisions in the last 60 days. Sales, however, are expected to dip about 5% in the same time frame, but should bounce back by next fiscal year.Shares of EGL have had a quiet 2017 so far, but the company sits in a strong industry; Aerospace-Defense is in the top 23% of all industries ranked by Zacks, and has returned well over 38% year-to-date. Engility reports its next quarterly earnings in early November.Northrop Grumman Corp.Northrop Grumman provides innovative solutions in systems integration, defense electronics, and information technology for the U.S. and international militaries, government and commercial customers, as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or preferred supplier. Northrop is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Northrop has started off strong in 2017. Both its earnings and revenue figures for the second quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and it looks like the rest of the year will continue to see improved growth. Northrop expects year-over-year earnings growth of about 14% for the current year, and sales growth of about 3.18% for the same time frame; nine analysts have revised their earnings estimate upward in the last 60 days compared to none lower.Northrop also has a history of beating expectations, soaring past consensus estimates over the past four consecutive quarters. The defense contractor has an average earnings surprise of almost 12.6%. Like Engility, the company resides in the Aerospace-Defense industry. Northrop is set to report its next quarterly earnings on October 25 before the bell.Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)Known for designing nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, Huntington Ingalls Industries develops and produces warships like destroyers, amphibious transport dock ships, and national security cutters. The company also provides complex nuclear project management, and is based in Newport News, Virginia.Shares of Huntington have gained well over 24% year-to-date, and the Aerospace-Defense player is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. Looking at its current year, Huntington expects earnings growth of over 14% on sales growth of just 3.8%; four analysts have revised their earnings estimates upwards in the last 60 days compared to none lower. Historically, the company has seen EPS growth of 30.7%, and next fiscal year should see Huntington continue its earnings growth trend.Huntington has an average earnings surprise of about 8.5%, and is expected to report its next quarterly earnings on November 8 before the bell.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

248,HII,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage”, which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Lithia Motors, Inc. (LAD  -  Free Report), which operates automotive franchises, and retails new and used vehicles, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 19% for 3-5 years.

249,HII,"General Dynamics Corp’s (GD  -  Free Report) Mission Systems business recently won a contract for the procurement, manufacturing, testing and delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR) systems. The defense major will also supply high frequency distribution amplifier group components, spare parts and engineering services to support field and maintenance work.Closer Look at the DealValued at $198 million, the contract was awarded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, CA. Work will be executed in Scottsdale, AZ, and is scheduled to be over by Dec 2022.General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to complete the work. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $209 million, if the options included in the contract are exercised.Details on DMR SystemsDMR is a modular, software defined reprogrammable radio system with embedded cryptography that provides all radio frequencies (RF) to-baseband and baseband-to-RF conversion functions required for line-of-sight (LOS). It offers multiple waveforms and multi-level information security for voice and data communications using frequencies ranging from 2.0 megahertz to 2.0 gigahertz.Notably, General Dynamics’ AN/USC-61 (C) DMR is the first software defined radio to become a communications system standard for the U.S. Military.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics’ Mission Systems unit is a leading integrator of mission critical C4ISR solutions across the land, sea, air, space and cyber domain. This unit falls under the company's Information Systems & Technology (IS&T) segment, which offers high-assurance mission and display systems, signal and sensor processing and command-and-control solutions for airborne platforms. Its aircraft mission computers are installed in the Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighter and Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier II aircraft, providing pilots with advanced situational awareness and combat systems control.Currently, the company’s DMR operates overseas on the U.S. Navy surface and sub-surface vessels, fixed-sites and other Department of Defense communication platforms. Although IS&T segment revenues declined year over year in the third quarter of 2017, management forecasts strong fourth-quarter results from this segment. This may have been driven by expectations of strong DMR demand. The latest contract win is reflective of this bullishness.Considering the favorable defense budget scenario in the United States, we expect General Dynamics to win more such contracts, which in turn will boost the IS&T segment further.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have rallied about 13.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 34.8%. Budget cuts by the prior government have probably led to the underperformance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. ((HII  -  Free Report)). While Curtiss-Wright sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Leidos Holdings and Huntington Ingalls carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

250,HII,"U.S. stocks continue to extend their winning streak with the S&P 500 carving its sixth straight record close on Oct 5, the longest since June 1997. The market value-weighted index also completed its eight-day long winning streak, the longest since 2013. The broad index has posted its 43rd record close in 2017 so far and is up 350% from the low hit in March 2009. In fact, the index has more than doubled in the decade ever since its pre-crisis peak of October 2007.So, what has driven the S&P 500 higher? Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution. Renewed optimism over tax cuts propelled the buying of assets perceived as risky, including financial and tech stocks.Investors’ sentiments were also buoyed by narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and rebound in exports, which might boost the economy in the third quarter. The U.S. economy is already growing close to the range projected by the White House, while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in fundamentally sound stocks listed under the S&P 500 seems judicious.House Passes $4.1-Trillion BudgetThe House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much awaited tax code later this year. The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains $1.1 trillion in non-entitlement outlays, including nearly $622 billion for defense.The far-reaching plan will trim taxes for individuals as well as corporates. The tax plan aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%, while the corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. These tax reforms will put the economy in overdrive, which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above $20 trillion.Republicans’ major tax bill, known as budget reconciliation, required a simple majority in the Senate. The final tally was a narrow 219 to 206, with majority adopting the House of Representatives’ version of the budget.Financials and Technology Led Advancers in the S&P 500 Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Banking on such optimism, shares of banks scaled north.Among tech behemoths, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Oracle ORCL and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas. The tax plan seeks to encourage such multinationals to bring those profits back to the United States by cutting the tax rate. Shares of these companies scaled higher, with Netflix turning out to be the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, ending the day 5.4% higher at $194.39.Other sectors, including telecom, consumer staples and consumer discretionary, that tend to pay more to Uncle Sam also benefitted immensely.Investors Happy on Solid Economic DataThe U.S. international trade deficit fell by nearly $1 billion in August from July, while exports rose slightly to $128.9 billion in the month. This is quite encouraging as analysts had feared that hurricanes might affect trade data for August, with exports delayed due to storms.The U.S. GDP, in the meanwhile, expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States also scaled a 13-year high in September, while non-manufacturing activity picked up to a 12-year high. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. The non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month from 55.3% in the prior month.5 Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy NowWith the S&P 500 scaling record highs on tax cut hopes and a strengthening economy, investing in sound stocks from the index seems a prudent choice. We have, thus, selected five stocks that have not only gained immensely in the last two decades but also have the potential to move further north. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

253,HII," Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.The aviation electronics maker posted in-line earnings in the last quarter. Impressively, Rockwell Collins surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.61%.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Rockwell Collins' quarterly results.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Rockwell Collins is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.43%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Rockwell Collins carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayRockwell Collins remains the foremost global supplier of communications and avionics equipment for both commercial and military customers. The company’s balanced exposure to both types of customers allows it to use government funding to develop products for the dual-end market.Particularly, the $700-billion defense bill policy has improved the outlook for defense stocks like Rockwell Collins manifold. Evidently, its share price gained 5.6% since Senate approved the bill, last September.In the same month, Rockwell Collins entered into an agreement to be acquired by United Technologies Corporation for $30 billion. The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.Notably, shareholders of Rockwell Collins will be given all-cash consideration of $140 per share, reflecting a premium of nearly 7.5% from the company’s closing price of $130.29 on Sep 1, 2017. Interestingly, shares of Rockwell Collins is presently trading near the acquisition price but has not yet attained it. Considering this, investors even now have a possibility of gaining from this stock.Moreover, even after announcement of its takeover, Azerbaijan Airlines selected Rockwell Collins in November 2017, to provide its global, high-speed broadband in-flight connectivity, overhead in-flight entertainment and a full suite of advanced avionics — including Rockwell Collins’ MultiScan ThreatTrack weather radar — for 10 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.We believe this contract will boost the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.9 billion reflects a solid annual surge of 66.6%.This shows the huge demand that Rockwells Collins’ products enjoy worldwide and is thus a treasured acquiree in the Aerospace-Defense industry.Moreover the company’s B/E Aerospace buyout, which it completed in April 2017, has been adding value to its top and bottom-line growth since then. In fiscal 2017, its U.S. sales improved 18% as a result of improved accretions from this takeover. In line with this, we expect this acquisition to boost the company’s earnings in the first quarter as well and thus our consensus estimate for earnings of $1.53 per share reflects an annual growth of 27.5%.Rockwell Collins, Inc.

254,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 29, before the opening bell.Order procurement continues to be a primary growth driver for this defense major’s fourth-quarter results. The company is expected to overcome the weakness in operating profits in the quarter to be reported.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Lockheed Martin’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins: Key CatalystBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from the Pentagon and its overseas clients, courtesy of its varied defense and military product offerings.Among the contracts that this defense major won in the fourth quarter, the significant ones include a $7-billion deal for its Aeronautics business division secured for offering comprehensive F-22 air vehicle sustainment, a $945-million contract for the production of PAC-3 Missiles, and a $419-million modification contract for the procurement of Trident II (D5) missile production.The company also won a $260-million modification contract to upgrade four P-3B aircraft and a $158.5-million contract for the second phase of the German Navy P-3C Mission System Refresh program.Such a steady flow of orders will certainly boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $14.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.27%.Operating Profit: A Solid ShowDuring the third quarter, Lockheed Martin’s segment operating profit suffered timing-related shortfall. However, the company's fourth-quarter results are expected to show an improvement in the same. Impressively,management has raised the 2017 operating profit outlook by $20 million and total operating profit view by $240 million. In particular, the company lifted its profit outlook for Aeronautics, Space Systems as well as Missiles and Fire Control segments by a collective $35 million. For the Rotary and Mission Systems unit, the company foresees a drop in operating profits.In line with this, our consensus estimate predicted 16.3% growth in fourth-quarter operating profit for Aeronautics business segment. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, management has raised the sales outlook for the company’s Space Systems, Rotary and Mission Systems as well as Missiles and Fire Control business units. However, the sales outlook for theAeronautics business was slashed owing to an updated forecast of subcontractor production costs that were incurred in previous quarter.On the bright side, Lockheed Martin lifted its earnings per share outlook by 55 cents based on the increase in segment operating profits and the improvement in unallocated items. In line with this, the ZacksConsensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.06 per share, reflecting a 24.9% increase year over year.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation Quote What Our Zacks Model UnveilsLockheed Martin has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of +0.31%.

255,HII,"A company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations, meeting obligations and expanding business; with capital being one of the basic factors of production. Although there is option for equity financing, a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity. This is because debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity, especially in periods of low interest rates.Interestingly, the U.S. — the world’s richest economy — is the biggest borrower as well. In fact, according to the FY19 Federal Budget, at the end of FY18, gross U.S. federal government debt is estimated to be $21.09 trillion, more than double the debt load in the last decade.No one voluntarily wishes to be part of a debt-ridden nation. This is because debt brings with it the burden of interest payments.Then again, this should not dissuade one from investing in U.S. stocks. After all, in spite of such high debt levels, the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP, representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figures.The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt.Therefore, the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently, avoiding those with high debt loads. So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popularAnalyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q3 reporting cycle well behind us, companies that recorded higher earnings growth will attract investors on probabilities of outperformance in Q4 as well. But if such companies bear high leverage, they might not generate satisfactory returns. This is because during economic depressions, debt-ridden companies are prone to falling into a debt trap.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen.EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report): This corporation is engaged in design, integration, installation, start-up, testing, operation and maintenance of complex mechanical and electrical systems. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 16.96% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report): The company designs, builds and maintains nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and provides after-market services for military ships around the globe. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 14.22% in the trailing four quarters.Lam Research Corp.

256,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Ordnance and Tactical Systems secured a contract worth $14.7 million for supplying machine gun barrels. The deal has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, Warren, MI.Details of the DealPer the three-year contract with no option periods, the machine gun barrels will be used by the U.S. Army.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 24, 2021. It will be executed in Vermont and will utilize Army working capital funds of fiscal 2018 through 2021.Regular OrdersGeneral Dynamics holds a strong position in the domestic as well as international defense space. In fact, Huntington Ingalls Inc (HII  -  Free Report) and this defense major are the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. Also, General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. This, in turn, allows the company to win notable contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies.Last month, General Dynamics secured a modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets. Again, in September, it had clinched a $341.2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines. Also, a $5.1 billion special incentives contract has been awarded to General Dynamics for completing the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Going forward, we expect such awards to bolster the company’s revenue growth.Defense Scenario Driving OrdersWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the U.S. Aerospace-Defense industry with the nation being the largest weapon supplier. Again, the growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times.Furthermore, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the days to follow.In July 2017, the U.S. House passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion. The bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. If approved, it is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Our TakeGeneral Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the leading commercial disposer of explosive materials and devices in the United States. Also, it is one of the leading manufacturers of mortar weapons and systems, bomb bodies and propellants. This unit falls under the General Dynamics Combat Systems segment.During the third quarter of 2017, the Combat Systems segment generated 13% revenue growth year over year. We can expect consistent growth in the segment's top line, going forward. The improvement is anticipated to be driven by strong demand for its products and frequent contract wins.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 17.3% in a year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 35.9%. This may have been caused by the fact that the company is witnessing declining backlogs in recent times.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

257,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment recently secured a contract for providing U.S. and U.K. Trident II (D5) Strategic Weapon System Shipboard Integration Increment 8 as well as Columbia and Dreadnought efforts for the navigation subsystem. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $154.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Program, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Mitchel Field, New York and Huntington Beach, CA. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds, U.K. funds as well as fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task.Through this contract, the company will provide the required navigation hardware and software design, testing, installation and deliverables for the shipboard integration increment. It will also deliver correlating fleet support services for the current fleet ballistic missile navigation subsystem.In particular, the contract will provide U.S. and U.K. Inertial Navigation System and gyro modification and repair, Columbia navigation subsystem development and material procurements, modernization efforts for shipboard integration program, including U.S. and U.K. trainer maintenance and development. Also, long lead material procurement for Ohio and Vanguard transducers and long-range software modernization activities along with a portable data collection system will be delivered.Our ViewLockheed Martin's RMS business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. The business supports the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy and Missile Defense Agency of the United States, as well as intelligence, civil, commercial and international military customers.Although, during third quarter 2017, the RMS unit witnessed sales growth of a mere 0.2%, management has raised its 2017 sales outlook for this segment. This indicates growth prospects for the unit in the fourth quarter, in which contracts like the latest one will play a major role.Additionally, per a report by Markets and Markets research firm, the rocket and missile market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.7% during 2017-2022 to $70 billion. This growth can be attributed to the increasing geopolitical conflicts, war and terrorism, which are driving the demand for rockets and missiles globally. Considering the fact that Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, boasting a high demand, we expect Lockheed Martin to win more such contracts associated with it. This, in turn, will enable the company to capture larger shares in the expanding rocket and missile market.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up about 27.4% in a year compared with the broader industry's gain of 43.1%. This underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the Aerospace sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

258,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corp. ((LMT  -  Free Report)) recently secured a contract for providing cyber security support services to sustain the analysis, design, development, test, integration, deployment and operation of information technology systems and services for the cyber security workforce. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2022.Valued at $77.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA. Majority of the work will be carried out in China Lake, CA. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 working capital funds (Navy) to partially finance the deal.Cyber Security SolutionsLockheed Martin is a leading provider of a full spectrum of cyber capabilities supporting the defense and intelligence community customers. The company offers cyber security solutions to defend and exploit enterprise IT networks, radiofrequency spectrums, and military platforms on land, sea and air.The company’s Cyber Kill Chain framework is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense model built for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions and enriches an analyst’s understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.Our ViewFor the U.S. Navy, cyber security is critical because its ability to coordinate ships, planes and personnel depends heavily on computer networks and satellites. This paves way for a big defense contractor like Lockheed Martin to deliver extensive cyber solutions which enable the U.S. Defense to manage cyber intrusions, insider threats and supply chain vulnerabilities.Meanwhile, the fiscal 2018 budget allocated $1.5 billion to Homeland Security for countering cyber attacks, strengthening networking surveillance systems and protecting critical data-based infrastructure. This in turn is expected to help the company clinch more contracts related to cyber security.Notably, the company’s Rotary and Mission Systems business that offers cyber security solutions witnessed a mere 0.2% top-line rise in the third quarter of 2017. Despite this inappreciable top-line improvement, the company has raised its 2017 sales outlook for this business unit. We may expect this enhanced guidance to have been driven by anticipations of more such contract wins like the latest one.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied about 25.5% in a year compared with the broader industry’s 34%. This underperformance was primarily led by intense competition in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector includes Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. ((LDOS  -  Free Report)) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

Evidently, during the first nine months of 2017, the company paid $82 million worth of dividend, up from $70 million a year ago. In November 2017, the company announced a quarterly dividend hike of 20% to 72 cents per share.Going forward, based on its strong cash generating capabilities, the company continues to expect to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividend hikes of at least 10% annually.Being the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the United States, over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships.

Moreover, Huntington Ingalls continues to urge both the Executive Branch and the Congress to support investment in defense sector in 2018 and beyond, which will efficiently leverage its profitable production lines.Going forward, Huntington Ingalls projects to invest approximately $1.5 billion by 2020 to strengthen its core shipbuilding business.

260,HII,"Leverage, in particular financial leverage, is the amount of debt that an entity uses to buy more assets. In corporate finance, debt financing is a well-known term, which is used as a tool by companies to ensure smooth business operations. Since companies have limited funds, they need exogenous funding to boost their financial resources from time to time for expansion of operations.Even with the option for equity financing, companies prefer borrowing funds as these are easily and cheaply available. Moreover, using financial leverage rather than acquiring more equity capital is favored as equity financing reduces the earnings per share of existing shareholders.Yet the word “debt” is unnerving for many.  This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more, it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future.  In fact, the related amount of interest expense may overwhelm the borrower if it does not earn sufficient returns to offset the interest expense. This is a particular problem when interest rates rise or the returns from assets decline.Also when theamount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant, it poses greater risk. In fact, companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt.Considering this and the fact that analysts are currently estimating a hike in U.S. interest rates at the upcoming Fed meet this month, investors may feel shaky. Nevertheless, this does not indicate that one should totally dissuade from equity investment.What investors need now is tochoose stocks prudently, avoiding those with high debt loads. So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap. Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.As we approach the end of Q4, the growth picture seems to be improving compared to what we saw in the year-ago quarter. Naturally, this would entice investors to pour money in stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But in the uncertain world of investment, markets can trip anytime, particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage. Therefore, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen.Norbord Inc.

261,HII,"In the world of business finance, leverage refers to an investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to finance the expansion of the business, purchase of inventory and other assets as well as supporting other aspects of business operations. Now financial leverage is the amount of debt that exists in the capital structure of a company.While there exists option for equity financing, historically, debt financing has achieved more popularity among corporations when compared to equity financing. This is because, on availing debt financing, the company’s equity does not get diluted as a result of issuing more shares of stock. In other words, the borrower has no claim in the company’s shares.Yet, debt financing has got its own drawbacks. It tends to shoot up the company’s risk of bankruptcy.  This is because companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns.Nevertheless, this should not discourage one to invest in stocks. Instead, to be on the safe side, investors should measure the extent of financial leverage a company is bearing before putting their hard-earned money in its stock.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap.

262,HII,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.03%. Its Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to register substantial sales growth in the quarter under review. However, order flow is likely to fuel the company’s bottom-line growth.Let's see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Is Vertex Divesture a Prudent Move? Contract price modifications at Vertex Aerospace unit raised concern about L3 Technologies’ Aerospace Systems segment’s growth.  In fact, the company has identified this segment to be its most challenging business and remains skeptical about this unit’s growth rate as well as profitability.To focus its resources on higher value-added and more profitable business, the company decided to divest the Vertex Aerospace business, at the onset of the fourth quarter. However, the divesture is likely to drive the Aerospace Systems segment’s revenues in the long run and not have any impact in the fourth quarter.Management further added that several other financial pursuits of this segment will impact its 2018 sales growth. Therefore, the Aerospace Systems segment will most likely suffer a decline in sales year over year.Evidently, the Zacks consensus estimate for the segment’s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at $539 million reflecting an annual decline of 49.9%.Orders Growth ­– A Key CatalystA smooth order flow tends to boost the bottom line of defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Considering its encouraging order performance, the company’s enhanced its 2017 earnings guidance. Notably the company increased its EPS midpoint by 10 cents to $8.85, reflecting 8% growth over 2016.Primarily lower taxes and high interest income, along with the favorable contract performance in sensors and electronics businesses led the company to increase its full-year earnings guidance.Notably the Zacks consensus estimate for 2017 earnings is $8.38 per share, representing 2.1% annual rise.L-3 Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  L-3 Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. Quote Unimpressive Top-line Estimates ­It is imperative to mention that the top-line estimates for L3 Technologies, for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, are unlikely to register an annual improvement. The company’s fourth-quarter sales expectation of $2.8-$2.9 billion also reflects 6% decline in organic growth. Probably this prediction led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings of $2.31 per share to reflect 2.9% annual decline.For 2017, the company lowered its estimated international sales to organic decline of 7% and that's primarily due to new business delays taking place in aerospace systems unit.Will Communication Systems Unit Play a Spoilsport?L3 Technologies is currently consolidating two traveling wave tubes businesses in communication systems segment, which is scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018. As a result, this segment is incurring solid traveling wave tube business consolidation expenses, which may hamper its performance in the fourth quarter.In line with this, our consensus estimate for the unit’s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at $544 million, reflecting 6.5% annual decline.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not indicate that L3 Technologies will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of -2.04%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: L3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a Look Here are a few stocks in the Aerospace and Defense space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15.

263,HII,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 25 before the opening bell.We expect the Missile Systems business unit of the defense major to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the quarter. Moreover, its overseas business expansion is also expected to boost results. Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon’s quarterly results.Missile Systems Unit Driving GrowthSegment-wise, Missile systems business unit that represent almost 30% of the company’s total business sales continues to be a major growth driver. The fourth quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit.  Notably, the company won a modification contract worth $300 million for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles and another modification contract worth $304.2 million to procure 618 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-ground missiles, containers, component parts/support equipment (spares) and engineering technical assistance. Moreover, at the end of the year the company won a $634.2-million deal for manufacturing the 31st Lot of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. Such order wins indicate solid demand for missiles manufactured by Raytheon and in turn is expected to boost sales.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $2,219 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.1%.In fact, buoyed on this segment’s double-digit sales growth, our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $6.83 billion for Raytheon. This represents an annual improvement of 9.6%.For 2017, the company expects to witness sales growth of 10% for the Missile Systems unit, driven by higher sales volume.International Operations: A Major PositiveApart from its strong forte in domestic front, international business expansion has always been a primary growth driver for Raytheon. Japan having pursuing missile defense solutions to protect its homeland, has created growth opportunities for Raytheon. The company is currently co-producing SM-3 Block IIA missiles with Japan. Moreover, Raytheoncontinues to make progress on several large Patriot opportunities in Europe, while in the Middle East the company is additional demand signal for early warning sensing and missile defense products. We believe once the company reports fourth-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Other Factors to ConsiderApart from its strong forte in missile defense, the company also enjoys a leading position in offering cybersecurity, particularly on the domestic front. Notably, at the onset of the fourth quarter, the Government Accountability Office dismissed the protest surrounding the Domino contract worth $1 billion and Raytheon is now actively working with the Department of Homeland Security on this largest single cybersecurity contracts ever awarded. We may expect further gains from this contract to get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter sales.Such a steady contract securing expectation led the company to increase its 2017 booking outlook by $500 million. The company also enhanced its 2017 sales outlook, citing solid expectations for fourth-quarter results.In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $25.4 billion, reflecting annual growth of 5.8%.The company also raised its 2017 earnings outlook.  In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is at $7.61, reflecting annual growth of 0.8%.Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise  Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company Quote What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model show that Raytheon is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

The third quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit.  Notably, the company won a modification contract worth $615 million for manufacturing 17 Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missiles. Such order wins indicate solid demand for missiles manufactured by Raytheon and in turn is expected to boost sales.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales is $1,980 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.2%.Moreover, management earlier announced that it expects an  improvement in this segment’s margin in the second half of the year, starting from the third quarter. In this line, our consensus estimate for operating income of $267 million for this segment reflects an annual improvement of 13.6%; thereby hinting at possible operating margin rise in the to-be-reported quarter.International Operations: A Major PositiveApart from its strong forte in domestic front, international business expansion has always been a primary growth driver for Raytheon. The company is currently witnessing strong demand for varied product line not only from Middle East but also from Asia Pacific. In particular, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have emerged as new abodes for the company’s expansion. Europe also continues to be a major contributor to sales growth. We believe once the company reports third-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Other Contracts to Boost GrowthLike other defense bellwethers, Raytheon also won a number of contracts during the third quarter. Among the orders that Raytheon clinched, the significant ones include a $134-million modification contract for procuring Javelin containerized all-up rounds, command launch units, Javelin vehicle launcher-electronics and associated non-recurring engineering and a $119-million contract to support the Maritime Strike Tomahawk Program. It also won a modification contract of $127 million for procuring Excalibur Precision 155-mm Projectiles.It goes without saying that these contract wins will boost the company’s third-quarter sales. In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales stands at $6.3 billion, reflecting annual growth of 4.9%.Moreover, during second-quarter earnings call, Raytheon’s management raised its EPS guidance to reflect the company’s improved operating performance alongside expecting the bottom line to grow in the third quarter. In line with this our consensus estimate for Raytheon’s earnings is pegged at $7.90 per share, reflecting annual growth of 6.4%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Raytheon possess both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Raytheon has an Earnings ESP of +0.05%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.91, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90.

267,HII,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and contributes to strategic decision-making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and negative financial results. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but can’t accelerate enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is required to support the bottom line.But focusing solely on sales growth is not enough. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. Hence, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Sufficient cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Hunt Valley, MD, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (SBGI  -  Free Report) operates as a television broadcasting company. The company has long-term expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 2% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) provides group and individual disability insurance products and services. This Tarrytown, NY-based stock currently has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 7% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.

268,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 deliveries, wherein commercial shipments were up 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. However, defense shipments were 12% lower than the year-ago figure.Commercial DeliveriesThe year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by higher deliveries of 737 model. Boeing’s other models 777, 787 and 767 jets, registered marginal year-over-year drop in deliveries. In the reported quarter, the company delivered 202 airplanes.Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jets improved to 145 from 120 a year ago. Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners were 16 and 35 compared with 22 and 36 in the year-ago period, respectively. The company delivered two 767 jets compared with five in the year-ago quarter. Deliveries of 747 jets were four compared with five in the year-ago period.Year to date, commercial deliveries were 554 airplanes compared with 563 in the year-ago period.Commercial Order & Backlog A look at Boeing’s third-quarter order details reveals that the company booked 127 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects a drop from the year-ago figure of 150.At the end of third quarter, the backlog of commercial airplanes touched 5,679. This clearly indicates the dominance and popularity of Boeing in commercial aerospace. The customers are willing to wait for years to get delivery for the high quality aeroplane Boeing offers.Defense DeliveriesIt is to be noted that in the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 44 in the third quarter compared with 50 in the year-ago quarter. Total deliveries consisted of 18 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 11 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). In addition, the company delivered six F/A-18s, five P-8 models and four F-15s.Development in Defense SpaceWe expect that the new development in the defense space is likely to increase the defense orders for Boeing.The Senate has approved a $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which provides necessary funding to the U.S. Military to carry out activities in homeland and overseas. The bill authorizes $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.The new bill authorizes $2.9 billion for procuring 17 KC - 46A tankers, which is $400 million and two tankers more than the administration’s request. It also authorizes $3 billion for Army helicopters, including nearly $1.8 billion for different variant of Chinooks Helicopters. Boeing is going to directly benefit from this development.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has increased 93.4% in the last 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 52.3%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Our ViewBoeing anticipates that in next two decades, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion.We believe Boeing, with its high quality single-isle 737 model, is well placed to capture a large  share of the new orders of commercial jets.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Dynamics surpassed estimates in three of last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.67%.

269,HII,"Rising yields have somewhat dulled the appeal for dividend investing. Yet, stocks that consistently pay higher dividend are in vogue, as these tend to be high in quality and offer strong growth potential even in volatile patches.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 10 stocks that fit the bill:Owens Corning Inc. (OC  -  Free Report): This Ohio-based company is a world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions. It is expected to see earnings growth of 17.96% this year and has a P/E ratio of 18.28 versus the industry average of 19.28. Owens Corning has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Style Score of B.

270,HII,"Sensor systems maker FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) recently clinched a firm-fixed-price order worth $74.7 million to deliver TacFLIR surveillance cameras in support of the U.S. Army EO/IR-Force Protection (FP) program. The program offers enhanced perimeter security and force protection for U.S. troops stationed across the world.Per the order, the U.S. Army will purchase the systems through Army Contracting Command, Redstone. Under the same program, FLIR Systemshad secured an $8.8-million contract in third-quarter 2017, which required it to deliver other FLIR Ranger radars.  As part of this program, the company has delivered more than a thousand of these EO/IR sensors to the U.S. Army, including a variety of systems. The recent award substantiates its proven ability to rapidly deploy its technology for critical missions, as well as validates the effectiveness of its commercially developed, military qualified approach.The systems will be manufactured in Wilsonville, OR, with deliveries commencing in 2017 and scheduled to be completed in a year.FLIR Systems recently streamlined its operating structure to leverage its vertical integration as well as focus on core markets. The company has realigned six of its segments, namely OEM & Emerging Markets, Surveillance, Instruments, Security, Detection and Maritime into three units. The new segments will be called Government & Defense, Industrial and Commercial.Restructuring activities undertaken by the company since 2013 have helped the company reap synergies and drive profitable growth, combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions.Quarter to date, FLIR Systems’ shares have returned 5.4%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 2.6%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s solid execution and streamlined business have helped it drive improvements in backlog, margins, and net income, in recent times.We believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels indicate the company’s resiliency, which will enable it to sail through difficult economic times and drive growth. It should be noted that brokers are on the sidelines for the stock as its earnings estimates remained unchanged over the month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 also remained steady at $1.85 over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).

271,HII,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Huntington Ingalls has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level is significantly favorable with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.8. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Huntington Ingalls’s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past year.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Huntington Ingalls has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 19.7, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Huntington Ingalls has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P average, which comes in at 1.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Huntington Ingalls currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes HII a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Huntington Ingalls is 1.3, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.9. Clearly, HII is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Huntington Ingalls might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C. This gives HII a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The full-year 2017 has seen five estimates go higher in the past thirty days and none lower, while the full-year 2018 estimate has seen three upward revisions and no downward revision in the same time period.As a result, consensus estimate for 2017 has increased by 4.2% in the past month, while 2018 estimate has moved north by 1.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus | Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineHuntington Ingalls is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. A decent industry rank (top 39% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. Also, over the past one year, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

272,HII,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 19.5% for 3-5 years.

273,HII,"Defense major Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit secured a modification contract for providing engineering and interim logistics services as well as delivering spares and associated material, related to Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Work related to the deal is expected to be over by November 2020.Details of the DealValued at $92.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, CA.  Majority of the work will be carried out in Scottsdale, AZ.Fiscal 2018 weapons procurement (Navy); fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy); and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized incrementally to finance this deal.A Brief Note on MUOSMUOS is a narrowband military satellite communications system. It not only enables modern net centric communications capabilities but also supports legacy terminals for global customers. It has been developed for the U.S. Navy by Lockheed Martin.MUOS satellites are equipped with a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access payload that provides more than 10 times the communications capacity over the current Ultra High Frequency (UHF) satellite system. Each MUOS satellite includes a legacy UHF payload which is fully compatible with the current UHF Follow-on system and legacy terminals. Once operational, MUOS will provide 16 times the capacity of the legacy system it will eventually replace.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s  Space Systems segment designs and develops satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems like the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Space Based Infrared System, GPS-III, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-Series and more. Space Systems is responsible for various classified systems and services required for national security.With a rapid increase in militant activism, geo-spatial intelligence is the need of the hour. Lockheed Martin’s extensive systems help the Intelligence Community transform raw imagery and sensor data into layered, detailed maps. This helps troops, intelligence agents and emergency responders to address terrorism.In line with this, Global Military Satellite market, valued at $7.9 billion in 2017, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.50%, to value $10.1 billion by 2027 (per a Reportbuyer report).This indicates the solid growth prospects of this market in days ahead.Notably, geopolitical tension, all over the globe, is on the rise at present and is unlikely to subside any time soon. Thus prominent defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are expected to win more defense deals in relation to satellite communication securities from the government in coming days. A look at the company’s latest quarterly numbers also reflects the same. In particular, Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems segment generated revenues of $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting 18.5% of the total revenue.We expect solid inflow of contracts from Pentagon like the latest one will aid Lockheed Martin in maintaining the trend of putting up a solid performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.5% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 30.6% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, Lockheed Martin's performance lagged the likes of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) that have outperformed the industry.  Zacks Rank & Key PickLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same space is Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Leidos Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters with a positive average surprise of 14.81%. The company also has a solid long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

275,HII,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business unit, Newport News Shipbuilding, recently secured a contract for conducting engineered overhaul of fiscal 2019 USS Boise (SSN 764), from the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by February 2021.Details of the DealValued at $59.8 million, this assignment will be carried out at the company’s shipbuilding yard located at Newport News, VA. Notably this contract has a potential to reach a cumulative value of $385.7 million, if on exercise of options included in this deal.Per the terms of the agreement, Huntington Ingalls will be engaged in planning and execution of the overhaul process. Fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task.A Brief Note on USS BoiseUSS Boise (SSN 764) is a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. Notably, the Los Angeles-class forms the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine force.Nuclear Submarines & the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. Notably, the modern-day nuclear-powered submarines are markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.In the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). As a result both companies enjoy a large share of the market as well as high profit margins.It is imperative to mention in this context that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers like Huntington Ingalls in boosting production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How Will the Deal Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% and to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 47.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 45.3% gain. The company is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S. Over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships and the company continues to enjoy strong order growth from the U.S. Navy. This in turn may have led to the company’s aforementioned outperformance.  Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the aerospace-defense space are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boeing topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters with an average of 13.67%. The company has a solid long-term growth earnings growth of 13%.Northrop Grumman surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average of 12.60%. The company has a solid long-term growth earnings growth of 7.5%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

276,HII,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a contract for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1. It has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA.Contract DetailsPer the $240.2 million contract, Boeing will offer AWACS mission computing, navigation and communications upgrades as well as the next generation in identification, friend or foe enhancement designs. In addition, it covers foreign military sales to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Work will be carried out at Oklahoma City, OK and is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2019.A Brief Note on AWACSInitiated in 1977, Boeing’s AWACS was derived from its 707 model. Markedly, the company’s 707-320B and the E-3 airframe based system deals with command and control, and surveillance and communications activities for strategic and defensive missions. Also, it has been used by the U.S. Air Force, Japanese Air Self Defense Force, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, RSAF, the UK, and the French Republic.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and emerges by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog among its peers. In particular, the company’s key forte has been its combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.In September, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $600 million to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program. Again, it won a $676.6 million deal to offer full-rate production of six Lot 41 F/A-18E and eight F/A-18F aircraft. Going forward, we expect these recently won contracts to add impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Additionally, recent Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. This, in turn, might prove to be beneficial for defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have skyrocketed 93.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 54.4%. This impressive performance can be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

277,HII,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.87%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.70%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayL3 Technologies expects sales of roughly $2.7 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects about a 6% organic growth. While operating margin is anticipated to lie in the mid-9% range, earnings per share is projected to be between $1.85 and  $1.95. Again, free cash flow is forecasted in the range of $150 million to $200 million.However, the company expects Aerospace Systems segment to decline in the third quarter compared with the first half of 2017. This is primarily due to certain contract price modifications at Vertex sliding into the fourth quarter of 2016, and sales mix in Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) as well as aircraft systems.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects 3.12% year-over-year growth, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.69 billion, implying a 7.40% year-over-year improvement.L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

279,HII,"Last week, the Wall Street saw second-quarter earnings releases from a handful of the defense biggies like L-3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report), Raytheon Co. (RTN  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), to name a few. Notably, most of these corporations came up with an earnings beat this quarter.We have already crossed the halfway mark of second-quarter 2017 earnings, with 57.6% or 286 of the S&P 500 index members having released their earnings report as of Jul 28. Reported earnings were up 11.3% year over year on 6.1% higher revenues. Among them, 74.5% surpassed earnings estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.For the remaining 214 index members, combined with 286 members that have already reported, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5% higher revenues this season, compared to last year, with four of the 16 Zacks sectors witnessing growth in the negative territory.

280,HII,"Defense major Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract, under which it will upgrade four P-3B aircraft, to support the government of Greece. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by December 2023.Details of the DealValued at $260 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will offer structural mid-life upgrades, tailored-phased depot maintenance, a country-specific designed mission integration and management system as well as new avionics for the aircraft. Notably, the mid-life upgrade will extend the service life of each aircraft by 15,000 flight hours.Majority of the work for this contract will be executed in Marietta, GA and Schimatari, Greece. Foreign military sales (FMS) funds will be used to partly finance the deal.A Brief-Note on P-3BManufactured by Lockheed Martin, P-3B Orion is a four-engine airliner-sized turboprop-powered aircraft. It is used for anti-submarine and maritime surveillance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in major defense programs of the nation like F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter; C-130 Hercules; F-16 Fighting Falcon; F-22 Raptor; and C-5M Super Galaxy. Notably this segment is a primary growth driver for Lockheed Martin.Moreover, FMS has been a strong forte for its growth trajectory, with the company witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East regions. In line with this, in October, Lockheed Martin signed a deal worth $3.8 billion, with the Bahrain Defense force, under which the latter will buy 16 upgraded F-16 aircraft. Surely, the deal will boost Lockheed Martin’s sales at the Aeronautics business division. Notably, this segment recorded 14% sales growth in the third quarter. It goes without saying that such consistent inflow of contracts both domestic as well as overseas like the latest one for P-3B upgrades will provide further impetus to this division’s sales growth in the coming quarters. This in turn will allow the company to retain its position as the largest defense contractor of Pentagon.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 24.6% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 36.9% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, Lockheed Martin's performance lagged the likes of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) that have outperformed the industry.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

283,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3 before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 31.25%. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.04%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Huntington Ingalls is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and Huntington Ingalls has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +4.96%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.75, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Huntington Ingalls carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayBeing the U.S.’ largest military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls’ first-quarter 2017 results reported solid performance in shipbuilding, which is expected to reflect in the second-quarter results as well.In fact the company clinched quite a notable contract this quarter, which, in turn, is likely to boost second-quarter revenue growth. In particular, Huntington Ingalls won a modification contract worth $3 billion from the U.S. Navy to procure the detail, design and construction of the Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) Replacement (LHA(R)) Flight 1 Amphibious Assault Ship (LHA 8).The company’s CVN 72 Lincoln aircraft carrier fleet was being refueled and recapitalized in the beginning of the to-be-reported quarter, while management projected to redeliver it to the Navy by May 2017. We can expect further updates on this process once Huntington Ingalls releases its second-quarter results.On the flip side, management expects no near-term improvement in the company’s relatively weak working capital performance. This might weigh down on the soon-to-be-reported quarter’s outcome.                     The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.62, reflecting a 12.93% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1.79 billion, implying a 5.03% increase.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other defense stocks worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.Transdigm Group Inc. (TDG  -  Free Report) is expected to report quarterly results on Aug 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank #2.Leidos Holdings, Inc.

284,HII,"U.S. defense stocks have been witnessing significant upward trends, backed by factors like a growing international market for weaponries with more developing nations expanding their defense spending, the advent of innovative technologies in warfare and their increasing application as well as an increased demand for cost-efficient production. These, in turn, are also driving revenue growth in the broader Aerospace sector.Moreover, a favorable defense spending strategy endorsed by the U.S. administration has also been another primary force driving these stocks. Evidently, this July, the U.S. House passed the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion, which exceeded President Trump’s budget request.  Notably, the defense budget reflects a 10% hike from the fiscal 2016 level.The earnings picture for the third quarter of 2017 reveals a mixed bag in the near term. This is because the sector’s revenues are expected to improve 5% in the quarter, while earnings are expected to decline 13.7% (as of Sep 7, 2017). Nevertheless, considering the recent upward trajectory, in addition to the sumptuous flow of contracts from Pentagon, these numbers are most likely to improve as we proceed toward the next earnings season.Is North Korea Driving Defense Stocks?It is imperative to mention that the ongoing altercation between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has sent the major defense stocks rallying, of late.Notably, on Aug 9, Trump warned North Korea that if the nation does not refrain from its repeated missiles threats, the United States will respond with “fire and fury.” In retaliation, Kim threatened to fire missiles on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, which houses military bases.Consequently, while rest of the broader market reacted negatively to the escalated geopolitical tensions, defense stocks picked up pace. Next, at the end of the same month, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido Island before crashing in to the sea. This pushed the major defense biggies to new highs.Again, on Sep 3, North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. This once again rattled the broader stock market, as this nuclear test is the most severe foreign affairs emergency that the United States has witnessed in years.In retaliation, Defense Secretary James Mattis gave a strict warning to North Korea, saying that if North Korea does not refrain from such violent acts against the United States or its allies, then the country will have to face a massive military response.This time also, the U.S. defense stocks took a surge following the nuclear test, which indicated yet another major dispute between North Korea and America.3 Defense Stocks to BuyWe have hereby zeroed in 3 defense stocks, which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and promise long-term expected growth rate of 5% or higher, comparing favorably with the broader industry.

286,HII,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) won a modification contract worth $12.8 million, to provide yard services for CG-47-class cruisers and DD 963-class destroyers to the U.S. Navy. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2018.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, the company will provide long lead-time material procurement and management services for lifetime for both maintenance and modernization of these ships. The services include necessary engineering, technical, planning, ship configuration, data as well as logistics efforts.The contract was awarded by the Shipbuilding, Conversion, and Repair, Gulf Coast, Pascagoula, MS; and will utilize fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task at Pascagoula, MS.A Brief Note on CG-47 & DD 963USS Ticonderoga (CG 47) is an Aegis guided missile cruiser, jointly constructed by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report). Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Tomahawk missiles were deployed in these warships. These ships are equipped with Aegis Combat System which integrates the cruiser’s electronic sensors and weapons systems to engage anti-ship missile threats. Notably, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system, used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.On the other hand, built by Huntington Ingalls, DD 963 Spruance-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare, including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. It is designed to hunt down and destroy high speed submarines in all weather, but can also engage ships, aircraft, and shore targets. These multi-purpose combatants are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with Marine amphibious operations worldwide.Our ViewThe Department of the Navy (DON) proposed its base budget of $171.5 billion this May, for fiscal year 2018. Striving to restore Navy readiness through this budget, the DON requested $54.6 billion for operations and maintenance, funding 100% of projected ship depot maintenance. Surely this scrumptious budget boosted the prospects of Huntington Ingalls, which is one of the two primary military shipbuilders in the United States.Further, majority of the new eight ships allotted for purchase by the Navy in fiscal 2018, will come from either Huntington Ingalls or General Dynamics. This provided further impetus to the stock, as a result of which, the company has witnessed an 8% rise in its share price, since the budget was proposed.Although this budget proposal has not yet been approved by the U.S. Senate, we believe the recently won contract is indicative of the fact that the U.S. Navy remains firm with its focus toward modernizing its existing fleet of warships. If the budget proposal gets eventually approved, we can expect to witness more such contracts for Huntington Ingalls, in the coming days. This will surely boost the company’s profit level, which in turn is most likely to get reflected in increased earnings for shareholders.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 29% in a year, underperforming the industry’s 40.3% gain. This could be because of the earlier budget cuts which have put pressure on the top line. Also, investors remain concerned about budget deficits and political uncertainty that may make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankHuntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

288,HII,"Designer and manufacturer of thermal imaging systems, FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) managed to impress investors with second-quarter 2017 results, wherein its earnings beat estimates by 2.4%. Buoyed by positive industry trends and solid operational execution, the company expects to continue its earnings momentum on the back of complementary acquisitions and steady market traction of its recently launched products.We believe, a phenomenal performance by the company’s OEM & Emerging Markets segment as well as its Surveillance and Instruments segments bode well for growth for rest of the fiscal year. Moreover, the company enjoys a robust foothold in an expanding electronics market and has several growth drivers working in its favor.Read on to find out the key factors which make the company an attractive proposition for investors right now.Factors at Play FLIR Systems’ core strength in providing reliable and effective imaging along with threat-detection technologies has been bolstering growth momentum. Over the past couple of quarters, the company’s “Commercially-Developed, Military Qualified” (“CDMQ”) model has been quite popular in government and military markets, which has enabled it to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets. The company is likely bolster the prospects of its government business further using the model, consequently adding to its strength.FLIR Systems’ diverse portfolio has been a consistent growth driver, helping it mitigate weaknesses associated with any particular market. Over the past few years, the company’s solid execution and restructuring efforts have enabled it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted earnings per share have considerably benefited from such actions. We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters as well.Moreover, FLIR Systems’ strong commitment towards introduction of innovative products to expand customer base and enhance foothold in new markets is expected to boost the top line significantly. Since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a compound annual growth rate of 58% in total unit volumes. Going forward, we expect steady market traction of its newly launched products to help the company drive revenue growth in the respective segments. In addition, FLIR Systems’ keen eye for strategic acquisitions is expected to be conducive to inorganic growth. Its previously completed acquisitions including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics has strengthened presence in recreational, military weapon sights and scopes markets as well as full-spectrum end-to-end security system.HeadwindsHowever, FLIR System’s financials have been hurting from waning consumer spending and capital investments over the past few quarters. Strong competition from various big and small sector players including the likes of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) remain a threat to FLIR System’s profitability. Sluggish economic growth in many of its key markets is also expected to add to its challenges.Further, the company’s primary markets remain quite volatile. Multiple factors like timing, number and size of orders, variations in the volume, and shipments of orders pose significant risks for the company and are beyond its control. Further, the company’s operating margins are exposed to multiple seasonal fluctuations including contracting by the U. S. government and certain foreign governments, volatility of funding by customers and tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we believe its focus on business streamlining along with positive trends in certain business areas offer FLIR System modest growth opportunities.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

289,HII,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Lack of orders from Pentagon as well as international allies of the United States may hamper the company’s fourth quarter sales growth. Moreover, the Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to be a majorsupport for Northrop Grumman this time around.Let’s discuss the factors influencing the defense giant’s quarterly release.Will Aerospace Systems Remain the Key Contributor?The Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to growth.Usually, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft boosts sales at this segment. However, the segment managed to clinch very few contracts in the fourth quarter.This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s Q4 revenues, which stands at $2,861 million, reflecting an annual decline of 0.4%.Lack of Orders to Impact SalesDefense majors have been receiving a slew of contracts from the Pentagon and foreign U.S. allies, Northrop Grumman being no exception. However, in the fourth quarter, the company won a handful of notabledeals only like the $445-million Air Force contract to support LAIRCM program.Consequently, the Q4 revenue growth expectation is not very ambitious. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $6.37 billion, reflecting a 0.4% year-over-year decline.Other Factors to ConsiderThe Mission Systems business has been benefiting from increased volume for sensors and processing programs along with air and missile defense programs and Advanced Capabilities business. Considering acontinuation of this trend in the final quarter of the year as well, Northrop Grumman had slightly lifted the 2017 sales expectation for this unit during the third-quarter earnings call.Taking this into consideration, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s Q4 revenues is pegged at $2,906 million, reflecting annual growth of 2.1%.Meanwhile, unallocated corporate expenses rose $90 million in the third quarter, primarily on account of the Orbital ATK acquisition. As the transaction is still on track, we expect the company to incur higherunallocated corporate expenses in the fourth quarter as well.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation Quote Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows an earnings beat for Northrop Grumman this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy)or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.73, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75.

However, the negative earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the Aerospace-Defense sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) is expected to report quarterly results on Jan 31.

290,HII,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 24, before the opening bell.We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon will continue to drive the military shipbuilder’s revenues in the fourth quarter. However, Aerospace segment may face margin pressure in the quarter under review, as is evident from the expected annual decline in operating earnings.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.Order Growth to Boost SalesOrder flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth quarter sales is $8.4 billion, reflecting 2.5% year-over-year growth. Management also remained optimistic about the company’s fourth quarter order growth, which led it to project revenue growth of 15%, sequentially.Notably, the contracts that General Dynamics secured in the fourth quarter, include a $2.6-billion deal for upgrading 786 M1A1 configured Abrams vehicles in relation to the newly configured M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3; an agreement worth $198 million for the procurement, manufacturing, testing and delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR) systems.Moreover, the company’s business division, Electric Boat, secured a modification contract worth $432 million for providing fiscal 2018 lead yard services and development studies and design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.The contract wins throughout 2017 will surely bolster the company’s full-year revenues, as is evident from the 4.9% growth reflected by our consensus estimate for the full year.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteWill Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport?During second-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics’ management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year, citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport. In line with this, fourth-quarter consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,930 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.2%. Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 20.6% to $348 million, per our consensus estimate.Although the company continues to have a strong forte in the Gulfstream business, which exhibits strong pipeline growth, a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment’s overall fourth-quarter growth. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, other three business units of General Dynamics indicate positive annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.On the bottom-line front, a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to result in lower earnings. Evidently, our consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ earnings is pegged at $2.36 per share, reflecting 9.9% annual decline. The full-year earnings estimate of $9.81 per share also represents a 0.6% drop.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model show that General Dynamics is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%.

292,HII,"Leading aircraft manufacturer, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 25.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by constant contract wins and higher commercial deliveries. Meanwhile, lower defense deliveries are expected to reflect conflicting numbers.Let's have a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of orders for its commercial jets including a $2.16 billion order from Qatar Airways for two 747-8 Freighters and four 777-300ERs (extended range). Again, it announced that Turkish Airlines intends to purchase 40 787-9 Dreamliners, which are estimated to be valued at approximately $11 billion at list prices.Among the defense contracts won in the third quarter, the significant ones include a $600 million contract to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program. Again, it won a contract worth $323.5 million to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft. Boeing clinched a contract worth $222.5 million for eight CH-47F new build helicopters as well. Considering these defense orders, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion showed 0.8% sales growth in Integrated Defense System segment.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of orders will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales growth is pegged at $24.06 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%.Q3 Orders & Deliveries: A Mixed BagBoeing’s third-quarter deliveries showed a 7.4% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments were 12% lower than the year-ago figure. The year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries was primarily driven by higher deliveries of 737 model. Boeing’s other models 777, 787 and 767 jets, registered marginal year-over-year drop in deliveries. In the reported quarter, the company delivered 202 airplanes.Boeing’s third-quarter order details reveal that the company booked 127 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects a drop from the year-ago figure of 150. At the end of third quarter, the backlog of commercial airplanes touched 5,679.In the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 44 in the third quarter compared with 50 in the year-ago quarter.Operating Profit: A Positive PictureDuring its second-quarter earnings call, Boeing raised its total operating profit guidance for 2017.  Thanks to the huge number of commercial orders that the company won, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has predicted higher operating numbers for the third quarter. Commercial Airplanes segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $1,756 million, up 10% year over year.  Also, Integrated Defense System segment's operating profit expectation of $874 million reflects year-over-year growth of 11.5%.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Boeing this quarter.

293,HII,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon to drive the company’s revenues in the third quarter. However, Aerospace segment is expected to face margin pressure in the second half of the year, which is reflected in third-quarter sales estimate for this unit.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.String of Contracts to Boost GrowthA scrumptious order flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States tend to boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third quarter sales is $7.9 billion, reflecting 2.1% year-over-year growth.Notably, the significant contract that General Dynamics secured in the third quarter, include a $5.1-billion special incentives contract to complete the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs); a modification contract worth $115.3 million for offering additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts to support Virginia-class submarines and a contract worth $310.6 million to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteThe company also won a $341.2-million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines and another modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets.Being one of the top-notch submarine contractors in the nation, such contracts are expected to bolster the company’s Marine Systems segment’s growth. Evidently, our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems’ sales stands at $2,068 million, up 0.2% annually.Will Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport? During second-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics’ management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year, citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport. In line with this expectation, our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at $2,039 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.2%. Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 10.4% to $398 million, per our consensus estimate.Although the company continues to boast a strong forte in the Gulfstream business, which exhibits a strong pipeline growth, a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment’s overall third-quarter growth. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, other two business units of General Dynamics indicate higher annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.On the flip side, the company’s services business is expected to deliver weak performance due to slow execution of programs in several civilian agencies, owing to uncertainty and, in some cases, reduction in funding levels.For the to-be-reported quarter, our consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ earnings is pegged at $2.43 per share, down 2.14% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

294,HII,"Though rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend investing, a niche corner of this space is still in vogue. This is none other than the dividend growth strategy. Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those that pay high yields.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow.

295,HII,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in designing, building, overhauling, and repairing of ships, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 19.5% for 3-5 years.Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report), a non-traditional, discount retailer, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is currently pegged at 13.5%.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), a diversified health and well-being company, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is currently pegged at 13.5%.ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON  -  Free Report), the manufacturer and seller of semiconductor components for various electronic devices, has a VGM Score of A and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

296,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat Corp., has clinched a $341.2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines. Notably, the deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractElectric Boat will provide drawings and associated technical data, design change documentation, logistics technical data, configuration management as well assubmarine safety design review.The contractor will also offer hull, mechanical and electrical engineering, non-propulsion plant electrical system engineering, propulsion plant engineering, besides maintenance engineering.In addition, this subsidiary will give refit/availability technical support, on-site support, configuration change program design and installation support, configuration change program material support and submarine technical trade support.These apart, the company will also support training and facility, research, development, test and evaluation program, research and development of submarine/submersibles, miscellaneous special studies, temporary alteration support, modernization of submarine/submersible systems/subsystems and affordability/cost reduction technical support. Markedly, the dealincludes foreign military sales (FMS) to Spain.While majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT, the rest will be performed at a few other places across the United States. It will be completed using FMS and fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) as well as fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) fundsby September 2018.Nuclear Submarines and the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling. Currently, the U.S. Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.Notably, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States, operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). As a result, both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins.In this context, it is imperative to mention that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. The company is also a prime contractor for the development of Columbia-class submarines and Virginia-class submarines.Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Going forward, the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have surged 31.9% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%. This downturn might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government in the defense space.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report). While Leidos Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Northrop Grumman holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

297,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat Corp., has clinched a $5.1 billion special incentivescontract to complete design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).The contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractThe contract covers development of component and technology, efforts related to missile tube module and reactor compartment bulkhead prototyping and manufacturing, and United Kingdom Strategic Weapon Support System kit manufacturing for the Columbia class ballistic missile submarines.Notably, the deal has been was awarded to General Dynamics as its Electric Boat division currently owns the wholeworkforce of nuclear ballistic missile submarine design/engineering and data environment to support achievement of the highly specialized submarine design products and integration efforts required to meet all of the contemplated technical and schedule contract requirements.Majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT while the rest will be performed at Newport News and a few other places across the United States. It will be completed using 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2017 research, design, test and evaluation (Navy) and United Kingdomfundsby December 2031.About Columbia-class SubmarinesThe Columbia-class submarine program, formerly known as the Ohio replacement submarine program, was designed by the U.S. Navy to replace its existing force of 14 Trident-armed Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of 12 ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Originally built by Electric Corp., the Columbia-class submarines are operated by the United Kingdom, Russia, China, France and India.Under the Navy’s Submarine Unified Build Strategy (SUBS), the Columbia-class submarines will be jointly constructed by General Dynamics’ Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) Newport News division. Per the U.S. Navy’s request, General Dynamics continues to be the prime contractor for designing and building the Columbia-class boats.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. The company is a prime contractor for the development of Virginia-class submarines (another class of nuclear-powered submarine).Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the Columbia-class program as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Scenario Helping Industry GiantsThe growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests, along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times. Also, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favoured defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the long run.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding.

302,HII,"Defense giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Aerospace segment continues to be the major growth driver for Northrop Grumman. The company’s third-quarter results too is expected to be gain from the same.  Substantial inflow of orders from Pentagon for the company’s varied product offerings also remains a major catalyst.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Northrop Grumman’s quarterly results, in brief.Aerospace Segment ­– A Key CatalystAerospace Systems segment that fetch almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales is a primary contributor of the company’s quarterly growth.Notably, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft mainly boosts this segment’s sales growth. In the third quarter, the company won a number of contracts from the Pentagon in this regard.Among them, the significant one is an Army contract worth $117 million for offering logistics support services for government-owned fixed wing fleet performing special electronic mission aircraft missions.Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $2,928 million, reflecting annual growth of 12.9%.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteOrder Flows to Drive SalesDefense majors have been receiving a slew of contracts from Pentagon and foreign U.S. allies. Northrop Grumman too has been no exception in this regard. During the third quarter, the company’s notable contract wins include a contract worth $124.7 million to support the AN/APR-39 program, a $329 million Air Force contract for the Ground-based Strategic Deterrent and another order of $409 million for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program.Consequently Northrop Grumman is expected to gain from the number of contracts it has won in the third quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales is pegged at $6.3 billion, reflecting 2.6% year-over-year growth.Other Factors to ConsiderSegment-wise, Mission Systems business unit has been benefiting from the company’s successful cost-reduction initiatives. Considering this trend to continue in the second half of the year, Northrop Grumman has increased this unit’s annual sales expectation during second-quarter earnings call. Keeping this into consideration, we may expect the third-quarter results to reflect strong sales growth for this unit. Evidently, our consensus estimate called for sales of $1,156 million for Mission Systems, reflecting annual growth of 1%.On the flip side, increased unallocated corporate expenses and effective tax rate dented the company’s second-quarter earnings growth. Anticipating similar expenses to linger, our consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s earnings of $2.92 per share reflects 3.2% annual decline.Around the end of the third quarter, Northrop Grumman announced that it has agreed to acquire rocket-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. Although no direct impact of this deal will get reflected in the upcoming results, further updates from the transaction can be expected once the company releases its third-quarter report.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as we have mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -1.93%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.87, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a negative earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

303,HII,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $23.3 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for providing support services to the Minuteman III weapon system. Per the contract, the company will provide operations and maintenance, testing and technical data delivery support to the Minuteman III.Work related to the contract will be carried out at the Little Mountain Test Facility situated in Ogden, UT. Operations are expected to be concluded by Sep 30, 2023.About Minuteman III weapon systemBoeing has been one of the primary integrator for the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system since 1958. So far, the company has created, tested and deployed more than 1,800 Minuteman-series missiles for the Air Force.Since its inception in 1958, there have been a number of upgrades to the Minuteman III weapon system. The Minuteman system has been developed to meet new challenges and undertake new missions. The latest version – Minuteman III – is a part of the U.S. Strategic Command.Strong BacklogBoeing has earned the position of one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world in terms of revenue, orders and deliveries. It is a competitor to industry giants like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc (HII  -  Free Report) etc. The company receives regular orders from the Department of Defense (DoD).Backlog at the end of the second quarter was up to $482.2 billion from $479.5 billion at the end of first quarter. Reported backlog included $27 billion of net orders during the quarter.During the quarter, the company won a massive $1.1 billion, from the Missile Defense Agency (“MDA”) to procure Redesigned Kill Vehicle (“RKV”) development among all the other ones.Defense Scenario Helping in GrowthRecently, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Not just the United States, majority of nations in the world who are fighting against internal and external enemies are working hard to strengthen their defense system.All the above reasons put together will help Boeing and its peers in securing more contracts from different verticals of U.S. Defense and also from other allies of the United States.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 93.7% over the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 43.0%.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

304,HII,"Aerospace giant, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), has secured a modification contract to provide additional funding for the Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), Phase C for the F/A-18E/F aircraft.Notably, the SLAP and SLEP programs aid the extension of the service life of the F/A-18E/F jets beyond the original design of the 6,000 flight hours.Details of the DealValued at $42 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 30, 2021 and will be carried out in St. Louis, MS and El Segundo, CA.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. F/A 18E is a single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, which is about 25% larger than its predecessor, the F/A-18C/D, but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In particular, among other defense equipments, the company's key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, it has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Evidently, Boeing won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract  from the U.S. Air Force last week. The deal came up with a ceiling value of $499 million. Per the contract, the company will be responsible for providing quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. Again, last month, the company clinched a contract worth $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation. In this regard, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, the current budget scenario is favorable to the defense industry, which also buoys investors’ optimism. To this end, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill this July, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. The figure exceeded President Trump’s fiscal 2018 defense budget request proposed in March.If enacted, this budgetary amendment is expected to immensely boost Boeing and other defense major’s business in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 86.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 41.6%. This might have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. In addition, the company poses strong competition to its peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, sturdy performances of Surveillance and Instruments segments boosted the sales performance.As for the segments, OEM & Emerging Markets revenues continued their striking growth trajectory, rising an impressive 54.0% over the prior-year quarter to $87.4 million.

Revenues from the Instruments segment came in at $86.0 million, up 10% on a year-over-year basis.The Security segment’s revenues were down 22% to $49.7 million from the prior year, mainly attributable to a decline in Lorex-branded products.

307,HII,"Defense prime, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 7.45%. It is worth noting that Raytheon outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 5.16%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Raytheon has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.75, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, Raytheon’s combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and +0.58% ESP makes us reasonably certain of an earnings beat.Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Raytheon continues to retain its position as one of the large-cap defense giants in the U.S., thanks to its non-platform-centric focus. Strong demand for the company’s advanced combat-proven defense technologies from global customers as well as solid domestic bookings hint at an encouraging yet-to-be-reported quarter.Among the highlights of the second quarter, Raytheon clinched a few significant contracts, including a $200 million modification contract for procuring 317 of the 17th Lot of AIM-9X Block II missiles and a $113.2 million contract to supply engineering and technical services for Standard Missile to the U.S. Navy. Another notable one is the $617.6 million worth Navy deal to procure full-rate production requirements and spares for fiscal 2017 Standard Missile-2 (SM-2).On May 20, President Trump signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia – an agreement that came up with a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years. Although no contract value was released, as part of this arms package, Raytheon has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Saudi Arabia Military Industries Company to cooperate on defense-related projects and technology development.Also, the company will establish Raytheon Arabia – a wholly owned Saudi legal entity – to administer programs for creating indigenous defense, aerospace and security capabilities in the KSA. With the U.S. Department of State indicating a possible adoption of Raytheon’s Patriot missile system by Saudi Arabia, this arms deal is expected to boost the company’s sales growth in the days ahead.The company expects to generate sales in the range of $6.05–$6.20 billion. On the bottom-line front, management projects earnings in the band of $1.67–$1.71 per share.Moreover, the company expects the tax rate to be approximately 29.5% in the to-be-reported quarter, which will be lower than the full year’s projected rate, owing to the timing of the benefit associated with stock-based compensation.However, management expects to record a non-operating charge associated with the make-whole provision related to the early retirement of debt. This pre-tax charge of approximately $40 million will impact the quarter’s EPS by 9 cents.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.74 a share, reflecting a decrease of 0.57% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is $6.23 billion, implying a 3.17% year-over-year rise.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.General Dynamics Corp.

FLIR Systems has an average negative surprise of 2.6% over the trailing four quarters.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the about-to-be-reported quarter, marking an end to its unimpressive earnings surprise history.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows an earnings beat for FLIR Systems as it possesses the key components.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for FLIR Systems is +2.44% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 42 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.

The company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS have materially benefitted from such actions. We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton® thermal microcamera core, is expected to boost the top line significantly. Since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the first quarter – including X6900sc SLS, X8500sc SLS cameras and upgraded version of FLIR M-series thermal cameras – are expected to ramp up sales for the quarter under review.Moreover, FLIR Systems’ keen eye for strategic acquisitions is expected to be conducive to its inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost top-line performance. In addition, the company’s diligent CDMQ model is likely to compound the sales of its government and military business. Using this model, FLIR Systems has been able to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KLX Inc.

A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and Spirit AeroSystems has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +3.33 %. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.24, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Spirit AeroSystems carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayGrowing global demand for commercial airplanes is expected to boost sales of large aerostructures and components offered by Spirit AeroSystems. Moreover, the company’s long-term contracts with industry bellwethers like Boeing and Airbus Group should help boost revenues.During the first-quarter earnings call, Spirit AeroSystems announced that it is poised to ramp up the production rate on the Boeing 737 program from 42 airplanes per month to 47 per month, before the end of the second quarter. We may get further updates on this program once the company releases its results.On the flip side, Spirit AeroSystems incurred abnormal operating expenses of $12.1 million in fourth quarter of 2016 as well as additional expenses of $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Management expects some residual expenses from these to weigh down on the company’s second-quarter results, which, in turn, may mar its growth trajectory.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share reflects a 0.53% year-over-year decline, while sales are anticipated to be down 5.90% to $1.72 billion.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other defense stocks worth considering on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.Transdigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) is expected to report quarterly results on Aug 8.

The company is one of the two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the other one being Huntington Ingalls Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). This positions General Dynamics at a strategic advantage. Additionally, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have been in favor of the company’s business line.Earlier in August, General Dynamics’ business unit, Land Systems, secured a contract from the U.S. Army to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3. (Read More: General Dynamics' Unit Wins $311M U.S. Army Contract)The company’s business division, Electric Boat, was also awarded a $115.3-million modification contract to offer additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines from the U.S. Navy.

The company has been increasing R&D expenditures over the past three years. Notably, company-sponsored R&D expense increased 5.8% year over year to $418 million in 2016.The Defense ScenarioThere are multiple reasons which have boosted the defense sector in the recent times. Firstly, terror activities are constantly rising across the globe. United States and its allies are on high alert anticipating major threats and have been taking extra effort to strengthen their defense system.Secondly, the tension between the United States and North Korea is increasing. The conflict between these two countries has given a good boost to the major defense stocks like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls and others. The proposed 10% hike in the 2018 defense budget by President Trump is expected to rake in new orders to these giants.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have returned 29.3%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 32.2% in the last year.This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cuts will hurt the company’s growth prospects.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

311,HII,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry grabbed investors’ attention this week on the back of two significant developments. On Sep 5, defense stocks surged following North Korea’s ‘successful’ hydrogen bomb test — largest nuclear device test since 2006.The U.S. administration strongly condemned the act, wherein the U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea of dire consequences if the nation goes on encouraging such violent operations. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions from the United States.The finalization of the merger between United Technologies and Rockwell Collins however, dragged down defense stocks. The aerospace giant Boeing raised strong objections against the merger citing the deal’s potential to hinder competition in the aerospace supply chain market. This may have raised skepticism surrounding the deal.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace sector, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the red zone. Notably, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index dropped 2.6%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index dipped 2.3% during this period.Among last week’s highlights, defense primes Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK, Inc.  secured notable contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD). Moreover, Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized their merger deal.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Sep 1, 2017 here)A Look Back at Last Week’s Key Stories1.

312,HII,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business segment, Newport News, recently clinched a modification contract worth $105 million, for upgrading nuclear submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2019.Details of the DealThe contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Huntington will provide engineering, technical, design, configuration and database management as well as integrated logistics support for the ships. In addition, the company will also offer research and development, modernization and industrial support for submarines.The modification related task will be executed at the Newport News shipyard, located in Virginia. Huntington aims to utilize fiscal 2017 other procurement, fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation as well as fiscal 2015 shipbuilding and conversion funds to complete the project.Nuclear Submarines And the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling. Currently the Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.Notably, in the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). As a result both the companies enjoy a large share of the market as well as high profit margins.It is imperative to mention in this context that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How the Deal Will Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.Of late, the U.S. Navy has committed to design the Columbia class submarine as a replacement of the currently aging Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The Ohio class SSBN includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines. The Columbia class program currently has 12 ballistic missile submarines. The U.S. Navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarines, and in early 2017 the program has entered into the engineering and manufacturing development phase. As a subcontractor, Huntington will support General Dynamics to build modules for the entire Columbia class submarine program, with the first ship’s construction expected to begin in 2021. To this end, management at Huntington believes the Columbia class submarines hold significant growth opportunity for the company, in the days ahead.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 28.2% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s 37% gain. This could be because of the earlier budget cuts which have put pressure on the top line. Also, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. As a result, the company's performance lagged the likes of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) that outperformed the industry.Zacks RankHuntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

313,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the opening bell.We believe order procurement to be a primary growth driver for this defense bellwether’s upcoming third-quarter results. On the other hand, segment operating profit is expected to reflect conflicting numbers in the quarter.Let's have a detailed look at the factors influencing Lockheed Martin’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy of its varied military product offerings.Among the contracts this defenese major won in the third quarter, the significant ones include a $3.8 billion foreign military sales (FMS) deal for multi-year production of Black Hawk helicopters, a contract worth $409 million for Next Generation Thermal, Power, and Controls (NGT-PAC) program and a modification contract worth $5.6 billion to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.The company also won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract worth $499 million, another deal worth $900 million for the replacement of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile and a modification contract worth $548 million to support production requirement of a Hellfire II missile.It goes without saying that such steady inflow of orders will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Q3 sales growth is pegged at $12.83 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.04%.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteOperating Profit: A Mixed BagDuring its second-quarter earnings call, Lockheed Martin raised its total segment operating profit for 2017, citing improved expectations for Aeronautics business unit, for the remaining year.  Our consensus estimate also predicted numbers in line with this expectation. Thus this segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $535 million, up 23.8% year over year.However, the consensus estimate for the Space Systems business unit reflects an annual decline of 11.8% to $224 million, in contrast to an improved number expected by the company.Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise each of Lockheed Martin’s segments has positive sales growth expectation, in line with what management hinted last quarter. Our consensus estimate showed notable sales growth in all the three segments of Lockheed Martin in the third quarter.However in terms of bottom-line growth, expectations are not so bright for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $3.25 per share, down 9.9% year over year. Moreover, this estimate has declined by a couple of cents in past 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of -0.68%.

In his speech, Trump once again threatened Kim Jong Un’s regime with force if Pyongyang does not back down from its nuclear aspirations and cease its tests.“No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea,” President Trump said in his speech. “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea… It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.”On top of the possibility of some type of military action in the Korean peninsula, a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies has helped lift the industry.United Technologies Corp (UTX  -  Free Report) recently struck a $30 billion agreement to buy Rockwell Collins Inc (COL  -  Free Report), and earlier this week, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) announced its plan to buy Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion (also read: Northrop Grumman to Buy Orbital ATK in Major $7.8 Billion Defense Deal).Now let’s take a look at some defense stocks and their fundamentals to see if investors might want to consider them during these tumultuous geopolitical times. 1.       Engility Holdings, Inc.

316,HII,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a $24-million contract by the U.S. Army. Per the terms of the order, the company will work on the modification of Hydra rockets. Work related to the contract will be carried out at the company’s Williston, VA facility and is expected to be completed by Nov 30, 2017.Hydra-70 RocketsOrdnance and Tactical Systems, a unit of General Dynamics, is the primary contractor for the Hydra rockets. Hydra-70 rockets are 2.75-inch unguided rockets that include unitary and cargo warheads. They can be used for point and area targets. The missiles are part of a lethal yet lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability.In August, the company was awarded another $60-million contract for the modification of Hydra-70 rockets. General Dynamics has manufactured more than four million Hydra-70 rockets since 1996 for the U.S. Army.Regular Orders Boosting PortfolioGeneral Dynamics holds a strong position in the domestic as well as international defense space. In addition to being one of the two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the other one being Huntington Ingalls Inc (HII  -  Free Report), General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. This in turn allows this defense biggie to win notable contracts from both Pentagon and other U.S. allies.To this end, last month, the company secured a contract worth $311 million to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3 battle tank. We expect such awards to bolster the company’s revenue growth in the coming days.Defense Scenario Helping Industry GiantsThe growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times. The recent budgetary amendments in the country have also favored defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the days to follow.Moreover, the U.S. House passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion in July 2017.

(BA  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract, worth $600 million, to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Details of the ContractThis modification will supplement work that is already taking place under the PAR contract, which includes risk reduction activities and the acquisition of two commercial Boeing 747-8 aircraft.Per the contract, Boeing will complete preliminary design work for the modification of two 747-8 aircraft to replace the two aging VC-25A and Boeing 747-200, used as presidential support aircraft.The resulting modification to the aircraft, which is expected to be negotiated in a future contract modification, will include incorporating a mission communications system, electrical power upgrades, a medical facility, an executive interior, a self-defense system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities.Work is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2018 and will be executed in Seattle, WA. The contract will use fiscal 2017 research and development funds to complete the task. Future PlansFurther modifications are expected to be made in the contract, going forward. This will be done to include the purchase of the commercial 747-8 aircraft, in addition to designing, modifying and testing them to meet the standards for the presidential mission.Once the results of the risk reduction activities have been identified, the Air Force will offer the majority of the program on a separate contract.The PAR ProgramOn Jan 28, 2015, Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, Deborah Lee James, in coordination with Frank Kendall, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, revealed that Boeing’s 747-8 has been selected as the next presidential aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One.

318,HII,"Defense behemoth, General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 6.90%. It is worth noting that General Dynamics has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 5.20%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.41%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.44, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, General Dynamics’ combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and +0.41% ESP makes us reasonably certain of an earnings beat.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than Expected Earnings?General Dynamics derives its profits from a broad portfolio of products and services along with a wide customer base. Moreover, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the company boasts a strong growth momentum in the U.S. as well as overseas.In the second quarter, General Dynamics secured a handful of big contracts from the Pentagon. These include the $250 million deal to modify, test, train and sustain the Prophet Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic warfare (EW) system, and the $105 million deal for the execution of USS Makin Island (LHD 8) fiscal 2017 dry-docking phased maintenance availability. The company also won a $203 million modification contract to increase the design support requirements for Columbia-class submarines in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Coming to expectations regarding the second-quarter results, General Dynamics witnessed improved activity levels in Europe and China at the onset of the quarter. In particular, an uptick was observed in the demand for large-cabin aircraft in these markets. This would surely benefit the company’s growth trajectory and can be expected to get reflected in its upcoming results.Earlier, in the first quarter, the company almost completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on its two large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mideast and the U.K. As per management’s projections, these programs must have entered full production by now and thereby will likely boost the company’s international expansion in the second quarter and beyond.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.43 per share, down 0.27% year over year, while the revenue estimate is pegged at $7.80 billion, implying a 1.82% year-over-year improvement.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

319,HII,"Leading commercial aircraft manufacturer, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.24% in the preceding quarter. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 23.69%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayBoeing’s second-quarter deliveries showed an 8% year over year decline in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments were in line with the year-ago figure. Additionally, the company cited lower demand for its 737, 777, 787 and 767 jets that led to year-over-year decline in commercial deliveries of 183 airplanes, during the quarter. However, the numbers reflected 8.3% growth, sequentially.Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet declined to 123 from 127 a year ago. This reduction was due to Boeing’s greater involvement in the production of a newer version of its most popular plane, the 737 MAX. Also, shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners were 21 and 33 compared with 28 and 38 in the year-ago period, respectively. Boeing delivered three 767 jets compared with four in the year-ago quarter. However, shipments of 747 were three compared with two in the year-ago period.In the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled to 45 in the second quarter, in line with the year-ago figure. Nonetheless, the reported figure was up from 42 in the preceding quarter.In spite of these circumstances, Boeing still enjoys a steady flow of contracts for both its commercial and defense products. Evidently, during the quarter, Lion Group has committed to buy 50 737 Max 10 jets from the company for $6.24 billion. Also, Boeing signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet for 40 737 MAX airplanes worth $4.7 billion. Another MOU worth $2.5 billion was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes. Apart from this, it clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, valued at $8.1 billion.Notably, within the defense business, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $1.1 billion in the second quarter to procure Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) development. In fact, with this modification the total cumulative face value of the contract reaches $5.8 billion from $4.7 billion.The company also won a handful of other notable contracts like the $488.1 million modification foreign military sales (FMS) deal to remanufacture 38 AH-64 Apache aircraft and procure three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares, the $475 million contract to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) services in order to support the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems (MEUAS) program, and the $410.9 million modification FMS deal for providing 38 Apache aircraft three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares. We expect all these contracts to contribute significantly to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.For the second quarter, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a year-over-year increase of 626.1%, the same for revenues is pegged at $22.97 billion resulting into a 7.2% decline.Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Boeing Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boeing Company (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Boeing this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Boeing has an Earnings ESP of -0.43% as the Most Accurate estimate is $2.31, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged a little higher at $2.32. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Boeing’s carries Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Embraer SA (ERJ  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3.

320,HII,"Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Newport News, has clinched a contract to support the refueling and complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73). Work for this deal will be over by August 2021.Details of the ContractValued at $2.8 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.Per the deal, Huntington Ingalls will carry out the work in Newport News, VA. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to complete operations.A Brief Note on USS George WashingtonUSS George Washington is the sixth ship in the Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and the fourth U.S. Navy ship to be named after George Washington, the country’s first president. Notably, the Nimitz-class aircraft carriers are the largest nuclear-powered warships that can accommodate up to 6000 personnel on board.The latest models of this family of fleet, including CVN 73, are 317m in length and can reach a maximum speed of more than 30kt. These ships are equipped with Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) AN/SLQ-32(V) electronic warfare system that detects hostile radar emissions, providing a warning signal and interfaces to the ship's countermeasures systems.Why Huntington Ingalls?The company is the unique building yard contractor for all ships of the CVN-68 class, the reactor planning yard, the lead design refueling yard and the only private shipyard capable of refueling and overhauling nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.Consequently, it is the only company with the knowledge, experience and facilities that are essential for supporting the refueling and overhaul of CVN-73 without disturbing the Navy-wide overhaul and repair schedule.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of Huntington ships. Notably, the company’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines.Going ahead, we expect the company’s overall growth momentum to continue, given the recent positive budget revision done by the Trump administration. Notably, the shipbuilding business outlook remains strong, particularly in light of the fiscal 2017 spending bill. The bill includes Ohio-Class replacement, advanced procurement for refueling CVN-74, advanced procurement for CVN-80, two Virginia class submarines, two DDG-51s, advanced procurement for LHA-8 and TAO(X), continuation of CVN-79 and investment in a new Coast Guard Icebreaker. We believe the recently won contract by Huntington Ingalls to be a part of this encouraging bill and can expect more to such come in days ahead, which in turn will boost the company’s growth trajectory.Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied 29% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 38.2%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line. Also, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. As a result, the company's performance lagged the likes of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) that outperformed the industry.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

321,HII,"The U.S. aerospace and defense stocks have seen significant upward trends so far this year, primarily on the back of increasing geopolitical uncertainties worldwide. While a number of industry bellwethers posted encouraging results, the Aerospace sector also reaped the benefits. This impressive performance is anticipated to continue for the remaining half of the year as well, driven by the same factors which stoked the sector’s robust growth year to date.Sector Behemoths Impress in Q2Many sector behemoths have gained significantly year to date and posted improved earnings during the second quarter. In the Aerospace and Defense space, 90% of the stocks topped earnings and 70% exceeded revenue expectations, in the quarter. Undoubtedly, such bullish releases make us optimistic about the sector’s improved performance as we move into the reporting cycle for second half of the year. Below we have mentioned second-quarter earnings releases from a handful of the defense biggies:Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenues with both surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2% and 1.8%, respectively.Additionally, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) reported upbeat second-quarter 2017 results with revenues and earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Earnings and revenues of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate during the second quarter by 13.8% and 0.9%, respectively.Factors Favoring the Defense SectorCurrently, geo-political tensions, international terrorist acts threatening the security of nations and intra-national conflicts are on the rise. This in turn is leading to many civil wars, thus creating a lucrative growth opportunity for defense contractors.Again, factors like a growing international market for weaponries with many developing nations expanding their defense spending, the advent of innovative technologies in warfare and their increasing application as well as increased demand for cost-efficient production are driving revenue growth in the U.S. Aerospace & Defense space.In particular, a notable increase in the U.S. defense budget under President Trump has bolstered investors’ optimism on this industry’s ascension. In this regard, the U.S. House passed the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion on Jul 14 that extensively surpassed Trump’s earlier budget request.In addition to catering to a large domestic market, the U.S. defense majors are expanding their foreign markets rapidly, taking advantage of regional tensions prevailing in the Middle East. Rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India are also boosting these stocks’ prospect.Toward this end, it is to be noted that foreign military sales play a vital role in the growth story of U.S. defense stocks. The arms deal worth $110 billion signed by Trump with Saudi Arabia this May is reflective of this. Notably, this deal has the potential to touch $350 billion over 10 years.Other elements driving this sector include Trump’s defense strategy apart from the budgetary amendments. To this end, Trump's speech involving enhanced military spending in Afghanistan moved the defense stocks to a higher trajectory. Furthermore, the ongoing altercation between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on the terms of frequent missile testing from the both the nations, sent the major defense stocks rallying.Zacks Industry RankWe have 265 industries in our Zacks Coverage Universe, which we put into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).

322,HII,"Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Ingalls Shipbuilding, has clinched a modification contract to continue providing integrated planning yard support for CG 47 and DD 963 class ships. Work for this deal will be over by September 2018.Details of the ContractValued at $73 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. The modification includes options that would bring the cumulative value of this deal to $150.8 million, if exercised.Per the modification, Ingalls Shipbuilding will offer planning yard support like Navy modernization program planning, ship change planning development and installation as well as operating cycle integration program management. It will also provide type commander support, mobile assist teams, rotatable equipment pools, ship configuration and logistics support, provisioned items orders and other material support, along with surface ship life cycle management support.Apart from these, the company will deliver hull mechanical and electrical engineering standardization efforts, apart from providing diminished manufacturing sources as well as material shortages identification, tracking, and resolution support.Per the deal, Huntington Ingalls will carry out the work in Pascagoula, MS. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy), and operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete operations.A Brief Note on CG-47 & DD 963USS Ticonderoga (CG 47) is an Aegis guided missile cruiser, jointly developed by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report). Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Tomahawk missiles were deployed in these warships. Currently, they are equipped with Aegis Combat System, which integrates the cruiser’s electronic sensors and weapons systems to engage anti-ship missile threats.Notably, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system, used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Meanwhile, built by Huntington Ingalls, DD 963 Spruance-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. It was designed to hunt down and destroy high speed submarines in all weather but can also engage ships, aircraft, and shore targets. These multi-purpose combatants are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with Marine amphibious operations worldwide.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of Huntington ships.Going forward, the company's overall growth momentum is expected to continue, given the recent positive budget revision done by the Trump administration.

Hence, we can expect to witness more such contracts for Huntington Ingalls, in the coming days, which in turn will boost the company’s growth trajectory.Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied 32.7% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 41.6%.

323,HII,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in designing, building, overhauling, and repairing of ships, has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years.

324,HII,"In a bid to boost operating synergy and focus, sensor systems maker FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has reduced its business segments to half. The internal shake-up is in line with the company’s streamlining efforts to boost operational excellence.Beginning with its first-quarter 2018 operating results, the company will report financial results in accordance with this new operating structure. Further, the company announced that Tom Surran, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will step down from his position effective Sep 30, 2017.  The company has realigned six of its segments namely, OEM & Emerging Markets, Surveillance, Instruments, Security, Detection and Maritime into three units. The new segments will be called Government & Defense, Industrial and Commercial.While the current Surveillance and Detection segment will be absorbed into the Government and Defense, Instruments, OEM and Emerging segments will go under the Industrial segment. In addition, current Maritime and Security segments will be a part of the newly formed Commercial segment.FLIR Systems believe that creating a logical structure will help it to leverage its vertical integration as well as to focus on core markets. Restructuring activities undertaken by the company since 2013 have helped the company reap synergies and drive profitable growth combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions.Quarter to date, FLIR Systems’ shares have returned 11.3%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 9.3%. During the reported quarter, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s solid execution and streamlined business has helped it drive improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, operating margin, net income and earnings per share.We believe that strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels indicate the company’s resiliency, which will help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth.

325,HII,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., has secured a contract to offer logistics support services for government-owned fixed wing fleet performing special electronic mission aircraft missions.Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $116.9 million, has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2027, and will be performed in Herndon, VA. The deal will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Army) funds.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. In addition, this Falls Church, VA-based company continues to witness strong demand for its unmanned air systems on a global scale.Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, the outlook for various stocks in this space has improved manifold in the past months on the back of enhanced spending promises that Trump had made in his latest America First budget.Specifically, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal reflected an annual increase of approximately $2.2 billion more than the year-ago budget. Again, the Trump administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations included an additional base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase more than the current base budget level, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense.Also, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill recently, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March.If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost business growth of all the defense giants including Northrop Grumman. A moderate flow of funds from the Pentagon further added to the optimism.Going forward, we expect the increased spending to be allocated to certain key areas that might unlock higher opportunities for Northrop Grumman.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has rallied 27.6% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 39.9%. The downturn was owing to higher operating expenses that continue to partially impact the company’s profit margin. Also, Northrop Grumman may be challenged by economic and political factors. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which is a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

326,HII,"Defense major Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract, under which it will upgrade four P-3B aircraft, to support the government of Greece. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by December 2023.Details of the DealValued at $260 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will offer structural mid-life upgrades, tailored-phased depot maintenance, a country-specific designed mission integration and management system as well as new avionics for the aircraft. Notably, the mid-life upgrade will extend the service life of each aircraft by 15,000 flight hours.Majority of the work for this contract will be executed in Marietta, GA and Schimatari, Greece. Foreign military sales (FMS) funds will be used to partly finance the deal.A Brief-Note on P-3BManufactured by Lockheed Martin, P-3B Orion is a four-engine airliner-sized turboprop-powered aircraft. It is used for anti-submarine and maritime surveillance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in major defense programs of the nation like F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter; C-130 Hercules; F-16 Fighting Falcon; F-22 Raptor; and C-5M Super Galaxy. Notably this segment is a primary growth driver for Lockheed Martin.Moreover, FMS has been a strong forte for its growth trajectory, with the company witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East regions. In line with this, in October, Lockheed Martin signed a deal worth $3.8 billion, with the Bahrain Defense force, under which the latter will buy 16 upgraded F-16 aircraft. Surely, the deal will boost Lockheed Martin’s sales at the Aeronautics business division. Notably, this segment recorded 14% sales growth in the third quarter. It goes without saying that such consistent inflow of contracts both domestic as well as overseas like the latest one for P-3B upgrades will provide further impetus to this division’s sales growth in the coming quarters. This in turn will allow the company to retain its position as the largest defense contractor of Pentagon.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 24.6% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 36.9% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, Lockheed Martin's performance lagged the likes of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) that have outperformed the industry.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

327,HII,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, this military shipbuilder posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.52%. While the company’s Ingalls segment is expected to drive strong growth in the third quarter, the Newport News segment is likely to be a spoilsport.Let’s discuss these factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Ingalls Unit – A Key CatalystHuntington Ingalls’ Ingalls segment manufactures amphibious assault and expeditionary ships for the U.S. Navy and is the only builder of National Security Cutters (NSCs) for the U.S. Coast Guard. Notably, this division launched LHA 7, the second America-class amphibious assault (AAA) ship in May which has been driving sales volumes for this segment, lately. Based on the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter result, we expect the soon-to-be reported quarter’s results to reflect similar solid sales volumes, as well.  In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Ingalls business segment is pegged at $595 million for the third quarter, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.4%.Newport News Segment May Dent Growth: Here’s WhyHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last couple of years. Going ahead, no near-term improvement can be expected anytime soon for this business unit.In line with this, our third-quarter consensus estimate for Newport News unit stands at $988 million, reflecting an annual decline of 16.3%. However, at the onset of the third quarter, this business unit signed a contract with United Steelworkers of America as the largest bargaining unit, which in turn may boost this division’s results.Other Factors to ConsiderIn addition to the aforementioned facets of Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, a steady inflow of orders from Pentagon is expected to provide an impetus to third-quarter sales. Among the notable deals that the company won in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, worth mentioning is the $105-million modification contract for upgrading nuclear submarines, another modification deal worth $149 million to procure additional long-lead-time material for USS Enterprise (CVN 80) and a $2.8-billion contract to support the refueling and complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73).Moreover, the company’s Technical Solutions business continues to gain traction from Camber Corp’s acquisition.As a whole, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects improvement of 22.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $1.78 billion, implying a 5.9% year-over-year increase.What Does the Zacks Model Unveils? Our proven model shows that Huntington Ingalls has chances of beating third-quarter earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. While the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), its Earnings ESP is +0.84%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.80, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A positive ESP along with a favorable Zacks Rank serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

328,HII,"Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR  -  Free Report), a designer and manufacturer of aerostructures for both commercial and defense aircraft, is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.We expect Fuselage Systems segment to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the third quarter. Moreover, the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that the company recently signed with The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is expected to have a notable impact on Spirit AeroSystems’ quarterly results.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Spirit AeroSystems’ quarterly results.Fuselage Systems Unit – A Key CatalystSegment-wise, Fuselage Systems business unit that represent more than 50% of the company’s total sales continue to be a major growth driver. The third quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit.  Notably, improved demand for Boeing’s 737 program lead to the higher production deliveries for the 737 fleet. The solid 737 demand in the world market is expected to drive the company’s sales in this segment.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales is $912 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.1%.Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. QuoteIs MOU With Boeing a Concern?In August, Spirit AerosSystems announced that it has signed a MOU with Boeing for resolving commercial issues through 2022 related to several Boeing programs, including the production of 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner. The MOU is likely to improve its relationship with Boeing by addressing several issues. This in turn is expected to help Spirit AeroSystem achieve its long-term cash flow goals.However, as a result of the MOU, the company recognized a reach-forward loss of $353 million on the 787 program. Nevertheless, even after recognizing this loss, Spirit AeroSystems’ management raised 2017 earnings outlook, hinting at a possible upside in the company’s earnings growth during the second half of the year.In line with this, our consensus estimate for Spirit AerosSystems’ third-quarter earnings stands at $1.26 per share, representing solid annual growth of 8.9%.Other Factors to ConsiderThe company recently made some notable progress in the global fabrication business. It announced the creation of a new 5-axis fabrication center of excellence and the expansion of its chemical processing capabilities at Wichita, KS, campus.In addition, the company announced the creation of a new three- and four-axis fabrication center of excellence in McAlester, Oklahoma, and the expansion of its manufacturing facilities in Malaysia.In addition, Spirit AeroSystems unveiled its next-generation spoiler work on the A320 platform through application of its R&D technology strategy to reduce cost in partnership with Airbus. All these initiatives are expected to improve the company’s quarterly numbers.Notably, our consensus estimate for Spirit AerosSystems’ third-quarter sales is pegged at $1.73 billion, representing annual growth of 1%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Spirit AeroSystems is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Spirit AeroSystems possess both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Spirit AeroSystems has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Spirit AeroSystems currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

329,HII,"Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Newport News Shipbuilding, has clinched a modification contract to procure additional long-lead-time material for USS Enterprise (CVN 80). The work will be completed by Jan 2024.The deal, which is valued at $148.7 million, has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to the contract will be carried out in Newport News, VA, and the company will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to complete it.A Brief Note on USS EnterpriseThe USS Enterprise (CVN 80), Gerald R. Ford class’ third aircraft carrier, bears the name of the Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65).Once this aircraft carrier enters service, it will replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), a Nimitz-class ship. Notably, the Enterprise is scheduled to be constructed and be operational by 2027.The air wing of this new USS Enterprise will be capable of supporting more than 75 aircraft of varied kinds including fixed-wing and rotary-wing systems. Moreover, an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will be incorporated in the ship, to replace the steam catapults of the older versions.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of this company’s ships. Notably, this military shipbuilder’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines.However, this division has been lagging in performance for the last couple of quarters. In the first quarter of 2017, the segment witnessed more than 2% sales decline due to lower sales volumes on submarines.Nevertheless, we expect the company’s overall growth momentum to continue in the days ahead, given the recent positive budget revision done by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the shipbuilding business outlook remains strong, particularly in light of the fiscal 2017 spending bill. The bill include Ohio-Class replacement, advanced procurement for refueling CVN-74, advanced procurement for CVN-80, two Virginia class submarines, two DDG-51s, advanced procurement for LHA-8 and TAO(X), continuation of CVN-79 and investment in a new Coast Guard Icebreaker.Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied 16.3% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 26.2%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line. Also, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. As a result, the company's performance lagged the likes of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) that outperformed the industry.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

331,HII,"Debt financing is nothing new in the world of investment and only a fortunate few can avoid it. Most corporates resort to debt financing to ensure smooth business operations. This is because companies do not have unlimited funds and they need to boost their financial resources from time to time to expand operations.In fact, given the easy availability and affordability of debt compared to equity, in the majority of matured economies, the debt market is bigger than the equity market in terms of market capitalization. America – the richest economy in the world – is the biggest borrower too.However, resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments.In this context, it is imperative to note that the debt scenario in the U.S. is quite disturbing at this moment. Huge spending on wars, big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation’s burden over the years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150% of the economy’s GDP in 2047 from 77% currently.Nevertheless, this should not dissuade investors from investing in stocks as debt has been a part of the U.S. economy since its foundation. What investors need to do is to follow a prudent investment strategy and choose stocks that are burdened with lesser amount of debt.Herein comes the significance of financial leverage ratio. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage, or the extent of debt a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed historically for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popular among them.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio implies a more financially stable business, thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity.As debt-ridden companies are more prone to bankruptcy in times of financial crisis, the very foundation of making safe investment is to avoid high-leverage stocks.With the market gearing up for second-quarter releases, investors tend to get attracted to stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth, overlooking the debt on their balance sheet. Therefore to avoid huge losses we would urge investors to go for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratio.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion, it is imperative for a sensible investor to choose stocks that have a low debt-to-equity ratio.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy): No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGMScore of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 17 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report): It manufactures and sells building products primarily for use in new home construction, repair and remodeling, and outdoor structures, as well as light industrial and commercial construction. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.4% in the trailing four quarters.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

333,HII,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, clinched a modification contract for providing electronic warfare equipment to support Virginia-class submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by April 2020.Details of the DealValued at $71.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. Majority of the work will be executed in Syracuse, NY and Fairfax, VA; while the rest will be performed in Germantown, MD; Van Nuys, CA and Buffalo, NY.The contract will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion, fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion, fiscal 2017 other procurement and fiscal 2016 other procurement funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class Submarines The Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs), designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions. These are being jointly constructed by military shipbuilders General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these ships will be operational until 2070.What’s Electronic Warfare?Electronic Warfare (EW) represents the ability to use the electromagnetic spectrum-signals such as radio, infrared or radar — to sense, protect, and communicate. Being one of the top-graded defense contractors in the world, Lockheed Martin manufacturers advanced EW technologies that have the ability to control the electromagnetic spectrum.  The company also develops disruptive technologies to combat adversary threats.For the U.S. Navy, Lockheed Martin offers a handful of next-generation EW systems like the Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (AOEW), Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) and MK234 Nulka Off board Countermeasure System. By incorporating these new age warfare systems, the Navy fleets can detect incoming threats and effectively respond to them.Our ViewThe U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. Currently, the Navy plans to procure two Virginia-class submarines in fiscal 2018, for a total investment worth $5.5 billion. The move will boost the ship’s manufacturers — General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls — along with Lockheed Martin, the EW of which will be installed in these ships. We believe the recent modification contract is a notable step toward the fulfillment of the plan.Moreover, the fiscal 2017 defense budget strongly emphasized on enhancing the nation’s EW capabilities along with other defensive abilities. In particular, the budget included an investment of $1.2 billion for upgrading the U.S. fleets by spending more on development including for that of EW.  This raises hope for increased demand for Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven EW systems, which in turn will boost its revenues.Lockheed Martin’s EW serves the U.S., Australian and Canadian Navy. Going ahead, the global EW market is expected to reach a value worth $25.36 billion by 2021 and with Lockheed Martin being a dominating player in the space, the stock is poised to grow.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up 26.5% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 39.5%.This could be of the present defense budget which is in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks Rank & Key PickLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report), which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leidos Holdings surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of past four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 18.01%.

334,HII,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage”, which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of “A” or “B” to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM score of “A” and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7% for 3–5 years. The stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), which operates a passenger airline, has a VGM score of “A” and an expected EPS growth rate of 10.2% for 3–5 years. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the designing, building, overhauling and repairing of ships, has a VGM score of “B” and an expected EPS growth rate 15% for 3–5 years. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Time Warner Inc. , which operates as a media and entertainment company, has a VGM score of “A” with an expected EPS growth rate of 9.5% for 3–5 years. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), a leisure travel and cruise company, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM score of “A”.

335,HII,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 19, before the market opens.In the prior quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Textron has missed expectations in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.82%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTextron is a multi-industry conglomerate that is well-known for its brands such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee. Apart from manufacturing aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools as well as offering associated services, the company operates as a commercial finance corporation in select markets.With respect to second-quarter highlights, Textron won a couple of sumptuous contracts from Pentagon, which we believe will get duly reflected in the company’s increased revenue growth for the yet-to-be reported quarter. While one of these contracts, worth $475 million was awarded by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems (MEUAS), the other one was a Navy deal worth $146.6 million for repairing parts of the UH-1Y and AH-IZ aircraft.Coming to expectations regarding the quarter’s outcome, the company is likely to witness strong sales growth at its Industrial business segment, courtesy of the Arctic Cat buyout in the first quarter of 2017. This segment’s growth will be further boosted with Textron having started delivering its highly efficient ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the first quarter, which comes with zero battery maintenance.Although the company’s Bell segment has been dragging down its top line for quite a few quarters so far, management expects to see some upward potential, at least in terms of this segment’s margins, starting from the second quarter.  On the flip side, lower-than-expected Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) production in the first quarter hampered the company’s growth. Textron has incurred a notable loss of $24 million under a contract related to TAPV. In the near future, no significant improvement in this situation can be expected. We believe this program will remain a challenge for the second-quarter results as well. Also, the pre-tax special charges of $22 million incurred in the first quarter owing to the Arctic Cat acquisition, has forced the company to increase the annual pre-tax charges forecast by almost $15 million. These charges may also impose greater expenses on the company’s upcoming results.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents, down 16.86% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $3.59 billion, implying a 2.29% year-over-year increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Textron is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Textron has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Textron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Textron Inc.

336,HII,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 8.70%. It is worth noting that Lockheed Martin has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 13.88%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLockheed Martin continues to enjoy its position as the largest defense contractor in the U.S., courtesy of its varied product offerings. The multiple contracts won by the company from Pentagon as well as foreign allies raise optimism.The important contracts received during the second quarter started with the $582 million modification contract that Lockheed Martin won from the U.S. Navy, for providing air vehicle initial spares.In the same month, the company clinched a few other notable contracts, including a $288 million Army deal for acquiring Instrumentable Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) Combat Vehicle Tactical Engagement Simulation System (CV TESS) and a $373 million modification contract involving low-rate initial production of Lot 10 F-35 jets. Further, United Launch Alliance (ULA) – a Lockheed Martin and Boeing joint venture (JV) – won two modification contracts, totaling $416.9 million, for launch vehicle production services (LVPS).In the next two months of the quarter, Lockheed Martin won significant deals from Pentagon. These include a modification contract worth $208 million for LVPS and a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $471.7 million for Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS),Meanwhile, on May 20, Trump signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia, which holds a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years. Lockheed seemed to have garnered the majority of this huge arms deal. Saudi Arabia is set to procure its integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft, and rotary wing technologies and programs, for $28 billion.Moreover, at the end of the quarter, Lockheed Martin inked a landmark deal with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) – the defense arm of India’s multinational conglomerate, Tata Group – to jointly manufacture the former’s F-16 Block 70 fighter jets in India. This came as a move to expand its foothold in the Indian market, the world’s largest military weapons importer.However, management expects the company’s segment operating profit to remain under pressure for the second quarter and the rest of 2017, due to some unanticipated events that occurred in the first quarter. In fact, these events led the company to reduce its prior 2017 guidance for segment operating profit by $30 million.Moreover, the company’s Missile and Fire Control segment is expected to reflect a slightly lower-than-expected performance in terms of margin for throughout 2017. No improvement can be expected any time soon.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $3.09 per share, down 6.79% year over year, while the revenue estimate is pegged at $12.47 billion, implying a 3.47% year-over-year decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

337,HII,"Defense giant, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Being one of the largest U.S. defense contractors, it enjoys a strong presence in the U.S. Air Force, Space and Cyber Security programs.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 25.17%. It is worth noting that Northrop Grumman has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 10.87%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman’s better-than-expected first-quarter results demonstrated improved segment operating income, supported by strong sales growth and solid program performance. Similar outperformance can be expected in the soon-to-be-reported second quarter’s results as well.The company consistently follows a stable capital deployment strategy. In line with this, during the second quarter, Northrop Grumman hiked its quarterly dividend by 11%, bringing the annualized payout to $4 per share. This reflected the strong balance sheet and steady cash flow position that the company boasts. This, in turn, offers it substantial financial flexibility to invest in business and scope for incremental dividends.Further, the company won a handful of notable contracts in the second quarter. These include the $303.9 million modification deal for procurement of three low-rate initial production of second lot’s MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft, the $243.9 million contract for providing 72 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars and spares, and the foreign military sales (FMS) deal worth $179 million for providing hardware for large aircraft infrared counter measures (LAIRCM) and necessary support related to it. Such contracts will surely get reflected in terms of Northrop Grumman’s solid revenue growth in the second quarter and beyond.Moreover, the company identified a growing list of domestic and international opportunities across its businesses. This comprises the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program,MQ-25 unmanned aerial system, new Space programs and a variety of international opportunities for Autonomous Systems as well as upgrading Lockheed Martin’s F-16 jets with its SABR Radar. It also includes additional international opportunities pursued by its Technology Services segment in the Middle East and Australia.  Further updates on these opportunities can be expected once Northrop Grumman reports its second-quarter results.On the flip side, the company continues to witness lower sales volume for its KC-10 program, which dragged down its revenue from Technology Services in the first quarter. With no improvement anticipated soon in this issue, we expect the second-quarter results to reflect a similar sales decline for the segment.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.84 per share, up 9.32% year over year, while the revenue estimate of $6.21 billion implies a 3.57% year-over-year improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

338,HII,"On Jul 20, shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) have soared to a new 52-week high of $211.25, before closing the trading session at $210.28. The closing price of this aerospace and defense prime, which has a market cap of around $126.9 billion, reflects a year-to-date gain of roughly 35.1%.Over the last 52 weeks, Boeing’s shares have ranged from a low of $126.31 to a high of $211.25. The average volume of shares traded in the last three months is approximately 2.9 million.What's Driving Boeing?In June, at the Paris Air Show, Boeing announced the launch of the 737 Max 10, a new model that will compete with the Airbus Group's (EADSY) extremely popular narrow-body passenger jet, the A321neo.Notably, the Max 10 is the fifth member of Boeing’s single-aisle aircraft series and the third of the Max family. It was designed to be larger than its previous model in order to increase passenger capacity compared with the A321neo’s capacity, which was outselling the 737 Max 9.So far the decision has paid off. Evidently, Boeing received huge number of contracts for the new model leaving Airbus far behind. At the Paris Air Show, the company won 50 737 Max 10 jets orders, valued at $6.24 billion, from Lion Group. It also signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.In addition to the aforementioned deals, Boeing grabbed notable contracts for other models at the Paris Air Show, including a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion, at current list prices.Furthermore, the aerospace behemoth signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet, for 40 737 MAX airplanes, valued at $4.7 billion. Another MOU was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes, valued at approximately $2.5 billion.Apart from this, the company clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is expected to witness significant traction going ahead, especially in the single-aisle market.Notably, the second-quarter order details revealed by Boeing of late, shows that it booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects an increase from the year-ago figure of 171, which also will contribute significantly to the company’s top line.In the defense arena, Trump’s proposal to boost the nation’s defense budget by 10% in 2018 from that of 2016 is likely to benefit defense biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Again, the Trump administration has put forward the fiscal 2017 budget appropriation to expand the nation’s defense fund, citing that years of declining funding levels in the Army's investment and modernization accounts has hampered readiness of the U.S. forces.

339,HII,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations, and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Nutrisystem, Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report), which provides weight management products and services, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 18.3% for 3–5 years.

340,HII,"Aerospace giant, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), has secured a modification contract to offer full-rate production of six Lot 41 F/A-18E and eight F/A-18F aircraft. The terms of the deal includes delivery of these aircraft as well.Details of the DealValued at $676.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The deal will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds to complete the task, which is scheduled to be over by February 2017. While majority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, the rest will be executed in St. Louis, MS and various other locations across the United States.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. Also, it is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier.A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor —the F/A-18C/D — but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In particular, the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft compared with the other defense equipments. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, this aerospace giant has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Evidently, Boeing won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract last week, from the U.S. Air Force. The deal came up with a ceiling value of $499 million. Per the contract, the company will provide quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter.Earlier, in August, the company clinched a contract worth $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Meanwhile, the current budget scenario seems favorable for the defense industry, which buoys investors’ optimism this industry’s bellwethers like Boeing. In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. Markedly, the figure exceeded President Trump’s fiscal 2018 defense budget request proposed in March, 2017. If enacted, this budgetary amendment is expected to immensely boost Boeing’s as well as other defense majors’ business growth, going forward.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 91.9% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 41.4%. The improvement might have been because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Also, the company poses strong competition to its peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

341,HII,"While rising yields have somewhat dulled the appeal for dividend investing, stocks that consistently pay higher dividends are still in vogue.    Dividend Growth in FocusStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 25 stocks that fit the bill:Owens Corning Inc. (OC  -  Free Report): This Ohio-based company is a world leader in building materials systems and composite solutions. The stock delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.17% in the past four quarters.

342,HII,"Geopolitical tensions with North Korea and President Donald Trump’s push to expand the U.S. armed forces have recently given defense stocks a boost. Meanwhile, Senator McCain — U.S. Armed Services Committee Chairman — commented that the condition of the army is deplorable. Now, when ‘national security’ is high on the President’s agenda, it is least likely that such comments would go unheard.Against this backdrop, the rally in defense stocks may well last long. This is why it makes good sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolio.Defense Policy Bill Likely to be Signed into LawOn Jul 14, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill, which has an outlay of $696.5 billion that surpasses Trump’s earlier budget request. Democrats and some Republicans have opposed Trump’s plan to significantly increase defense spending on national security by introducing huge budget cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP.Despite such opposition, economists believe that the Defense Policy Bill will be likely signed into law. Moreover, matters concerning national security have always been high on lawmakers’ agenda, so much so that defense policy bills has been approved each year for more than half a century.McCain Expresses Concerns Over Defense ReadinessOn Sep 7, Senator John McCain had raised concerns about the “declining state” of the U.S. Armed Forces. He stated, “The state of our military is dire. The overwhelming majority of our forces are not fit for combat in the near term.”According to McCain, of the 59 army brigades, only three are “combat-ready”. Also, only four of the 64 Air Force squadrons would be ready almost instantly if a situation arises. Not even half of the total Marine and Navy planes are war-ready. Moreover, the Air Force immediately needs 1,500 pilots and surprisingly 1, 000 of those happen to be fighter pilots.Lingering Tussle With Kim Jong-un RegimeThe now familiar and nagging geopolitical tension between North Korea and the United States is also one of the major reasons why shares of defense contractors have surged in the recent past. Moreover, Trump’s ""fire and fury"" comment did bring about broad-based losses for the markets but defense stocks rallied.Recently, when Pyongyang tested its hydrogen bomb, it triggered a 6.3 magnitude earthquake. In response to the news of the hydrogen bomb test, U.S. Defense Secretary, James Mattis, gave a strict warning to North Korea. Mattis said that if North Korea engages in any act of violence against the United States or its allies, it would have to face a massive military response.On Aug 29, North Korea had fired a missile that passed over Hokkaido, Japan. Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, called the incident an exceptional, serious and severe threat to his own country. The U.S. President also responded by saying that he has “all options on table” when it comes to dealing with Pyongyang.Our ChoicesAs Trump pledges to expand the U.S. Armed Forces, defense stocks will shoot up. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is a defense giant. The aerospace company's segments include Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security (BDS), such as Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), Network & Space Systems (N&SS) and Global Services & Support (GS&S), and Boeing Capital (BCC).Boeing has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

343,HII,"Aerospace giant The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a modification contract for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (RSLFAC).  Details of the DealValued at $222.5 million, the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command Redstone Arsenal, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 30, 2021 and will be carried out in Ridley Township, PA. The contract will use fiscal 2017 foreign military sales funds.A Brief Note on CH-47 ChinookBoeing’s CH-47 Chinook is an American twin-engine, tandem rotor, heavy-lift helicopter. Its speed of 170 knots is faster than other existing utility and attack helicopters. Its main functions include troop movement, artillery emplacement and battlefield resupply. The U.S. Army has been using Boeing’s Chinook since 1962.Currently, the CH-47F/MH-47G modernization program is in full-rate production. This, in turn, will ensure that the American twin-engine remains in the U.S. Army at least through the 2030s. Particularly, Boeing is trying to keep pace with a slew of helicopter demand in domestic and international markets.Meanwhile, the demand for this helicopter is on the rise, internationally as well as domestically. Last month, Boeing received a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contract worth nearly $14.3 million to supply new parts of CH-47F Chinook helicopters to the Netherlands and Turkey.Earlier in May 2017, Boeing had won another FMS contract valued at $541.1 million from the Netherlands to build 15 CH-47F cargo helicopters. Notably, Chinook helicopters are utilized by the Netherlands government for both defense and humanitarian purposes.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Markedly, the FMS contracts supported the large US-based defense companies when there was a marginal drop in domestic orders.  Evidently, in November 2016, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced FMS of $33.6 billion for the fiscal year.Again, in May 2017, President Trump signed a $110 billion defense package with Saudi Arabia, which will span over seven decades. This deal surpassed the $38 billion US-Israel defense pact that was inked in September 2016 for 10 years. We believe the recently signed contract forms a part of this arms deal worth $110 billion.Thanks to the nation’s wide range of product offerings, because of which Boeing and other U.S. defense operators continue to receive defense contracts from the allied countries.To this end, in a recent development, the United States has agreed to sell its Patriot missile defense system to Poland, which will benefit manufacturer Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). The potential value of the deal could reach around $8 billion.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 78.6% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 37.1%. This might have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. In addition, the company poses strong competition to its peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

344,HII,"President Trump revealed a reversal of strategy in Afghanistan, promising to “fight to win” instead of withdrawing entirely. He vowed to ramp up U.S. engagement in Afghanistan, the country’s longest war to date. He added that moving troops away from Afghanistan would create a “vacuum”, which terrorists would “instantly fill”. But, he refrained from revealing specific troop numbers or measures of success.Defense stocks moved north on Trump’s Afghanistan speech, while such stocks have nearly doubled the S&P 500’s performance since his election victory. His commitment to swiftly increase military spending boded well for defense stocks. This calls for investing in such stocks for solid gains.Trump Announces More War in AfghanistanIn a much awaited speech, Trump announced that he won’t pull out troops from Afghanistan and is committed to a plan at winning the nation’s longest war, which is now in its 17th year. In other words, he is introducing a dramatic, new offensive in Afghanistan, which will integrate diplomatic, economic and military power. But, Trump refrained from divulging details on troop deployments or specific dates of operations for security reasons. He did acknowledge that his “original instinct was to pull out”, which was once an important campaign pledge before he became the President.Trump mentioned that the war will crush al Qaeda and prevent Taliban from taking over Afghanistan. He will urge NATO forces to join hands and support his new strategy. He also said that Pakistan is a terrorist hotbed and has harbored militants. Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network has found safe haven in Pakistan for the launch of multiple attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. He warned Islamabad of consequences if its government doesn’t take sweeping steps to eradicate such terrorist organizations. He stressed that Pakistan needs to have stronger ties with India in war against terrorists.Finally, he concluded that “terrorists take heed. America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat. Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense. In every generation we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed”.Big Money for Defense Contractors Tied to James MattisGeneral Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) stands to gain handsomely from Trump’s Afghanistan “surge’’. And why so? Prior to joining the Trump administration, Defense Secretary James Mattis was an “independent director” of the multinational defense contracting behemoth. He was paid $594,369 by the company between 2013 and 2016.It was during that time, the company boasted of receiving a $216 million order from the U.S. Army to build a “Warfighter Information Network” system. It was immensely successful in serving the army in Afghanistan. The company also received multi-million dollar payments for providing soldiers in Afghanistan items like Foxhound vehicles to IT management services.And now with Mattis holding a far more operational role, it can be expected that General Dynamics will benefit more from the Afghan war. Mattis now looks into more lucrative Pentagon contracts, which are positioned to even get more lucrative in the light of Trump’s declaration to deploy more troops in Afghanistan.Defense Stocks Rise on Trump’s SpeechDefense stocks rose broadly following Trump’s remarks, with the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) rising 1.2% on Aug 22. Major defense stocks like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) gained 1.9%, 0.9% and 1.7%, respectively. Northrop and Boeing were also awarded contracts for intercontinental ballistic missile system replacements.In fact, Trump’s pledge to significantly increase federal spending related to national security was cheered by Republicans and has helped defense and aerospace stocks scale higher. He had promised to seek a $54-billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems. The defense budget will climb 10%, according to the White House, while Trump recommended $30 billion in supplementary military spending for this year (read more: 5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Promises to Spend Big on Defense).5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy NowAs Trump’s Afghanistan strategy gives defense stocks a boost, investing in the same seems a prudent choice.

These weapon systems have been known to provide quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to the country’s strategic deterrent program.The Need of the HourWith rising threats from North Korea along with expansion of global terrorism, it has become extremely important for the U.S. to keep its defense weaponries updated.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants including Northrop Grumman.Notably, Northrop Grumman has developed into one of the largest domestic defense contractor in terms of revenue, with a major platform-centric focus. The company has a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs which have aided it in securing regular contracts from the different verticals of U.S. Defense. We believe the recently won deal is an example of that and will boost the company’s growth trajectory, going ahead.Price MovementShares of Northrop Grumman have returned 24.8% in the last one year compared to the industry’s increase of 34.6% in the same time period.This might have been led by the company’s escalating operating expenses, while steep competition from peers also remains a major concern.Zacks Rank and Other Stock to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Per the agreement, the company will provide additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines. (Read More: General Dynamics Wins $115M Virginia-class Submarine Deal)About Virginia-class submarinesVirginia-class submarines are nuclear powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) which serves the U.S. Navy. These submarines are the result of joint efforts by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Each of these submarines is valued around $2.7 billion and is expected to be operational until 2070.Why General Dynamics?General Dynamics is one of the two companies across the globe, equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. Therefore, the company enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.The U.S. Navy has plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years which will come with an additional mid-body section called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).The Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests of approximately $97.9 million for the research and development funding of the VPM. This indicates a possibility of additional defense contracts for General Dynamics.The Navy has also said that the Virginia-class submarines are one of its top priorities. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the one of the prime contractor for Virginia-class submarines.What’s in Store for Defense SpaceThe proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and others. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion.

347,HII,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage”, which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7% for 3–5 years.

348,HII,"Falls Church, VA-based Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., has won a contract to offer overall operations, and maintenance of command and control capabilities for the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $98 million, has been awarded by the 55th Contracting Squadron, Offutt Air Force Base, NE.Per the deal, Northrop Grumman will provide software engineering, system engineering, testing, incorporation, installation, security engineering and administrative support. Additionally, the company will offer added support tasks necessary to give dependable, effective, and user-friendly, net-centric abilities in order to contribute to the overall operations and maintenance of USSTRATCOM C2 capabilities for the commander of USSTRATCOM.Furthermore, these tasks will support combatant commands, component commands, and other authorized users with modernized mission critical communications and computer systems employing general integrated information and decision toolsets, applications and capabilities in a fully-synchronized, net-centric information environment, essential for maintaining deterrence and, if required, dominate in conflict.The work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2023, and performed in Offutt Air Force Base, NE. The contract will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds.Qualities of USSTRATCOMHeadquartered at Offutt Air Force Base, NE, USSTRATCOM is one of nine unified commands in the U.S. Department of Defense. Also, it is liable for strategic deterrence, global strike, and operating the defense department's Global Information Grid. USSTRATCOM offers a number of abilities to support other combatant commands that covers strategic warning; integrated missile defense; and global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR). Notably, this vibrant command gives national leadership a unified resource for better understanding of specific threats around the world and the means to respond to those threats swiftly.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. In addition, the company continues to witness strong demand for its unmanned air systems on a global scale.Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, the outlook for various stocks in this space has improved manifold in recent months on the back of enhanced spending promises that Trump had made in his latest “America First” budget.Specifically, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal reflected an annual increase of approximately $2.2 billion over the year-ago budget. Again, the Trump administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations included an additional base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion. A moderate flow of funds from the Pentagon also added to the optimism.Going forward, we expect the increased spending to be allocated to certain key areas that might unlock higher opportunities for Northrop Grumman.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has been up 19.9% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 27.6%. This could be because higher operating expenses continue to partially impact Northrop Grumman’s profit margin. Also, the company may be challenged by economic and political factors. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment, customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which is a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

349,HII,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Electric Boat Corp., secured a contract worth $7.7 million from the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Groton, CT.Per the contract Electric Boat will be responsible for detail designing, prototype manufacturing and testing of the Columbia main thrust bearing/vibration reducer system for the Columbia-class submarine program, formerly known as the Ohio Replacement program. The work will be carried out at the company’s Groton, CT, facility and is expected to be completed by Jun 2021.Columbia-Class SubmarinesThe U.S. Navy designed the Columbia-class submarine with the aim to replace its existing 14 Trident-armed Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines. Under the Navy’s Submarine Unified Build Strategy (SUBS), the Columbia-class submarines will be jointly constructed by General Dynamics’ Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) Newport New division. Per the U.S. Navy’s request, General Dynamics continues to be the prime contractor for designing and building the Columbia-class boats.Why General Dynamics?As one of the two contractors in the world with the capacity to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.The U.S. Navy has kept Columbia-class submarine program among top priority list. As a result, huge budget has been allotted to the program. General Dynamics being the prime navy contractor, is expected to win a major portion of contracts from the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Industry’s ScenarioDefense industry as a whole got a good boost when President Trump proposed a 10% hike in the 2018 Defense budget. Since then the industry has witnessed regular orders being awarded by different verticals of the U.S. defense.Earlier this month, Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Newport News, has clinched a $9.7 million modification contract to support the advance planning of the refueling complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73). Work for this deal will be over by Aug 2017. (Read more: Huntington Ingalls Wins Navy Deal for USS George Washington)Other defense giants such as Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) have also been on the receiving end of huge contracts from the U.S. military.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 42.7% in the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 27.6%.This could be because General Dynamics consistently maintains a strategic alliance with the U.S. Department of Defense, which allows it to enjoy a steady flow of contracts.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

350,HII,"Aerospace behemoth The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) won a modification contract for upgrading F-15 Radar Modernization program (RMP).Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2020.Valued at $94.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. Per the terms of the agreement, the modification includes exercise of options for 13 RMP Group A kits, 13 RMP Group B kits, 38 RMP installs, 14 conformal fuel tank installs, and other required support being produced under the original contract. Work will be executed in St. Louis, MO.A Brief Note on F-15 & RMPBoeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is undefeated in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories.Under the F-15 RMP, the legacy APG-70 mechanically-scanned radar incorporated in F-15 jets is replaced with an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) system - the APG-82(V)1 radar. Notably, APG-82 V1, manufactured by defense prime Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), optimizes the F-15’s multirole mission capability. It includes extended-range, superior multi-target tracking and precision engagement potential. This version also enhances the  system’s reliability over the prior model of APG-70 radar.Other hardware and software modifications comprising the RMP effort include a more powerful Environmental Control System, updates to the aircraft Operational Flight Program and Electronic Warfare software, a new radio frequency tunable filter and aircraft modifications.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, with its defense business standing out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog. The company has been receiving several contracts from the Pentagon to install the APG-82 radar systems on its F-15E fighter-bombers. With the installation of these radar systems, high-resolution ground-mapping data has been enabled in the F-15, which helps the crew to identify targets from great distances and increases situational awareness, lethality and survivability.Till date, Boeing has manufactured more than 1,600 of the aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire the F-15, thereby indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability. In 2016, the company delivered 15 F-15s, up 25% from the year-ago tally. Considering the recent contract for RMP and the escalating geopolitical tension across the globe, we may expect increased demand for Boeing’s combat proven aircraft in days ahead. This in turn, will boost the company’s revenue growth trajectory.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has moved up 85.7% in the last one year, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 39.8%.This might have been led by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. The company also poses strong competition to its peers like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

351,HII,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a contract to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft. It has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA.Contract DetailsValued at $323.5 million, the deal includes a five-year base contract with one five-year option period.Work is scheduled to be completed by Dec 30, 2023 and will be carried out at Missouri. The contract will use Navy working capital funds of fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2023.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet – a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet – is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier.Among the F/A-18 family, F/A 18E is a single-seat variant of the Super Hornet that is about 25% larger than its predecessor, the F/A-18C/D but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In particular, among other defense equipments the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. It also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late.Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Recently, the company clinched a modification contract, valued at $222.5 million, for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command. Again, it won a $349.2 million contract for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. Per the agreement, Boeing will deliver an affordable total system replacement of Minuteman III missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Meanwhile, Trump’s proposal to boost the nation’s defense budget by 10% in 2018 from that of 2016 is likely to benefit defense biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 78.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.4%.

352,HII,"Defense behemoth, General Dynamics Corp.'s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract to offer additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by October 2017.Details of the DealValued at $115.3 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. While majority of the work will be carried out in Groton, CN, the rest will be performed in Newport and Quonset Point, RI.Notably, the deal will use fiscal 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) and fiscal 2016 and 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funding to complete the work.Per the modification, Electric Boat will provide lead-yard services for the nuclear submarines. This, in turn, will sustain, update and support the Virginia-class design and associated drawings as well as data for each submarine, along with technology insertion throughout its construction and post-shakedown availability period.The company will also provide all engineering and related lead-yard services required for direct maintenance and support of Virginia-class ship specifications. Moreover, this contract offers development studies and design efforts in connection with the Virginia-class submarine design and design improvements, preliminary and detail component and system design, integration of system engineering, design engineering, test engineering, logistics engineering and production engineering.Meanwhile, Electric Boat will continue development studies and design efforts associated with components and systems to complete research and development tasks and prototypes, and engineering development models essential to fully assess new technologies to be inserted in succeeding Virginia-class submarines.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprises 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.Going forward, the Navy plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years. This will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  We believe the launch tubes of VPM will have the capability to carry a total of 28 additional Tomahawk cruise missiles.In fact, the Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM. This indicates additional defense contracts for General Dynamics, which, in turn, is expected to boost the corporation’s growth trajectory.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor. As a result, we believe that the modification contract will undoubtedly put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics's have rallied about 31.1% in the last one year, underperforming the industry's gain of 35.1%. This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cut in the U.S will likely hurt the company’s growth prospects. Moreover, the stock's performance also lagged compared to its peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), which also outperformed the industry.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

353,HII,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a modification contract to support sustainment of C-17 aircraft due to increase in fleet and number operating bases.Details of the DealValued at $7.1 billion, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, C-17 Contracting Branch, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2021 and will be carried out across the globe.A Brief Note on C-17Boeing’s C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft. The multi-service C-17 can carry large equipment, supplies troops directly to small airfields in harsh terrain anywhere in the world.In addition, it can take off from a 7,600-ft. airfield, carry a payload of 160,000 pounds, fly 2,400 nautical miles, re-fuel in flight and land in 3,000 feet or less on a small unpaved or paved airfield in day or night. Also, it can perform tactical airlift, medical evacuation and airdrop missions.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.For example, it recently clinched a contract worth $409 million, for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program. This deal forms part of a joint effort of multiple government agencies and industry to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies. Moreover, through it applied research will be conducted for enhancing knowledge and understanding of future power, thermal and controls requirements.Again, in June, Boeing secured a modification to a foreign military sales contract worth $410.9 million from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the original contract, it will provide 38 Apache aircraft, three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares to the U.K. government. Going forward, we expect such contracts, including the recent one, to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense big shots like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp.

354,HII,"Last week, TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) reported its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it continued with its impressive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter. Buoyed by positive industry trends and solid operational execution, the company expects to continue its earnings momentum on the back of complementary acquisitions and steadily growing end markets.We believe, an outstanding performance in the aerospace segment, commercial aftermarket and defense business bode well for the growth for rest of the fiscal year.  Also, the company, which enjoys a robust foothold in an expanding aerospace market which has several growth drivers working in its favor. Read on to find out the key drivers for this company right now.Factors at Play TransDigm’s long-term growth strategy rests on five pillars namely, expanding its proprietary aerospace businesses; executing value-based operating strategy; decentralized organization structure; strategic acquisitions and a diligent capital allocation strategy.An excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies, has helped the company to generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth and drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters.   TransDigm’s frequent acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, has helped it secure its place in the core market and grab greater market share. The company’s acquisition integration process focuses on increasing prices, diminishing costs, and winning new business.  During the third quarter, the company announced the acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million. These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with their proprietary products that enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation.However, on the flip side, the company is currently affected by a growing debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Also, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, TransDigm expects its debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017.The company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end market, which has thwarted its growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weaknesses in jet and helicopter markets have impacted the company’s top-line performance in recent times.Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the same space include Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Heico Corporation (HEI  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

Through this contract, applied research will also be conducted for enhancing knowledge and understanding of future power, thermal and controls requirements.Work will be carried out at Hazelwood, MI, using fiscal 2017 research and development funds.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late.
