19,FCX,"Copper stocks took a dive on Wednesday, dragged down with the price of copper on news of President Trump's plan to broaden the China trade war.XCopper prices fell to a nearly one-year low after the Trump administration produced a list of the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including consumer appliances and other finished and unfinished goods containing the metal.Southern Copper (SCCO) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) both slumped about 4%. Diversified mining giant BHP Billiton (BHP) lost 4%.Unquestionably the latest Trump tariff threats, along with the simmering trade battles already underway, have helped drag down prices of copper and other commodities. But the bigger story may be that last year's synchronized global growth surge is beginning to come off its peak, with slowing in China, Europe and emerging markets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePrices of copper, which is known as Dr. Copper for the metal's link to the economic cycle, fell 3% on Wednesday to $2.75 a pound and are now down nearly 20% from June highs.The pace of global growth has peaked and ""a deceleration phase now lies ahead,"" Nomura economists wrote this week. They forecast global growth of 4.0% in 2018 will slow to 3.7% in 2019, with risks to the downside.Global trade tensions certainly share the blame, but Nomura cites a range of negative factors, including ""a growth slowdown in China,"" European political uncertainty, higher oil prices, Fed interest-rate hikes and broader emerging-market fragility.The rising dollar, which is at least partly a byproduct of Fed rate hikes, has also put downward pressure on commodity prices and growth in emerging markets with dollar-denominated debts.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump Tariffs: This Is When You'll Know If China Trade War Is SeriousChip Equipment Stocks Get Price-Target Cuts On Market SlowdownThe Big Picture: Stocks Now Test These Critical LevelsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

23,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) topped third-quarter expectations early Wednesday thanks to higher copper prices, but the Arizona-based mining giant's outlook is clouded by Indonesia's moves to exert control over its massive Grasberg mine.Estimates: EPS up 138% to 31 cents on 5.1% revenue growth to $4.08 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Freeport earned 34 cents a share on revenue of $4.31 billion.Outlook: Freeport anticipates Q4 sales of 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 625 thousand ounces of gold and 23 million pounds of molybdenum. It said it was encouraged by progress in negotiations over Grasberg.Stock: Shares rose as high as 15.58 shortly after the open on the stock market today, nearing a 15.85 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. But the stock retreated to trade down 3.45% at 14.70.Freeport's shares have been held back by uncertainty over its Grasberg mine. Based on relative stock performance, Freeport ranks No. 14 in IBD's Mining-Metal Ores industry group, while Southern Copper (SCCO) shares closed at their highest level since early 2011 on Tuesday. Copper prices have climbed to a three-year high this month, buoyed by broad global economic strength, helped along by added demand for electric vehicles.The upturn in commodity prices is starting to revive mining activity, which was among the tailwinds that helped construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) blow past earnings estimates on Tuesday. Caterpillar dipped 0.3% early Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Caterpillar shares cleared a buy point of 99.46 when the company beat Q1 earnings estimates. A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for near-term gains, and Caterpillar has been a case in point, gaining close to 40% over the past six months. Here is a good place to start to look for other quality stocks that may be nearing buy points and poised for gains.In August, Freeport said that Indonesia will take a majority stake in its Grasberg mine after the imposition of export restrictions forced the company to halt production earlier this year. Indonesia said that Freeport could immediately apply for a 10-year permit extension through 2031, but terms of the sale weren't revealed at the time.The earning seasons for miners continues on Thursday, when Vale (VALE), the Brazilian iron ore miner, reports before the opening bell.Vale shares slipped 0.5% to 10.33.

25,FCX,"Mining stocks such as Australian giant BHP Billiton (BHP) are surging Friday on the release of strong Chinese import data, even as the longer-term picture of demand remains mixed. U.S. Steel (X) and other U.S.-traded steel charged higher as well on the Chinese numbers, but also on the growing scandal regarding Kobe Steel's data cheating.XChina in September imported more than 100 million tons of iron ore, a roughly 16% gain month over month, the new data showed.The data's release comes as China approaches a steel-production drawdown for the winter season, and makes moves to curb its production capacity and push its steel mills, coal mines and iron ore mines into profitable territory.""I think people were maybe under the assumption that iron procurement would start to fall, and that's really not what we're seeing,"" Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli said. ""But it's unclear what's the driver — if you're having demand being pulled forward in front of these production cuts.""BHP Billiton jumped 2.8% in the stock market today as Brazilian miner Vale (VALE) rose 6%, both retaking their 50-day moving averages. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) advanced 1.65%. Rio Tinto (RIO) popped 4% to a two-year high.U.S. Steel, meanwhile, shot up 7% to 27.36, moving back toward its 200-day moving average. Europe-based steel giant ArcelorMittal (MT) popped 8.4% to 29.36, a two-year high, breaking out of a 27.71 cup-with-handle buy point.  Nucor (NUE) rose 1.55% and AK Steel (AKS) 5.65%.Kobe Steel said its data cheating may have gone beyond Japan to some 500 customers. Boeing (BA) used falsely certified Kobe Steel on some planes, according to Reuters.""The Kobe Steel crisis is definitely helping other steel producers,"" Wunderlich Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said, according to a Reuters report.Rassouli said that if any major supplier were removed from the market, rivals would naturally benefit. But he cautioned that it was still too early to tell how Kobe Steel might be affected.Meanwhile, the Trump administration reportedly wants to add steel to the Nafta tracing list and require more of a vehicle be produced in America, moves that could burden the auto industry but potentially help U.S. steel makers.The SPDR Metals & Mining (XME) exchange traded fund climbed 1.3%.China's attempts to cut down on pollution have also led to more demand for higher-quality iron ore, potentially benefiting Vale, Rio and BHP.""An increased focus on pollution control in China has led to stronger demand for high-grade, low-impurity iron ore fines, lump and pellets and weaker demand for low-grade, high-impurity ores,"" Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina wrote in a research note dated Thursday.He added: ""We believe this flight to quality in iron ore is structural, and producers of high-grade fines (especially Vale), lump (Rio, BHP and Anglo) and pellets (Vale) will benefit from higher price premiums on average in the future than they have realized in the past.""Clarkson Plateau Securities analyst Jeremy Sussman, who covers mining stocks like BHP and Vale, said that he sees solid demand for bulk commodities for the next 12 to 18 months or so, with some bumps every now and then.""There'll be some fits and starts,"" he said. ""You'll see commodity demand decline a bit during the winter season.""LaFemina said he was still bullish on the space over the next six-plus months, citing supply constraints and upbeat global demand.Lee McMillan, a Clarkson analyst who covers U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal, said that much of the stronger sentiment toward China is driven by supply. He also cited some steel production curbs that came more quickly than expected in Tangshan, one of China's steelmaking hubs, a looming trade-case deadline against Vietnam, and China's attempts to clamp down on illegal capacity.Rassouli said he hadn't seen a huge shift in macroeconomic demand that would indicate any kind of surge. Gauging commodity demand, based on the new import data, can also be difficult.""It's hard to say exactly what it is, just because it's just this big headline number, and it's unclear exactly what's going on underneath,"" Rassouli said.RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Used Faulty Kobe Steel; FAA Inspecting Airbus EnginesSteel Maker Cites 'Slow' Trump Help For Earnings WarningFreeport Bends To Indonesia Will To Keep Mining Copper, GoldStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

30,FCX,"As Tesla (TSLA), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) accelerate electric vehicle production, Brazilian mining giant Vale (VALE) will invest roughly $1.54 billion to launch underground nickel mining operations in Canada to meet booming demand for minerals used in EV batteries.XVale's Voisey's Bay nickel move came as that project was nearing the end of its open-pit life, Bloomberg said. The bet on underground mining will extend the life of the mine by 15 years and create 1,700 direct jobs. Construction is likely to start this summer, with operations kicking off in April 2021.The move was also seen as a signal that Vale is bullish on nickel again. According to Reuters, Vale OK'd the underground mine in 2015, but slowed down plans last year on weak nickel prices and a major review of the company's assets.The Voisey's Bay complex mostly churns out nickel but also has cobalt, another critical EV battery metal that has seen its price jump recently.On Friday, sources told Bloomberg that Vale reached a $700 million deal to sell cobalt output from Voisey's Bay. Vale declined to comment.Cobalt, a metal that is typically produced as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining, extends battery life.Shares of Vale dipped 0.4% at 13.70 in today's stock market action. Rio Tinto (RIO), another miner poised to benefit from soaring demand for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, fell 0.1%. Lithium producer Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) lost 0.2%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which has partners with other miner to operate a cobalt refinery in Finland, advanced 0.9%.Tesla jumped 4.55% Monday, reclaiming its 200-day moving average as it continues a recent rebound.

Fiat Chrysler gained 0.7% and Ford fell 0.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAccording to automotive industry forecasts, EVs will take a 40%-50% share of the global auto market by 2040, up from around 3% today, with China leading that momentum.As a result, carmakers including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have laid out staggering targets for EV production, sales and investments.Improving Model 3 production also bodes well for battery materials demand from Tesla, a top EV manufacturer. Tesla also plans to mass produce batteries at its gigafactory and has been trying to secure supplies of key ingredients like lithium.But China has emerged as a dominant force in the scramble for EV battery metals, reaching deals to secure supplies.In May, a Chinese lithium producer bought a 24% stake in Chile's SQM.

Which will win?PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta (SPHB) climbed past a 38.93 flat-base buy point early Wednesday, after trading between 35 and 39 for much of the past 10 months. After an 18% run from a November bounce off the 50-day moving average, the fund cleared a flat base in mid-February and edged higher before forming the current pattern.The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P 500 High Beta Index, has gathered $152.9 million in assets. It invests in the 100 highest beta (or most volatile relative to the S&P 500) stocks in the S&P 500, which can lead to bigger swings in the fund's returns vs. the broader market.Industrials accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25, at nearly 24% of assets. Financials, at 23%, was next; information technology and energy weighed in with a respective 18% and 11%. Top holdings included construction gear provider United Rentals (URI), metal ores miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).SPHB has lagged the S&P 500 this year through Sept. 26, according to Morningstar Direct, with a 7.2% year-to-date return vs. 13.2% for the benchmark index. Its average annual return of 15% over the past five years, however, leads the S&P 500's 14% gain. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Advanced Micro Devices is a big chip designer, but how do its fundamentals and technicals rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.SPHB has a Relative Strength Rating of 62, higher than the 51 RS of its counterpart that was launched the same day: PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV). The $7 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, provides exposure to large-cap stocks with — you guessed it — low volatility. Shares are near a 45.79 flat-base buy point initially cleared Sept. 11.SPLV was featured in this ETF column July 13 as it found support at its 50-day line. It climbed 3% from the support line to a Sept. 12 intraday high. Before that, shares rose 5% from a May bounce off the 50-day.SPLV takes the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks and weights them so those with the lowest volatility get the biggest weighting. Financials made up the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25 at 21%; industrials were at 18%, utilities at 17% and consumer staples at 12.5%. Information technology represented 11%. Top names included Republic Services (RSG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).The fund has returned 12% YTD and averaged a 12.9% annual return over the past five years. It also bears a 0.25% expense ratio.SPHB is likely to outperform if the market takes off on the wings of high-beta growth stocks. SPLV is likely to do better if the stock market heads lower and low-volatility stocks fall less than high-octane growth stocks.Tuesday's picks, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), gave up some ground along with gold prices. Both held above their respective 50-day lines.RELATED:Apple Leads Dow; FANG Gains Fade; Did Gold Flash A Buy Signal?Apple, Techs Weigh On Stocks; Bitcoin Jumps; Time To Buy Gold?What An ETF For Extreme Stock Market Bulls Is Saying About Investors

49,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) said on Tuesday that Indonesia will take a majority stake in its massive Grasberg mine after export restrictions had forced the company to halt production earlier this year.Indonesia said that Freeport could immediately apply for a 10-year permit extension through 2031, but terms of the sale still remain uncertain.As part of the deal, Freeport, based in Phoenix, Ariz., has agreed to invest between $17 billion-$20 billion in the mine over 14 years. Freeport already sold a 10.6% stake in the mine to Indonesia last year for $630 million, which was a far cry from its ask of $1.7 billion, Reuters reported.The agreement comes as copper prices have hit a three-year high of $3.08 a pound. That's helped vault Freeport and some other big mining stocks into buy zones, the point at which investors have the best shot at near-term gains.Last week, Freeport cleared a 15.37 entry, and Brazilian miner Vale (VALE) topped a 10.49 buy point. Both stocks were in cup-with-handle bases.On the stock market today, Freeport shares fell 2% to 15.22, undercutting its buy point after dropping as low as 14.64 intraday. Vale rose 0.3% to 10.85 after falling to 10.62 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

In 2016, the big cap earned 24 cents a share vs. a loss of 13 cents a share in the previous year. This year analysts expect a 271% increase to 89 cents a share.Supply problems are pushing up metal prices.

The current pattern is a lopsided double-bottom base with a 24.17 buy point. The stock cleared the entry Tuesday morning but then fell back under the buy point. Volume was quiet.Also adding to the bullish mood was speculation that corporate and individual tax cuts are increasingly likely. CNBC reported that stock analysts say that Republicans are determined to succeed on something, and the tax cuts are achievable, though not necessarily to the aggressive degree that President Trump has called for in the past.In economic news, Redbook's weekly measure of same-store sales at department stores, discounters and chain stores rose 3.2% vs. the previous week's 2.5%.

78,FCX,"The world's biggest copper producer is set to maintain its fee for physical delivery of the metal to the U.S., ending at least four years of declining premiums, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper giant, will agree to charge about 2.5 cents a pound on top of the price traded in New York for metal delivered to southern U.S. ports in 2018, the people said, asking not to be identified because talks are private. The Santiago-based company declined to comment on negotiations.The physical delivery price charged by Codelco traditionally serves as a benchmark or reference in negotiations between other buyers and sellers in the U.S., who will gather in Dallas next week for the annual American Copper Council meeting to negotiate premiums.While rolling over the premium from last year may curb the enthusiasm of copper bulls expecting a sharp tightening of the market, it would mark the first time in at least four years that the premium hasn't fallen.The previous negotiation process resulted in a half-cent drop after demand weakened. Now metal prices have recovered to near three-year highs as Chinese-led demand proves more resilient than expected and producers continue to focus on margins rather than growth after a sharp price downturn.Copper for delivery in December rose 0.3% to $3.0985 a pound at 2:11 p.m. in New York. In London, the metal for delivery in three months rose to $6,855 a metric ton.""We are benefiting from the positive copper market that has resulted in higher prices than many expected,"" Richard Adkerson, chief executive officer of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), the second largest producer of the metal, said in the company's earnings call last month.

86,FCX,"As Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen takes the stage in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday, financial markets are betting that weak inflation will persist and policymakers will hike just once in the next 12 months. Yet, surging industrial commodity prices — a leading indicator of inflation pressure — are starting to cast doubt on that consensus.XIn recent days, aluminum has hit its highest level since 2013, copper futures touched $3.00 a pound for the first time since 2014, and zinc is near a decade high. The iron ore roller coaster is back on the ascent, with prices rallying nearly 50% after bottoming in June.The commodity price upswing reflects the most broad-based global growth since the Great Recession. On Wednesday, eurozone manufacturing surveys showed that the growth-challenged region is expanding at its fasted clip in a half-dozen years. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi also will address the monetary policy gathering and may offer a signal as to when the bank will begin to taper its bond-buying program.The Fed, by all indications, will announce a shift in its reinvestment policy on Sept. 20 to gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Yet as markets continue to discount a slower pace of tightening — current pricing doesn't point to another interest-rate hike until March 2018 — the rise in commodity prices suggest investors may be underestimating the power of a synchronized global upturn to push inflation higher.The rise in commodity prices, which also is being helped by China's moves to curtail production amid environmental concerns, has sparked the mining sector, with Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) making a run at a 15.46 buy point this week and BHP Billiton (BHP) just below a 41.89 saucer-base buy point. Last week, Southern Copper (SCCO) hit a buy zone. Brazilian miner Vale (VALE) rose 3.3% on Wednesday and is just below a 10.50 buy point of a cup-with-handle base going back to late February.IBD'S TAKE: On Tuesday, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.One reason inflation pressures eased after peaking in February was a pullback in commodity prices. The Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index has shown the annual rate of inflation easing sliding from 2.2% in February to 1.4% in June, and core inflation easing to 1.4% from 1.9%.The reversal to the upside for industrial commodities, which hasn't yet included a rise in oil prices, may take some months to feed through to end prices. While subdued inflation pressure also reflects competitive pressures in a wide of array of industries, the inflation outlook now looks a bit less tame.RELATED:These Mining Stocks Are Near Buy Zones As Metal Prices RiseThis Miner Hits Buy Point, 4 Peers Are Close As Metal Prices Soar

92,FCX,"The federal government is on track to run a cumulative budget deficit of $9.4 trillion over the coming decade, including $1.4 trillion in 2027, or 5.0% of GDP, new Congressional Budget Office projections indicate.Over the decade, public debt is projected to rise from 77% of GDP to 89%. The updated outlook underscores the challenge President Trump will face as he relies primarily on a narrow GOP majority in the Senate to slash taxes for businesses and individuals and undertake a major infrastructure push.That agenda has fueled the postelection stock market rally, lifting shares of materials companies like Nucor (NUE), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) that would benefit from an infrastructure push. The prospect that companies will see their after-tax earnings boosted by tax cuts has been a boon to companies that do most of their business in the U.S., such as AT&T (T) and Jack in the Box (JACK).IBD'S TAKE: The ability of Republicans to dramatically cut the corporate tax rate may rest on a House GOP plan to impose a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years. But the plan, which could hurt Wal-Mart and Apple, faces a bruising political fight.In the campaign, Trump promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, savings that the GOP hoped to derive by repealing ObamaCare now look somewhat doubtful. Three GOP senators have lined up behind a repeal-and-replacement of ObamaCare that looks to be just as expensive.Trump is already signaling plans to go after nondefense discretionary programs, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency, but Republican leaders are warning him that there are limited savings to be found outside of entitlement programs. Discretionary spending already has been curbed under a budget sequestration deal between the GOP Congress and President Obama.Trump's own budget director pick, Mick Mulvaney, said at Tuesday's Senate confirmation hearing that the $20 trillion national debt must be ""addressed sooner rather than later.""RELATED:Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans

95,FCX,"At the end of 2015, the outlook for commodity prices wasn't rosy. Weak oil prices, a rising dollar and forecasts for uncertain economic recovery in China kept estimates for the year to low single digits.Among ETFs, that put the IShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers Fund (PICK) near the bottom of a brutal four-year decline. But the forecasts for commodity prices were wrong.As a result, MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers on Friday traded 52% higher for the year, and 95% above its January low.A host of factors — led by promises of reduced steel production in China — changed early in the year. Prices for iron ore, coal and other commodities ramped sharply higher. A four-week spike and sell-off in commodities and in mining stocks during April and early May raised fears of a bubble. But following a brief consolidation, prices simply stepped back into an uptrend.MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers' top holdings were positioned to take advantage of the cyclical turn. The funds very top positions are in diversified ore miners. Australia's BHP Billiton (BHP) holds a 9.3% weighting in the fund. U.K.-based Rio Tinto (RIO), and Glencore on the London Stock Exchange, weigh in at around 7% apiece.IBD'S TAKE: BHP Billiton ranks 11th in the Mining-Metal Ores group, based on key stock gauges, including earnings, sales and stock price performance. To see which stocks rank in the top four of the group, including a BHP Billiton sister company, check out IBD Stock Checkup.U.S. steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal have weightings near 3%. Other names in the top 10 holdings include Arizona-based miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and South Korean steel maker Posco (PKX).For chart readers, MSCI Global has this year presented an exercise in frustration. The ETF peaked in April, then pulled back and consolidated below that high through the end of September.A two-week pullback from a Dec. 8 high has left the fund finding support at its 10-week moving average. If it holds that support and either rebounds or builds a base pattern, it could create a buy opportunity.A cut below that support — particularly a drop in heavy trade — would flash a sell signal to current shareholders.Going into 2017, a number of the factors that held commodities views down at the end of 2015 are still in place. The dollar is rising even more sharply, and China is now saying it is content if growth slips below the 6.5% mark that it originally targeted over the next four years.Rising oil prices and improving U.S. GDP growth offset those negatives to some degree. But BHP Billiton, in a statement in mid-October, said its oil and gas markets appeared set to improve over the next 12 to 18 months. Iron ore and metallurgical coal prices were ""stronger than expected,"" the statement said, but the company expected supply to continue to outgrow demand ""in the near term.""Barclays has forecast a broad-based recovery in commodities prices during 2017, based on improving demand. Consensus views place earnings growth for BHP at 47% in 2017, with estimates of 50% growth for Rio Tinto. Freeport-McMoRan is poised for a 407% earnings leap, as it continues making its way back from a loss of 13 cents per share in 2015.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

96,FCX,"Gold prices slid 2.9% on Thursday to a 10-month low while silver prices crashed 7% as markets continued to react to the Federal Reserve's more hawkish policy outlook for 2017 amid President-elect Donald Trump's plan to step on the fiscal accelerator.While hiking its key interest rate a quarter-point on Wednesday, as expected, Fed policymakers signaled a likelihood of three more rate hikes in coming year vs. the two 2017 hikes telegraphed in September.Fed intentions helped lift the U.S. dollar index to the highest level since January 2003, a negative for gold, which is priced in dollars and whose safe-haven demand as a store of value is being tarnished by a stronger dollar and improving growth. The Spdr Gold Trust ETF (GLD) fell 1%, setting a 10-month low.Shares of gold miners including Barrick Gold (ABX), Royal Gold (RGLD) and Newmont Mining (NEM) have been among the biggest laggards in the Trump rally. The IBD Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems group is rated 194 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.On the stock market today, Barrick lost 5%, hitting a multimonth low intraday after sliding 6.4% on Wednesday. Royal Gold gave up 6%, on the heels of Wednesday's 4.0% decline. Newmont shares sank 2.4% on Thursday after skidding 6.5% a day earlier.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Freeport McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper mining companies and among the best ways to play the copper rally, cleared a buy point at 13.69 on Nov. 10 and quickly became extended, surging 21% in two weeks. The stock has pulled back, but is worth keeping on your watch list. Visit IBD Leaderboard to keep track of leading stocks like Freeport and others nearing a buy point.Silver Wheaton (SLW), which owns rights to gold and silver production at various mines, tumbled 8.8% after Wednesday's 3% skid.""Investors might conclude that even with higher rates looming for 2017, U.S. equities will remain the asset class of choice for most,"" wrote INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.Investors looking for a safe store of value in this climate may have reason to turn to other metals — those with more industrial applications. IBD's Mining-Metal Ores group has been among the biggest winners of the Trump rally, helped in part by his agenda for an infrastructure-spending binge.Since Nov. 8, gold prices have fallen close to 12%, while copper is up about 9%, though copper prices had been firming before the election on a more favorable supple-demand balance.Freeport McMoRan (FCX), a leading stock in the group, is also a gold miner, but it derived 67% of revenue in 2015 from sale of copper and 10% from gold, with oil and molybdenum accounting for most of the balance. Shares of Freeport rose as high as 14.97 but reversed lower to trade down 4 cents at 14.61.Mining giants Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) fell 2% and 1.4%, respectively.RELATED:Fed Sees 3 More Hikes In 2017; 'Fiscal Boost Not Needed,' Yellen SaysWhy Some Strategists Still Like Gold Despite Its Recent WeaknessProfit Recession Is Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014

100,FCX,"Swing trades can be a good way to stay in phase with sector rotation. Taking profits quickly can help avoid corrections in stocks going out of favor. At the same time, capital is freed up to take advantage of other stocks showing renewed strength.Stock reversals are of particular interest when sector rotation is underway. As a reminder, we aren't trying to catch stocks at their bottoms or at their weakest. We wait for a sign of strength that the trend has changed and the weakness is potentially over.What does a reversal look like? By definition, you need some type of trend in place to reverse from. In the case of a buy signal, when a downtrend is in place, you will see a final test of the lows. When the stock surges, closing high in the range, it shows an attempt to change the trend. Sufficient strength can be the start of a new move at least in the short term, especially when accompanied with volume.The downtrend itself can occur in a couple ways. A short-term downtrend shows a pullback that is part of a larger overall uptrend. If a long-term downtrend is in place, there is usually a shift within the industry that drives the flood of buying and causes the reversal. In that case, you want to see a break of a long-term trend line or a bottoming base to become the foundation from which the stock launches itself.Take Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) from last year. The stock was down more than 90% at its lows in January 2016 — a huge drop but in line with its industry group. From those lows it went up more than 200% by March, getting back above its 40-week moving average line and breaking its 18-month downtrend. That might seem too far and too quick to be on anyone's radar. But that was the level of strength needed to overcome the severity of its decline.After the big gain, it saw a short-term pullback and was added to IBD's SwingTrader on April 26 after reporting earnings (1). It quickly scored its first profit target of 5% the next day, and half profits were taken (2). A profit goal of 10% was reached later that same day and the decision was made to see if it could be held for bigger gains. While it saw bigger gains the following day, the reversal from the highs (3) — the flip side of what we've been talking about — was enough to add caution. The stock was removed for an average gain of 8.3%. Not bad for a couple days and part of an even larger move among the mining sector.As with any trade, things might not work out the way we would like. Rather than a new move up, the reversal could just be temporary strength before a bigger move down. That's where a stop loss comes in. Setting it at the low of the reversal day protects us when we're wrong and lets us know unequivocally that the reversal has failed.Current ideas as well as past trades of IBD's SwingTrader are available to subscribers and trialists.

101,FCX,"A busy day of headlines Tuesday resulted in a nice day of outperformance for the Dow Jones industrial average and a new high for the S&P 500 but a sluggish day overall for tech stocks.Alphabet (GOOGL) cast a pall on the tech sector after the company reported earnings late Monday. Shares fell 3%.At the close, the Dow rose almost 0.5%; the S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%. Small caps fared the best with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq both coming in higher than Monday's levels.X Inside the Dow, Caterpillar (CAT) soared 6% on a nice earnings beat and second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. McDonald's (MCD), meanwhile, jumped 5% as Wall Street cheered solid earnings as well as a 3.9% increase in U.S. same-store sales, nicely above expectations.Financials also outperformed as bond yields rose. Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) ended with gains of nearly 2%. JPMorgan is back near highs but just below a 94.08 buy point. Goldman has been a laggard in the financial sector for a while now as it trades near  its recently converged 50- and 200-day moving averages.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up 7 basis points  to 2.32% as the two-day Fed meeting got underway. A decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.The market is not expecting a rate hike tomorrow, and one more before the end of the year is still in question, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Futures traders think there's a 47% chance the Fed will hike rates one more time before the end of the year.Some oil and gas-related groups outperformed as oil prices jumped. September WTI crude oil jumped $1.55, or 3.3%, to settle at $47.89 a barrel.Heavy-volume gainers included Rio Tinto (RIO). Shares jumped 5% to 45.93. It's still in buy range after gapping up over a 45.81 cup-with-handle buy point. Mining firms outperformed on the heels of strong results from Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which soared nearly 15%.On the downside, shares of Seagate (STX) crashed more than 16% on a big earnings miss. It's been a laggard since gapping below the 50-day moving in late April. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) was another big loser, down 10%, despite another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth.

102,FCX,"Stocks rolled into the first real week of the earnings season with mixed feelings, as names like Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) backed away from early highs but remained positive, with Netflix shares soaring in after-hours action on its Q2 results.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 all closed within 0.03% of their starting position. Small caps had a shade more momentum, lifting the Russell 2000 index 0.1%.A weak reading on a New York-region manufacturing gauge and signs of more possible regulatory intervention in China's markets may have rattled investors early in the session. But investors were also looking toward Netflix's Q2 report and the week's increasingly busy earnings schedule, and the market was due for a breather after last week's strong performance.Specialty steel makers were at the top of the sessions best-performing industries, led by Carpenter Technology's (CRS) 6% gain. Retail and mining groups posted many of the day's strongest moves. Macy's (M), Conn's (CONN) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) figured powerfully in those advances.Netflix bolted 8% higher after reporting strong subscriber growth and guidance despite weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings.Apple notched its seventh straight advance, retaking its 50-day moving average, although a retreat from early highs left the stock below the session's midway mark, only pennies above the 50-day line in a weak-volume move.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) each rose 2%, helping boost the Nasdaq 100.On the Dow, Apple couldn't outpull IBM (IBM) and JPMorgan (JPM), which each dropped more than 1%.Trucking fleet operator J.B. Hunt (JBHT) rolled up a 3% gain in heavy trade, despite reporting second-quarter earnings below analysts' targets. The stock is up 13% from a May low and back above support at both its 10- and 40-week moving averages.Among IBD 50 stocks, YY (YY) swept ahead 3% in better than double its average trade.  That put the stock 7% above a 61.62 but point in a flat base, after breaking out past the marker with a heavy-volume 9% spike Friday.Cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI) dropped 4% in fast trade after making a $7 billion bid to acquire Lightower Fiber Networks.

116,FCX,"Talk about hot! Imagine if quarterback Tom Brady were as good at playing defense as he is at leading the New England Patriots offense. That would be impressive, right? Well, that two-way talent is what fund manager Craig Hodges displayed in 2016.Hodges is a quarterback of the $15.9 million Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund (HDPCX), whose 71% gain through Dec. 29 outperformed all other U.S. diversified stock funds regardless of size. Contrarian is a small-cap value strategy. At the same time, he's also lead signal-caller for the $411.5 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), whose 40.47% gain made it 2016's third-best performing growth fund.Value. And growth. Two very different strategies. And outperformers both.Hodges Fund, the larger of the two portfolios, has been driven by leaders like Southwest Airlines (LUV), which climbed 16% in 2016 and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92; construction and industrial leasor United Rentals (URI), which jumped 46% for the year and also sports a 92 Comp Rating; and construction materials maker Eagle Materials (EXP), up 63% in 2016 and boasting a 90 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Hodges Fund co-manager Eric Marshall recently told IBD why he and Craig Hodges like stocks such as Horizon Pharma, Facebook and Texas Pacific Land Trust.Hodges is also CEO and chief investment officer of Hodges Capital Management and the son of Donald Hodges, founder of Hodges Capital's parent company. Craig Hodges, 53 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Dallas.IBD: What should investors do with their portfolios in 2017?Hodges: We're optimistic about some niches in retail, some selected companies. J.C. Penney (JCP) is one. Some low-hanging fruit. The old (company management) regime almost wrecked the company. The new regime is turning the company around, making it profitable.We don't like retail as a whole, but we like some selected names like Duluth Holdings (DLTH) and G-III Apparel (GIII), which have significant upside.And there are some names in consumer discretionary. Adidas (ADDYY) has taken market share from Under Armour (UAA) and Nike (NKE). There are some names we feel good about.IBD: Which existing holdings got a boost from the Trump election?Hodges: We owned a good position in U.S. Concrete (USCR) as well as Eagle Materials and U.S. Steel (X). Those could benefit if the new administration acts on its interest in investing in infrastructure.We already had quite a bit of exposure to energy, and we added to some like Diamondback Energy (FANG), RSP Permian (RSPP) and Matador Resources (MTDR). Those are our three favorite Permian Basin plays. Hillary Clinton was viewed as anti-fracking, so a lot of those stocks went up. Long term, we think those companies are as well situated as any we know in energy.Volaris Avia (VLRS), a Mexican airline, dropped from about 20 to about 14 or 15. It was on concerns that trade with Mexico would be affected. But we think that fear is political rhetoric. In fact, we think trade with Mexico will be a big part of what (the U.S. does).IBD: Have you bought any stocks that looked poised to benefit from the Trump election?Hodges: Yes, one is Forterra (FRTA). They're in the water infrastructure industry. They provide cast cement piping, precast products for a wide range of water-related infrastructure, even drainage. If you build a road or bridge, drainage is essential. And they have a good management team. They had an IPO right before the election. That was not a good time for an IPO, so we got it at a favorable time.About Nov. 11 (as its share price climbed) we started buying a larger stake. We bought quite a bit in the 17-18 range. It ran up above 20, pulled back, then we added to it. Now it's trading near a 52-week high (around 22).We bought some (Mexico-based) Cemex (CX) ADRs. Thirty percent of their business is in the U.S. They got hit hard by the election results. We think the stock has a good chance to go back to where it was before the election.IBD: Am I right in thinking that Contrarian and Hodges funds are about as different as funds can be?Hodges: Contrarian is just that. It buys the most out-of-favor, unloved name we can come across. About 80% of its stocks would never cross over into Hodges Fund.IBD: Freeport McMoRan (FCX) posted eight straight quarters of EPS slowdown before finally notching a gain. Why do you still like this mining company?Hodges: Our assessment is that they will survive. They're doing things necessary to survive. They're selling off Gulf oil properties, getting their balance sheet squared away, fixing their short-term ills. Our cost is under 6 per share. (It's trading around 13.50). They're not out of the woods, but their asset sales will get them out of the woods.IBD: Facebook (FB) said last month that its advertising-revenue growth rate would slow, which hurt its share price. Do you still like the stock?Hodges: We think it's the ultimate social media company. They're the ones that continue to gain market share. They're diversified. They own Instagram. They're the ones hurting Twitter (TWTR). They're rock solid in my mind.For us, it's a way to participate in what's going on in social media without paying a crazy multiple. It's not inexpensive, but relative to their number of users and how fast it's growing, it's inexpensive.The stock hasn't done much for a quarter and a half. Maybe people who bought it in the 130s are selling and taking losses. But the stock will do well next year.IBD: Southwest Airlines posted a 1% decline in earnings per share growth in the third quarter and it expects a revenue decline in Q4. Do you still like the airline?Hodges: The days of wild fluctuations in earnings for airlines are gone. The competitive landscape is more friendly. They've gone from eight main carriers to three, and Southwest is the fourth.There are barriers to entry. It's expensive to buy the fuel-efficient planes that you need to compete. Meanwhile, Southwest is paying down debt. You've seen a decrease in airlines' earnings estimates, but most are up 30% to 40% (in share prices) for the year. All are buying back their stock. I imagine Delta (DAL) (which Hodges Fund also owns) will continue to raise its dividend. Others might pay more, once they pay back debt. Southwest is buying back a lot.IBD: Match Group (MTCH) aims to help people get an education and get a spouse. It's somewhat new to Hodges Fund. What's your thesis?Hodges: They are like the Facebook of online dating. They own several different dating sites. Their biggest is Match.com, but they also own OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and BlackPeopleMeet. They have 45 dating brands. In the education space, they own PrincetonReview.com.They make money from advertising and membership fees. They don't have a great growth rate, but they own such a good(-size) part of the business that it creates a barrier to entry.IBD: United States Steel's earnings per share grew 61% and 157% the past two quarters after slowing for five quarters in a row. What's the driver?Hodges: The main thing is, people don't understand how hard it is to get into the business, even after there have been so many bankruptcies and so much consolidation. And China has been dumping steel into the U.S. for years. Now there's a president who not only will refine trade agreements but push to get a level playing field for companies like U.S. Steel.There just isn't a lot of (U.S.) competition, but U.S. Steel has tremendous earnings power. Shares trade in the mid-30s. Shares traded near 200 in 2008 on $17 per share in earnings. They're not going near that. But this company could earn $4 to $5 a share in two to three years. On that, the stock could trade back into the 60s or 70s. With a more robust economy, you could see some real multiple expansion.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewTop-Notch Investor's Bets On Likely Trump-Era Stock LeadersFranklin DynaTech's Matthew Moberg Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWarren Buffett Liked Airlines So Much That He Bought Several

Revenue soared to CAD$2.89 billion, more than double the CAD$1.26 billion a year ago.But both were below estimates in Canadian dollars.Outlook: Management offered vague guidance about future results that will be heavily affected by commodity pricing: ""We set a monthly sales record in steelmaking coal in March, as we saw an increase in demand following a slow start to the quarter. We are now through the difficult winter weather and are seeing improvements in service levels from our logistics providers putting us in a strong position for the remainder of the year.""Stock: Shares of the Canadian miner tumbled 3.1%, diving below its 50-day moving average but finding support at its 50-day. Few stocks performed better than Teck last year, as industrial commodity prices unexpectedly bounced off a long-term bottom, but shares have been range-bound since the U.S. election. The company derives most of its revenue from sale of steelmaking coal, zinc and copper.As for other big miners, BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) rose 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Vale rose 2.4%. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and and Vale (VALE) have been in a modest downtrend, above their 200-day lines but below their 50-day averages.RELATED:Freeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveZinc Situation Likely To Boost Teck Resources

128,FCX,"Freeport McMoRan (FCX) jumped Thursday on word that it's close to a deal to resume copper ore exports from its giant Indonesia mine. Alcoa (AA) popped on unconfirmed chatter about a possible takeover by Rio Tinto (RIO).Freeport McMoRan should soon get Indonesia's OK to export copper concentrate from its Grasberg mine for six months while the miner and country work on a long-term export license. Indonesia halted exports in January, wanting Freeport to do smelting in the country. But Freeport has put big investment plans for Indonesia on hold.Freeport shares rose 4.6% to 13.31 on the stock market today, rebounding from their 200-day line.More copper supply isn't good news for copper prices, but metals futures were generally higher Thursday afternoon. Among other big miners, BHP Billiton (BHP) rose 1 cent to 36.90. Vale (VALE) fell 0.8%. Rio Tinto climbed 0.5%. BHP, Vale and Rio are all trading above their 200-day lines but below their 50-day averages.BHP Billiton is dealing with a long strike at the its Chilean copper mine, the world's largest. Rio Tinto investors also are keeping an ear out for talk of a Rio takeover of Alcoa.Aluminum producer Alcoa, which split from value-add aluminum products firm Arconic (ARNC) late last year, rose 1.8% to 33.49 after setting a session high of 35.14. The stock is still below its 50-day line.RELATED:Steel Stocks Rise Amid Commerce Department's Dumping Findings

129,FCX,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

Deutsche gave Teck a buy rating, up from hold, lifting its price target to 25 from 24. Shares of Teck, up early, closed down 4.5%.Freeport had been sinking since a close of 17.02 on Jan. 24. The next morning, the company missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates and said that Indonesia was holding back on granting the company an export license renewal. For now, Freeport is restarting a portion of output to serve a domestic smelter.IBD'S TAKE: In January, Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson offered an outlook with copper supply deficits. While that could happen with an acceleration in global growth, one potential driver of those deficits, President Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure program, is stuck in the slow lane behind ObamaCare repeal.Bad news for Freeport since late January has helped support copper prices. About half of the capacity of its Cerro Verde mine in Peru has been sidelined by a labor strike. Meanwhile, Chile's Escondida mine majority-owned by BHP also has seen work stoppages.In a Monday note, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch said it sees ""limited scope for sustained copper price increases near term,"" noting China's reduced copper import needs due to its increase in refined copper production. Still, it's keeping a $3-per-pound mid-year price target.RELATED:Freeport-McMoRan Stock Dives On Weak Earnings, Indonesia WoesMining Giant BHP Billiton Earnings Spikes 687%; Dividend Hiked 150%Stocks Open Higher; Energy, Miners Rise Ahead Of Fed Vote

135,FCX,"Markets have had a week to digest the shift in direction due to the election and so far it has been for the better. Last week's column shared the strategy of waiting for some pullbacks and flattening patterns, and the markets have seemed to cooperate.The Nasdaq composite started participating in the move as it established itself above its 50-day moving average and reached new all-time new highs early on Friday. Proshares Ultra Nasdaq Biotech  (BIB), mentioned in last week's column, was subsequently added to IBD's SwingTrader watch list on Nov. 16 as it formed a five-day consolidation that is part of a handle to a larger pattern. The ETF continued to pull back to its 10-day moving average on Friday.The SwingTrader product also got to book a couple profits: a quick, powerful gain on AMD (AMD) when a deal with Alphabet (GOOGL) pushed shares up, and a slower, milder gain for Arista Networks (ANET). More names working acts as an important confirming data point on an improving market.Another stock currently being watched is Freeport McMoRan (FCX). This is not the first time the stock has been on the radar of SwingTrader. On April 19, it was put on and quickly gained 5%. The trade ended with a raised stop loss getting triggered and a 1% gain getting booked in two days. But the stock was not forgotten.After a quick 17% correction, the stock reversed after its earnings report and was put back on the current trades list a short while later on April 26. It saw a more impressive gain of 8% in two days with two profit-taking sells on the way up. This move was the subject of a previous Swing Trading column from July 11 on industry group moves as both the metal ore miners and gold/silver/gem miners held spots in the top 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups.Fast-forward to today, and another group move is unfolding. This time, the metal ore miners are flexing their strength as the No. 7 group, but the gold/silver/gem miners are languishing down at No. 184. The movement in metal ore miners is not surprising with Donald Trump's win. The president-elect's promises for infrastructure investment sent many building and material stocks soaring, and copper — the metal of choice for Freeport McMoRan — has been a beneficiary.Freeport McMoRan has just gotten back to its April highs, meaning this swing trade avoided sitting with dead money for half the year. The stock just joined the Leaders List on IBD's Leaderboard product as it broke out of its cup base. It currently looks to be forming a handle.  A breakout that surpasses the high of 14.26, with accompanying volume, could offer a new profit opportunity in the stock.More details on Past Trades and Current Trades of SwingTrader are available to subscribers and trialists.

143,FCX,"It's often said, usually in a footnote somewhere, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. But that doesn't mean the past is without value. Having numerous examples of stock behavior gives guidance and context to form expectations. Knowing what is normal behavior and when conditions are reaching extremes may suggest your best course of action, appropriate position sizing, and optimal strategy for approaching the market.November 2016 seemed to be a month of extremes giving the shorter-term swing trader some opportunities. It started early when major indexes suffered a nine-day losing streak (1) through Nov. 4. For the Nasdaq composite, you had to go back to 1984 to find that many consecutive losses. For the Russell 2000, it happened more recently but still a decade ago in 2006.A funny thing about extremes is that when you swing so far one way, you tend to swing back the other. The Russell 2000 demonstrated that in November as well. Its losing streak was immediately followed by a 15-day run of gains (3), a feat not accomplished by the index since 1996. IBD's SwingTrader product took some solid gains in names like FreeportMcMoRan (FCX), featured in this column two weeks ago. But rather than get overly aggressive after 15 days up, SwingTrader turned cautious since the market was due for a correction — which showed up with a vengeance Wednesday. Another instance of extremes was the divergence between the performance of the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes. After the election, the Russell shot up sharply while the Nasdaq struggled. Normally, in a strong rally, the indexes march together. One may be stronger, but the disparity is not so wide.Looking at the trailing 10-day performance of the indexes shows how stark the contrast was. On Nov. 14 (2), the Nasdaq was up 1.3% over the last 10 trading days while the Russell 2000 was up 10.2% in the same time period. That 9-percentage-point difference is something that was only seen before in the period between 1999 and 2001. In that case, it wasn't the strength of the Russell 2000 rather it was more a function of the extreme weakness in the Nasdaq tech bubble burst.The recent sector rotation was probably more of an influence in the difference between indexes rather than the small-cap bias of the Russell. Banks specifically were a shining point that favored the Russell 2000 over the Nasdaq. The difference between indexes was even greater with the Nasdaq 100, which excludes financial stocks.After a month of extremes, it's no surprise that some investors got a sinking feeling in their stomachs from the swings, but what does it mean for the future? For one thing, a swing trading style may be preferable if the market remains in a short-term mindset.Ideas for swing trading and market action analysis are available to subscribers and trialists of IBD's SwingTrader.

144,FCX,"The stock market's newfound enthusiasm about a Donald Trump presidency isn't the only reason that the Dow industrial average has hit a record high and the S&P 500 is in striking distance. With most of the third-quarter earnings season in the books, it's now clear that the earnings recession is finally over.Not only did profit growth turn positive in Q3 after four straight quarters of year-over-year declines, but fourth-quarter earnings are shaping up to be best in two years. The first quarter of 2017 looks better still, at least for the moment.Pockets of weakness remain. But key industries are back on track.Financials are one driver of the earnings rebound. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led the way in the third quarter as adjusted earnings per share surged 20% from a year ago, fueled by strong growth in trading, investment banking and lending.Bank stocks continue to soar as long-term Treasury yields have skyrocketed since the presidential election. A steeper yield curve should widen banks' net interest margins.The technology sector is on pace to post Q3 earnings growth of 11%, says Thomson Reuters. That would be the best since the fourth quarter of 2014, thanks partly to 91% earnings growth at Facebook (FB) and 23% at Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and less of a profit-decline headwind from falling profits at Apple (AAPL). The iPhone and iPad innovator saw profit slide 15% from a year ago, after a deeper 23% slide in the second quarter.The improved profit picture is coming just in time. The Federal Reserve is set to start hiking interest rates again next month, meaning that the days of investors seeing bad news for the economy as good news for stocks may be behind us for now.""I think the secular bull market in stocks is transitioning from an interest-rate-driven bull market to an earnings-driven bull market,"" wrote Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, in a Nov. 4 commentary.IBD'S TAKE: The materials sector is one of the early winners from Donald Trump's surprise election. Shares of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials have surged above buy points. Nucor is the early stages of a breakout above a 57.18 buy point. Visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock buys and keep an eye on IBD Leaderboard to find leading stocks primed for a breakout.Overall, with about 90% of S&P 500 companies reporting, the big-cap index is on track to post Q3 earnings growth of 4.1% and revenue growth of 2.6%. A combination of cost-cutting and share repurchases helps explain that gap.""Aggregate earnings continues to benefit from a reduced share count, and slightly more so than during Q2,"" noted Joe Abbott, chief quantitative strategist at Yardeni Research. ""Shares outstanding is down 1.2% year over year in Q3 compared to a 0.9% decline at the same point in Q2.""The biggest gap between profit and revenue growth came in the materials sector, with profit up 10.8% and revenue down 0.8%. Copper producer Freeport McMoRan (FCX) swung from a 17-cent per-share loss a year earlier to a profit of 14 cents per share on cost cutting and a recovery in commodities prices. Shares of Freeport McMoRan rose to a buy point on Thursday with a lift from Trump's plan to fund a massive infrastructure package.The health care sector was near the head of the pack for Q3 revenue growth as sales rose 7% and profits 7.5%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was among the sector standouts, with earnings per share up 23% and sales 12%, driven by growth at its Optum health services unit.Consensus analyst projections point to an acceleration in over S&P 500 profit growth this quarter to 6.4%, the best since 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Profit growth is currently seen leaping to 13.7% in the first quarter of next year.Keep in mind, though, that estimates for fourth-quarter earnings have been trending lower in recent weeks, Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD. The good news is that the ""magnitude and pace of declines (in earnings targets) is not as severe"" as it has been in recent quarters, he said.Facebook earnings growth is expected to slow from 91% to 65%, as revenue growth decelerates to 45% from 56%. The social media company said after it reported strong Q3 results that it expects ""to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.""Overall, tech earnings growth is expected to slow to 7.1% in Q4 from 10.7% in Q3, before re-accelerating at the start of 2017.Shares of Apple, Facebook and other tech giants have retreated recently amid a major sector rotation out of techs, defensive stocks and gunmakers into banks, drug and materials firms.The biggest shift in fourth-quarter earnings is expected to come in the energy sector, thanks to a relative stabilization in oil prices. Earnings are expected to rise 8.2% from a year ago after sinking 66.5% in Q3. Exxon Mobil earnings are expected to rise 12% to 75 cents a share from the fourth quarter of 2015 while remaining well south of the $1.56 a share earned in the final quarter of 2014.Some third-quarter reports are still on the way. Wal-Mart (WMT), which has been spending heavily to raise wages and compete with Amazon (AMZN), is expected to report a 7% fall in year-over-year profit and a 1% rise in revenue on Nov. 17.RELATED:Facebook Dives On Forecast For 'Meaningfully' Slower Ad Revenue GrowthUnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, Guidance Trump Victory, Agenda Likely To Spur Lasting Stock Market Rally

145,FCX,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

Zinc rose for a fourth straight session as copper, aluminum, nickel, lead and tin advanced in London, helped by the outlook for tighter supplies and a plunge in the dollar, which bolsters the appeal of metals as alternative investments.“It’s strength across the board,” Garrett Nelson, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said by telephone from Richmond, Virginia. “The dollar’s down a lot, and commodity prices are up, so the equities are up also.”Industrial metals slumped 27% last year as China’s economic slowdown heightened demand concerns, prompting mining companies, including Freeport, to shutter output. Shares of Phoenix-based Freeport, the biggest publicly traded copper producer, gained 11% at 4:03 p.m. ET. Vancouver-based First Quantum advanced 14% in Toronto.Newmont climbed 11% in New York, the biggest gain since November 2008. Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont, the biggest U.S. gold producer, was helped by bullion prices that jumped to a three-month high on Wednesday.Gold futures broke above the 200-day moving average for the first time since October, a level considered bullish by traders who follow chart patterns, Barry Allan, an analyst with Mackie Research Capital Corp. in Toronto, said by e-mail.Image provided by Shutterstock.

155,FCX,"U.S. stock indexes stepped up to nice gains Tuesday afternoon as citizens went to the polls to choose a new president and Congress.The Nasdaq rose 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was up 7% on the NYSE but down 10% on the Nasdaq. Election Day is often a day of routine volume. The day after a presidential election is more prone to active trade, though it too can be quiet.Blue chips were mostly up, with winners leading losers in the Dow by a 5-1 ratio. The biggest gainer was insurer Travelers Companies (TRV), which rose more than 2%.In the S&P 500, Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) led with a 7% pop. The copper, gold and silver miner is working on a base. The Street expects Freeport to earn 23 cents a share this year, up from 2015's loss of 13 cents a share. In 2017, analysts peg earnings at $1.14 a share, which would be a 396% increase. Both estimates have been raised by analysts.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) thrust up 10%. On Monday, MaxLinear beat the Street's consensus views on earnings and revenue.Second best in the IBD 50 on Tuesday morning was Priceline Group (PCLN). The online travel services firm gapped up 7% to a record high in strong volume. Priceline also beat the Street's numbers on the top and bottom lines.Stocks jumped up Monday after news that the FBI had once again cleared Democrat Hillary Clinton in an email probe. The reaction seemed to suggest that the big money favors Clinton.The stock market could get a surprise for Wednesday's session if Republican Donald Trump pulls off an upset. Most polls had Clinton winning, but two polls dissented. The Los Angeles Times/USC tracking poll said Trump led by 2 percentage points in the four-way race. The IBD/TIPP poll also pegged Trump's lead at 2 percentage points in the four-way contest. Percentages were rounded off. The IBD/TIPP poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.The polls, however, were not adjusted for the Electoral College's state by state results. So, it's possible a candidate could win the presidency without a popular majority.Trump has unsettled the Street with anti-free trade talk, but also has promised an aggressive cut in the corporate tax and a repeal of ObamaCare.The new makeup of Congress, though, could toss cold water on the plans of either Clinton or Trump for good or bad.RELATED:Trump Holds Lead In IBD/TIPP PollIs IBM About To Become A Buy?

156,FCX,"Gold prices tumbled Wednesday to their lowest levels since February as upbeat economic data sent the dollar to a new 13-year high. Barrick Gold (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG) and other precious metal stocks also tumbled.The dollar index climbed 0.6% as October durable goods orders increased 4.8%, the best gain in a year. The dollar has rising on expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December, with perhaps more hikes in 2017. Gold and the dollar move in opposite directions most of the time.The news sent gold down 1.8% to $1,189.30 per ounce, hitting its lowest levels in more than nine months.Barrick shares tumbled 4.7% to 14.63 on the stock market today, its worst close since early April. Newmont Mining plunged 5.1% to 31.50, also a multi-month closing low. Goldcorp dived 4.4% to 12.91, falling intraday to its worst point since Feb. 3. Silver Wheaton (SLW), which owns rights to production from various silver and gold mines, fell 4.2% to 18.32.The SPDR Gold ETF (GLD), a commodity ETF that tracks gold prices, fell 2% to 113.25, the lowest since early February.IBD'S TAKE: The SPDR Gold ETF is a downturn, but investors can find top ETFs with IBD's ETF Leaders Index. Not all that glitters is gold.Copper and industrial metals have been rising on stronger economic growth and President-elect Donald Trump's promise to spend $500 billion rebuilding U.S. infrastructure. Mining giant BHP Billiton (BHP) rose 1.1%, trading near a 1-year high. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) leapt 7.2%, hitting a 16-month best intraday.RELATED:Health Care ETFs Fall As Eli Lilly, Juno Add To Troubled Sector's WoesStock ETFs Rise Further With Five S&P 500 Sectors Hitting New Highs

158,FCX,"Bears swatted the U.S. stock indexes lower midday Thursday with the catalysts open to question.The Nasdaq lopped off 0.7%, gaining back some ground after being down as much as 1.3%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average matched that loss. The lone gainer was the Dow Jones utility average, up 1.3% in the stock market today.Volume rose on both exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday, keeping to a recent trend of increasing on downward price action, which is a bearish pattern.What was driving the indexes lower? Some analysts pointed to weak data from China. Others said the likelihood of an interest-rate hike from the Federal Reserve continues to make the market uneasy.China's September exports fell 10% from the year-ago level, far weaker than the 3% drop expected. U.S. Steel (X) gapped down 6%, while specialty steel firm Carpenter Technology (CRS) gapped down 3%. Apart from the China factor, steel prices have dropped, putting additional pressure on steel firms.Meanwhile, a rate hike is looking more certain. CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the chance of a rate hike by December at about 70%, up from 67% earlier in the week..IBD'S TAKE: Here is a savvy Way To Play Interest Rates, and it's not about investing in banks.Another factor that could be roiling the markets is the U.S. presidential election. A study by Sam Stovall of S&P Global Market Intelligence shows that the party that currently controls the White House wins if the S&P 500 rises from the end of July to the end of October. Right now, the gauge is down about 2.5%, which would suggest challenger Donald Trump will win. But this gauge has roughly two more weeks to run before it gives a conclusive reading. The accuracy of the gauge going back to 1944 is 86%.The years when the election indicator didn't work tended to be years when a strong third party was in the mix. This year the Libertarians and the Greens are threatening to pull amounts that could be pivotal on a state-by-state basis.Blue chips were mostly down. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was one of the few exceptions, up 1.4% in brisk volume. The blue chip retailer sank below its 200-day moving average on Oct. 7 in heavy volume, but the stock is just 9% below a 52-week high of 75.19.The stock has been sliding ever since a breakout in November 2014 ran out of gas. Watch for a new bottoming base to form.In the S&P 500, Freeport McMoRan (FCX) took the hardest hit, down 7% in twice its usual volume.Only eight stocks in the IBD 50 were up. The biggest loser was chip designer Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO), down 6% in heavy volume.RELATED:Which Sector Leading Stock Expects The Biggest EPS Gain?What To Watch For As Big Banks ReportMany Retailing Stocks Have Been Forming The Bottoming Base Pattern

159,FCX,"The Federal Reserve's signal on Wednesday that it will proceed at a snail's pace in raising rates lit a fire under commodities prices. Along with gains in oil prices, copper futures jumped 2.1% to a seven-week high. Platinum futures stretched their two-day gain to 3%, while gold futures were up 2% over two days to $1,344.70 an ounce.Higher commodities prices are naturally good for mining company profits, so investors bid up shares of the group both on Wednesday and on the stock market today.BHP Billiton (BHP), whose shares have been consolidating after a breakout attempt in mid-July, rose 0.9% on Thursday to 32.46, just off a 10-month high. Rio Tinto (RIO) tacked on a further 1.5% gain to 32.52, after rising 3.7% on Wednesday and is now approaching a buy point at 33.87. Both BHP and Rio are diversified mining giants that produce iron ore, copper and a range of other industrial commodities.Miners with less diversified revenue streams such as Southern Copper (SCCO) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) also saw gains -- 0.4% and 4.2%, respectively -- but are further from a buy range, likely reflecting the underperformance of copper relative to other metals this year.The Fed's go-slow policy is good news for demand for metals and other dollar-price commodities because it's expected to keep a lid on the dollar and promote global growth.The Fed's ""dovish"" intentions ""should reinvigorate investors' appetite for emerging-market risk,"" wrote HSBC economists Kevin Logan and Ryan Wang.Industrial metals may benefit more than gold because improving growth, should it materialize, could take the shine off of safe-haven assets.Still, Royal Gold (RGLD) shares jumped nearly 10% on Wednesday, rising to the top of its recent range after a seven-week consolidation that followed several breakouts earlier this year. But after opening higher on Thursday, shares closed down 1.3% at 84.09.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rose 0.2% to 127.57. One of the most popular gold ETFs, it climbed 1.5% on Wednesday, regaining its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: As important as the Fed's decision on raising interest rates is its guidance. This IBD story and video offers context for the Fed's sharply divided stance yesterday.The Fed is being cautious in raising rates because it doesn't want to end up where the Bank of Japan is, rolling out one new trick after another only to find that each of its actions fail to shake off deflationary pressures. But if the Fed, in erring on the side of being too accommodative, risks letting inflation percolate for too long, gold offers a hedge against inflation.Mining stocks have been among the better-performing industry groups this year as supplies are finally coming in line with demand — or in some cases undershooting demand — after miners overdid it in expanding out in 2010, when there appeared to be no stopping China's rip-roaring economy. But after right-sizing their operations and balance sheets for a slow-growth world, companies in the sector are in position to benefit as long as the Fed doesn't take away the punch bowl.Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina wrote in an Aug. 22 research note that BHP Billiton, which is benefiting from the surge in coking coal prices, and Rio Tinto were likely to boost capital returns to shareholders over the next two years.RELATED:As Gold Rallies After Fed Holds Off Rate Hike, Here's What To Watch

160,FCX,"The third quarter could finally be the bottom — after a year of the embattled, oversupplied energy sector pulling earnings of S&P 500 companies into negative terrain.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are forecast to dip 0.5% from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Given that actual results usually top analyst forecasts by a couple of percentage points, this could end a four-quarter earnings decline as the hangover from the oil price crash subsides. Revenue is set to grow 2.6%, ending six quarters of declines.Energy earnings are seen plunging 67%, but that's an improvement from declines of 85% in Q2 and an outright loss in Q1. In Q4, energy earnings are expected to see 3.8% growth as crude prices have rebounded from 12-year lows early this year to above $50 a barrel on Thursday. Leaving out the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are estimated to grow 2.9% in Q3.""The idea is that the worst is behind us,"" said Sheraz Mian, who manages Zacks' equity research department. ""We saw some early tentative signs of improvement in the last earnings season as well, even though growth was in the negative.  . . . But results were nevertheless an improvement over what was expected.""Financials will add a lift, with sector earnings forecast to tick up 1% vs. drops of 4% in Q2 and 12.6% in Q1. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on Friday, Oct. 14. Most banking stocks — with the notable exception of scandal-hit Wells Fargo — have been rallying in recent weeks on expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike.Broadly, the estimates reflect easier comparisons, particularly in energy and materials, whose results have slumped with the price of commodities. And the strong dollar still weighed during the quarter. But it didn't weigh as much as it could have because expectations have dimmed over the year for the Fed to be more aggressive about raising interest rates.Expectations in the months to come — including 8.4% earnings growth for Q4 — are higher but obtainable, Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio said. But while loftier forecasts typically get revised downward as the reporting season advances, earnings are still likely to grow in Q4 and early 2017 despite lingering economic anxiety.""I think the overall sentiment doesn't seem to have this positive outlook,"" he said. ""But when you look into the numbers, they're telling you a very different story.""The tech sector's earnings are expected to grow 4.5% in Q3 and 10.1% excluding Apple (AAPL), Aurelio said, demonstrating the company's weight in the index. In fact, taking Apple out of the S&P 500 overall would result in a slim 0.1% profit gain.But Aurelio pointed to pockets of resilience in the tech sector outside of Apple, which has been bogged down on concerns about slowing iPhone demand.In particular, he likes the odds of the semiconductor equipment segment, whose earnings are expected to grow 61% amid greater demand for technology that provides efficient memory storage. Applied Materials (AMAT) is among the leaders in the group, with earnings seen jumping more than 125% on nearly 40% revenue growth.""It's historically always been a gauge for where things are going, because it's supplying the equipment to make the devices that go into other devices,"" he said. ""It's supplying the equipment to make the chips.""The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of stocks has climbed 50% from a mid-February low to a 16-year closing high Thursday.Elsewhere, there are mixed signals. After posting double-digit-percentage earnings gains over the past year, the consumer discretionary sector is poised to slow to only 4.1% growth, according to Thomson Reuters.The expected slowdown comes largely from the auto industry, in particular Ford (F), with its anticipated 51% drop in earnings. The automaker in July indicated that sales could soon hit their peak, amid concerns about discounts and an auto-loan bubble. Take Ford out of the equation, and consumer discretionary's earnings would grow 7.9%, Aurelio said. General Motors' (GM) earnings should dip 4% after several quarters of more than double-digit gains.Amazon (AMZN), which is included in the consumer discretionary group, is seen doing some heavy lifting for the sector, with earnings growth expected to surge 371% in Q3.Elsewhere in the consumer-facing sector, restaurants across the board have warned of less customer spending, and retailers continue to suffer at the hands of Amazon.The materials sector, forecast to rebound to 7.1% earnings growth after a year of declines, is also seen getting a boost from a single heavy lifter.The section's drive into positive territory was due to the copper sub-industry, Aurelio said. The lone S&P 500 member of that mining subsector is Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose earnings are projected to soar 227%. Excluding Freeport, the materials sector's earnings would decline 0.6%.Labor costs in a variety of businesses — in retail, restaurants and even the airlines — could also mean lower profits. And while the health care sector is often immune to the cycles that hurt other businesses, earnings growth for the space is expected to slow to 5.5%. The sector overall is heading into tougher comparisons after getting a boost from the biotech industry in the past.So just as the shock from the oil bust is finally starting to fade, there's the sense that other big companies are losing momentum.""The growth cycle effectively has run its course for large-cap America as a whole,"" Mian said.Analysts expect industrial firms to report a 1.2% earnings decline, and that likely doesn't reflect Honeywell (HON) news. Honeywell late Thursday cut the top end of its 2016 earnings forecast, citing weak Q3 aerospace sales. Honeywell shares plunged 7.5% Friday, with aerospace customers and rivals also slumping.PPG Industries (PPG), maker of industrial coatings, paints and glass, crashed 8.3% Friday on a Q3 profit warning. Fellow S&P 500 paint component Sherwin-Williams (SHW) retreated 1.9%.

Shares still rose nearly 4%, but Red Hat ended below an 81.91 entry. Shares of Yahoo (YHOO) edged higher, unfazed by news that 500 million accounts were hacked.The Nasdaq gapped up to a fresh all-time high, rising 0.8%.

Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Wednesday's levels for a good part of Thursday's session, but trailed off by the close. Preliminary data showed volume coming in lower than Wednesday.IBD's Mining-Metal Ores  group popped 3% early amid a weak U.S. dollar, but the dollar fought back and the group was mostly unchanged near the close.

163,FCX,"Mining giants BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) are likely to boost capital returns to shareholders over the next two-plus years, Jefferies said, adding that demand has firmed up and supply has tightened across much of the industry.Australia-based iron ore miner BHP Billiton, which Jefferies upgraded to buy in part due to its valuation, jumped 3.3% to 32.69 in the stock market today. Shares broke out last week and remain in buy range.Jefferies said in a late Monday note that valuations in the sector were cheap and that the industry's free cash flow had strengthened. Its outlook comes months after many mining companies rolled back their dividend policies as weakening demand in China helped create an oversupply of iron ore and other commodities, leading companies to close mines, sell assets and slash spending.But those asset sales have helped prop up mining companies' balance sheets. Even though BHP reported its worst annual loss ever last week, its dividend is expected to increase due to what the company said was ""continued balance-sheet strength and strong free cash flow during the period.""Other mining stocks followed BHP upward on Tuesday. Rio Tinto climbed 1.65%. Brazil-based Vale (VALE), which also mines a lot of iron ore, added 1.6%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) rose 1.3%.IBD's TAKE: Many mining stocks are either forming or have cleared cup-with-handle bases. But a proper breakout hasn't always followed. Learn more about how to buy and sell stocks. While supply has yet to decline for iron ore and copper, ""the end of supply growth in both cases is in sight,"" Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina wrote.""While Chinese data have been mixed, mining-company management teams (Rio, BHP, Glencore, Anglo, Freeport, Vale and others) have recently noted that demand has stabilized or is modestly improving,"" LaFemina said. ""Leading indicators are mostly positive, and markets are balanced. With a lack of supply growth, flat demand is good enough to support commodity prices.""The mining industry has had a bumpy ride this year. Stocks have rallied amid speculation that economic stimulus in China would boost demand for steel and, alternately, have fizzled amid concerns that the demand wasn't there.But LaFemina argues that 2016 has turned out better than some expected.""Heading into 2016, it was clear that supply growth for most commodities would slow due to a 70% decline in mining capex (capital expenditure) from the peak. It was not clear that demand would stabilize,"" LaFemina later added. ""China stimulus sparked a recovery in construction and stability in demand. Strength in commodity prices has bailed out many leveraged miners. Asset sales at higher-than-expected valuations have been critically important as well.""Still, share prices hinge in large part on demand out of China, as well as a potential Fed rate hike in September, LaFemina wrote. A rate hike could strengthen the dollar, making dollar-denominated commodities a less appealing trade for people buying and selling them in weaker currencies.RELATED:

164,FCX,"BHP Billiton (BHP) reported a huge annual loss Tuesday but its dividend is expected to tick back up despite the mining giant having scrapped a progressive payout policy earlier. Shares rose Tuesday, trading intraday above a buy point before settling just below that.BHP in its 2016 annual earnings report Tuesday that it will pay an interim 14 cents dividend, comprised of the minimum pay out of 8 cents, and an additional 6 cents ""reflecting continued balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow during the period."" For the full year ended June 2016 it paid 78 cents per share in dividends, down from $1.24 in 2015.In February, BHP slashed its interim dividend by 75%, its first reduction since 1988, abandoning its earlier policy of increasing its dividend every six month for its biannual payouts. Commenting on the global outlook, the mining giant said it expects global growth for the rest of the year ""to remain modest and subject to downside risks, including the uncertain economic consequence of 'Brexit.' ""On China, it said ""The rate of growth in the Chinese economy appears to have stabilized"" and it expects China to hit its 6.5%-7% GDP growth target this year.The financial report comes as the mining industry emerges from a long period of depressed prices due to China's economic downturn and other factors that hit BHP, Vale (VALE), Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF), Rio Tinto (RIO), Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and others.The Australian miner and energy company of coal, gas, oil, iron ore and various other metals reported a $6.24 billion loss for the year ending June 30, better than the $7 billion loss many analysts expected.Revenue fell 31% to $30.91 billion from $44.64 billion in 2015.BHP reported underlying earnings of $12.3 billion and a profit margin of 41% ""despite weaker commodity prices, which had a negative impact of $10.7 billion."" On a per-share basis, the company reported a $1.20 per share loss, vs. a 66 cent a share profit in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Like other miners BHP Billiton took a drubbing last year amid depressed energy and minerals prices. Fundamentals are quickly improving and the mining group is among the top rated a strong 4 on IBD's list of 197 industries.The loss came in large part on the failure of the Samarco dam at an iron ore mine in Brazil by BHP and its partner in the mine, Vale. The dam burst killed 19 people and the mine has been closed since the Nov. 5, 2015 disaster.In its earnings statement, BHP said, ""Response efforts at Samarco continue with good progress being made on community resettlement, community health and environment restoration.""BHP Billiton shares closed up 1% at 31.50 in the stock market today. That's just below a 31.74 buy point from a two-and-a-half month long cup-with-handle base. BHP rose as high as 32.08.Vale jumped 2.6%, Cliffs Natural fell 5.3%, Rio Tinto rose 2.1% and Freeport McMoRan was down 0.8%.

167,FCX,"Finding a gold nugget is a lot easier if you search around a rich lode. In the same way, you're more likely to strike a winning trade if you focus on a strong industry group.Identifying industry trends not only helps narrow down where you are looking, but also exposes you to more potential ideas within a group. Group action that should get your attention includes heavier volume among a number of stocks in a particular group, a steep ascent among IBD's 197 industry rankings, or a lot of bullish technical setups in a group or sector.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) knows a little about finding gold. It belongs to IBD's industry group of metal ore miners. The group suffered from a five-year downtrend that saw a drop of 90% for the group's index value. At the end of April, it was showing signs of a rebound: Mining was the No. 1 sector of IBD's 33 sectors. The metal ores group had moved from No. 162, out of IBD's 197 groups, all the way to No. 36, while the No. 1 group at the time was a related group: miners of gold, silver and gems.It was in this environment that Freeport became one of the first trades when IBD's SwingTrader product launched.

It was added as a current trade at 11.48 on April 26 as it moved up strongly on a reversal after reporting earnings (1). The next day the stock followed-through on the reversal and was quickly up to its first 5% profit target, where half-profits were taken at 12.05 (2). The market was showing short-term topping action at the time, so booking partial profits at 5% was appropriate. It also hit the 10% profit target on the same day but was given more room to run given its strength.The following day, the strength continued in the stock early in the session but was looking weaker near the close (3). With the market also weakening, the remaining shares were sold at 12.81. The average exit price was 12.43 for a gain of 8.28% on the trade. The next day was tough to watch as the stock went up another 10%, but over the next two days it dropped sharply back and has barely traded above 12 since then. It's always nice in theory to sell right at the top, but in practice it's much tougher to do.Subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader can view the full details of this real-time trade, as well as the complete history of trades, in the Past Trades section of SwingTrader.

168,FCX,"Australian miner BHP Billiton (BHP) said Friday it would take a $7.2 billion write-down on its onshore U.S. shale assets due to low oil and gas prices, the latest bad news to come out of a mining industry that has suspended dividend payments as commodities dive.Like some other miners, BHP has steadily raised its dividend over time. But as commodity prices sink, in part due to weaker demand in China, mining giants such as Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Anglo American and Glencore have announced plans to suspend their dividends.BHP Billiton shares closed down 6.9% in the stock market today. Freeport-McMoRan rose 3.6% after sinking earlier, Vale (VALE) pared its losses to 2.9%, and Rio Tinto (RIO) gapped down to finish 6.3% lower.BHP Billiton said it will also cut its onshore U.S. operated rig count to 5 from 7 in the third quarter, adding that its spending plans for the rest of the year are ""under review, with a focus on preserving cash flow.""The company also cut its medium and long-term gas-price assumptions. But it said it expected oil prices to rebound, despite dimming its price expectations ""for the short to medium term.""Still, the write-down leaves the company with onshore U.S. assets of around $16 billion. In 2011, the Wall Street Journal said, the company invested around $20 billion into its shale and gas division amid a U.S. oil boom that flooded the market, ultimately driving prices down and hurting shale players.BHP also cited ""the disruption of OPEC and stronger-than-anticipated non-OPEC production"" as a factor in the oil-price drop. OPEC has opted to keep up oil production, pressuring U.S. companies even as some member nations, like Venezuela, want the cartel to let prices rise to shore up their economies.Freeport-McMoRan, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Anglo American are among the energy companies that have taken similar write-downs in recent months.BHP has also halted development of its dry gas acreage and is facing a $5.2 billion lawsuit related to a dam collapse at a mining facility it operates in a joint venture with Vale that wreaked havoc on the surrounding area.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

177,FCX,"Stocks dropped more than 2% in higher volume after China devalued its currency, fanning concerns about the world's No. 2 economy.The Nasdaq sank 3%, the S&P 500 declined 2.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.3%. Volume rose 22% on the NYSE and 20% on the Nasdaq compared to Wednesday, according to preliminary data.The stock market in Shanghai fell sharply overnight, tripping a circuit breaker that halted trading for the second time this week, after Beijing devalued the yuan by the most in five months. The devaluation, aimed at making China's exports more competitive, fanned worries that the nation's economy was slowing faster than expected.Oil, mining and steel stocks were among the biggest decliners in the stock market today amid worries about the outlook for demand. Oil fell more than 2%, adding to the previous day's 5% decline.Mining stock Freeport McMoRan (FCX) led the S&P 500 lower, sinking 9%. Oil producers Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Devon Energy (DVN) fell more than 8% and 7%, respectively. All three are more than 50% off their 52-week highs.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) shed more than 4% in heavy volume, closing below 100 for the first time since October 2014, after RBC Capital cut its price target to 130 from 140. The downgrade followed a report in Japan's Nikkei newspaper that cited unidentified suppliers as saying Apple would cut output of its iPhone 6s in the first three months of this year.In the IBD 50, Constellation Brands (STZ) was among the few bright spots. The producer of wines and other alcoholic beverages jumped more than 4% in huge volume after a better-than-expected earnings report.

178,FCX,"Stock futures powered up before Friday's open, boosted by rallying overseas markets and a sharp uptick in oil prices. Dow futures steered more than 200 points above fair market value, up 1.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 1.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were ahead 1.9%.The stock market today took some early strength from oil prices, which perked back above $31 a barrel, up more than 5% as a broad range of factors — including potential eurozone stimulus, terrorist attacks on Libyan oil sites, and cold weather in Europe and the U.S. — lifted prices and appeared to scare some short sellers out of their positions.Economic news starts with a preliminary estimate on January manufacturing from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET. December existing-home sales numbers are due out from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. Also at 10 a.m., the Conference Board reports its leading economic indicators index for December. Baker Hughes (BHI) reports its weekly oil rig count at 1 p.m.Oil and earnings reports were Friday's strongest early influences, but stocks for companies selling generators and emergency supplies also received an early boost as weather forecasters projected record-breaking snowfall across the mid-Atlantic beginning Friday afternoon. Emergency generator maker Generac (GNRC) jumped 5%, and Home Depot (HD) rose more than 1%.Dow stocks were generally positive. Nike (NKE) and Chevron (CVX) topped the index with 3% gains in premarket trade. American Express (AXP) slipped lowest, down 5%, although Q4 earnings and revenue declined less than expected.General Electric (GE) and Boeing (BA) both traded slightly lower. GE reported quarter results. Boeing said late Thursday it will take a Q4 charge.Oil- and energy-related plays posted most of the big gains on the S&P 500: Williams (WMB) swept up 7%; Marathon Oil (MRO) and Freeport-McMoran (FCX) vaulted 6% each.Irish drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) lapped the pack with a 9% gain. The stock is consolidating below its 10- and 40-week moving averages within a deep, five-month correction.Constellation Brands (STZ) muscled up nearly 4%. The stock remains extended after an August breakout and multiple touchbacks to its 10-week moving average.Starbucks (SBUX) slipped almost 3% before the open after reporting its fiscal Q1 results late Thursday.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) added 2% after its Q4 conference call, also after Thursday's close. The move implied an opening back above the 556.70 buy point around which the stock has been caught up, but premarket moves do not always carry through to regular trade.LinkedIn (LNKD) hammered out a 4% premarket gain. The professional networking site ended Thursday with a 3.3% loss this week after falling in seven of the past eight weeks.Overseas, rising oil prices and possible stimulus action in Europe helped boost China's markets. The Shanghai Composite rose 1.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.9%. That left Shanghai up a half-point and the Hang Seng down 2.3% for the week.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 bolted 5.9% higher, its biggest move in five months. Rising oil prices, a weakening yen and possible new stimulus measures in Europe were all factors. So was speculation that the Bank of Japan could adopt fresh monetary aid action at its meeting next week, according to Reuters.

"
181,FCX,"After four straight record years for dividend payouts, investors should expect muted payout growth, due in part to a sagging energy sector. This month could show the first monthly decline in the indicated rate — which forecasts the total dividends paid per share on a stock over the next 12 months if each were the same as the most recently paid out dividend — in more than five years.U.S. copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) this month suspended its per-share payout of 20 cents after slashing its dividend yield from 7% down to 1% earlier this year. Also in December, energy pipeline operator Kinder Morgan (KMI) hacked its dividend by 75%.While a stalling indicated rate may be a short-term blip, average dividend growth is decelerating, coming in just a shade under 10% as of Monday, down from last year's 12.7% increase, according to data compiled by S&P Dow Jones Indices.Excluding companies that at least doubled their dividends, the average hike for S&P 500 companies this year is 13.1%. Last year, it was 17.5%, and in 2013 it was 20.4%.'A Bit More Cautious'""Companies are a bit more cautious,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""The increases might slightly continue to decline, hopefully not as much.""As of Dec. 22, the $44.112 per share for indicated dividends — implying a payoff of slightly more than 2.1% per share — is only a fraction above November. If that turns out to be a decline once December numbers come in, it would be the first such decrease since February 2010.After taxes, corporate profits fell 1.7% in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Since dividends are paid out via earnings, companies are finding themselves in a position of wariness. With after-tax profit margins at historic highs and labor markets tightening, corporations will struggle to boost earnings amid sluggish global economic growth.December Dividend HikesDespite decelerating increases, 2015 stands to be a record year in terms of dividend payouts: $383.4 billion, a 9.2% increase over 2014. Amgen (AMGN), Boeing (BA) and Walt Disney (DIS) all announced big increases in December alone. Amgen is hiking its annual payout by 26.6% to $4 a share, Boeing 19.8% to $4.36 and Disney 7.6% to $1.42.Provided that the oil market doesn't fall apart, dividends should increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range, Silverblatt added.It shouldn't come as a big surprise. The big weight on dividends is an obvious culprit: energy, walloped by falling crude oil prices. U.S. crude traded at $105.24 per barrel on June 30, 2014. Earlier this month, it traded below $35 per barrel, hitting lows not seen since the Great Recession. Accordingly, energy has been the worst-performing sector among S&P 500 companies over the past year.One result has been the dreaded dividend cuts. Year to date, S&P energy issues have cut dividends by $6.2 billion, according to Silverblatt. During the previous five years combined, they cut dividends by $1.3 billion.Oil Majors Preserve DividendsWhile the likes of Freeport and Kinder Morgan already have slashed dividend payouts, large oil companies are staying the course. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Chevron (CVX) have maintained their dividends this year despite oil's ongoing price decline, choosing to cut capital spending instead.""Cutting a dividend is the kiss of death,"" Silverblatt said.Master limited partnerships — popular investment vehicles for energy pipeline and storage companies — had a rough year as prices for oil and other commodities sank. One barometer for the sector, the Alerian MLP (AMLP) exchange traded fund, has tumbled 34% this year.Corporate America's favorite short-term earnings fix, the stock buyback, should continue as companies are sitting on $1.3 trillion in cash, enough for buybacks and dividends, Silverblatt added. Continuing pressure from activist investors and other shareholders will only add to the practice of companies repurchasing their own shares.In general, stocks haven't had an outstanding year. Unlike the double-digit increases investors saw in 2013 and 2014, the Standard & Poor's 500 index generally has been flat for 2015, as the winners and losers have evened out the market.""If I were a stock picker, this was my year either to buy a summer house or live in a tent,"" Silverblatt said.

303,FCX,"Several top stocks from IBD's Leaderboard, a curated list of growth stocks to watch, could provide actionable trading opportunities in the coming week: Alibaba (BABA), Monster Beverage (MNST), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX).Among big-name tech stocks, Facebook (FB), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) still remain within buy range.Alibaba was added to Leaderboard as an options play ahead of its quarterly report last Thursday. Shares entered buy range from a long consolidation on Wednesday, gapped up to a 15-month high after the report and then continued higher Friday in heavy volume. If the stock quickly continues its run, it could soon enter the 20% profit-taking zone, but if it pulls back, as some leaders do, it could provide another buying opportunity.Monster Beverage first cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 154.06 on June 6, and it is currently flirting with the top end of the 5% buy range after finding support at its 50-day line. Despite missing EPS estimates earlier this month, shares are trading just 3% below their high reached in the wake of the report.Diamondback Energy is currently trading within buy range from a buy point at 92.92, and it's also forming a flat base with an entry at 96.11. The oil and gas exploration company is not a typical Leaderboard pick since it's a turnaround stock, but analysts expect profit to soar 126% next year.Mining company Freeport-McMoRan is another turnaround name that has performed well in 2016. Shares attempted a breakout past a cup-with-handle base on July 27, but they have since pulled back. Still, the declines have been relatively mild, which leaves open the possibility of another breakout. In the meantime, the stock is looking for support at its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Besides Leaderboard, IBD has several other sources for finding winning stocks primed for taking profits. The computer-generated IBD 50 highlights the top 50 growth stocks based on fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. With MarketSmith, you can find out which stocks are currently breaking out, are near buy points and more. And SwingTrader is a curated list of actionable trades that take advantage of short-term trends.Facebook is also a member of Leaderboard and leads its two peers with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. Shares cleared a flat-base buy point of 121.18 on July 20, and they are currently trading up only 3% from that level.Alphabet earns a 98 Composite Rating and is still in a buy zone after clearing a 791.05 buy point after gapping up on earnings. It is, however, extended 7% past a double-bottom entry at 753.58.Microsoft, which has posted sales declines for the past five quarters, has a 59 Composite Rating. Shares are up 2% from a consolidation entry at 56.95.Keep an eye on this sideways action, especially as the major indexes continue to climb to new highs.And two highly rated small-cap stocks, Alarm.com (ALRM) and Fabrinet (FN), are showing notable action ahead of their earnings reports after the close on Monday.Alarm.com hit a new all-time intraday high Friday in heavy volume and is extended 27% past a consolidation base buy point at 24.32. Now is the time to take at least partial profits if you haven't done so already -- especially ahead of earnings.Fabrinet re-entered buy range Friday from a flat base with a 39.15 buy point initially cleared on July 25, rising to a new all-time high in intraday trade in heavy volume.

But as prices rose regulators worried that a bubble was forming and on Monday the Dalian Commodity Exchange said it might raise transaction fees further to limit speculation.Weak Chinese trade data over the weekend also raised growth concerns.Last week, iron ore prices had their biggest weekly loss since October 2011, as ore with 62% content delivered to Qingdao fell 3.3% to $58.29 per metric ton.

321,FCX,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday that he expects his company to be producing 500,000 electric vehicles by 2018, with perhaps 1 million by 2020.On Friday, Rio Tinto (RIO) approved a $5.3 billion expansion of its copper and gold mine in Mongolia -- with production pegged to start in 2020 -- as it seeks to diversify away from its core iron ore mining business.Rio Tinto is one of the world's largest iron ore miners, but the growing use of copper, including in engines for electric vehicles made by Tesla Motors, General Motors (GM) and and others, is expected to spur the need for the metal, which could boost prices.Rio Tinto said Friday it will expand the mine underground, which it says has an average copper grade of 1.66%, more than three times higher than the open pit copper mine there.In a post in Rio's online magazine, Mines to Markets, the company noted that there are about 33 ounces of copper used in a conventional car, 66 to 88 ounces in a hybrid, and 132 ounces in a full EV such as a Tesla Model S, Nissan (NSANY) Leaf or General Motors' upcoming Bolt.Additionally, ""There are several mega trends that we see affecting the outlook for copper,"" Rio Tinto Copper analyst Ben Carstein said in the article, adding that ""China and other emerging markets -- despite some volatility over the short term -- will continue to positively influence long-term demand.""In a written statement, the U.K.-based mining company said that its board and its partners, the government of Mongolia and partner Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ), had approved development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper and gold mines, and development will start mid-year.""Today's investment takes it to another level and will transform Oyu Tolgoi into one of the most significant copper mines globally, unlocking 80% of its value,"" Rio Tinto Deputy Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques -- due to become CEO in July -- said in the statement.First production from the underground mines is expected in 2020. When it's fully ramped up, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce more than 500,000 tons of copper a year, up from the current 175,000-200,000 tons.Rio Tinto shares closed up 1.3% in the stock market today. The stock had fallen 62% from an intraday high of 59.33 on Aug. 1, 2014, to a low at 21.89 on Jan. 20 of this year amid a multiyear drop in commodity prices.

327,FCX,"Copper and mining stocks slumped Tuesday on concern that demand for metals is weakening following sluggish manufacturing data around the world.Most base metals retreated on the London Metal Exchange as the bourse reopened following a U.K. holiday on Monday. Anglo American (NGLOY) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) led declines among producers.A private factory gauge in top consumer China showed contraction for a 14th month, while data this week showed U.S. manufacturing growth cooled and a similar U.K. index unexpectedly shrank for the first time in three years in April. In Australia, one of the biggest metals producers, an interest-rate cut weakened its dollar, boosting the appeal of its exports.“There’s a lot of nervousness in the market,” Peter Thomas, a senior vice president at Zaner Group, a metals broker in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. If Chinese manufacturing “continues to contract, local demand is going to go down.”Copper for delivery in three months slipped 2.6% to settle at $4,920 a metric ton at 5:51 p.m. on the LME, the biggest loss since April 7. Prices retreated after closing on Friday at $5,050, the highest since March 22.Stockpiles of the metal in warehouses tracked by the LME climbed 3.5%, the most since August, on deliveries into Asia, bourse data show. Inventories are at the highest in six weeks.“Disappointing manufacturing data might be one of the reasons, but the unexpected rate decrease in Australia may also be a factor,” Eugen Weinberg, the head of commodities research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said by phone.A gauge of 18 large global base metal producers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence slumped 5.7%, set for the biggest loss since March 8. Anglo American plunged 13% in London, while Freeport lost 8.6% in New York.In other metals, aluminum, lead and zinc all declined more than 2% on the LME.

"
328,FCX,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

330,FCX,"Shares of mining companies such as Rio Tinto (RIO), Vale (VALE), BHP Billiton (BHP) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) got a lift Wednesday after Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen a day earlier signaled a cautious approach to raising the benchmark interest rate.Rio rose 4.2% in the stock market today, while Freeport advanced 1.6%. Vale leapt 8.5%, and BHP Billiton climbed 3.5%. The stocks did not move much on Tuesday.Heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) rose 1%, hitting a seven-month high.Mining stocks have tumbled since 2014 amid a commodities oversupply and inadequate demand from China, where economic growth has softened. The resulting slump in commodities prices has also made it more difficult for many mining companies to deal with debt accrued when the commodities market was stronger.But they have found more support this year around their 50-day lines, partly amid signs the Fed is likely to be more dovish on rate hikes after the one it implemented in December. Maintaining a lower interest rate keeps the dollar weaker against other currencies, which makes commodities denominated in dollars a more attractive trade on global markets.Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday, Yellen said she ""anticipates that only gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years,"" but stressed that approach could change.She said that ""global developments pose ongoing risks,"" among them a further weakening in China -- as it shifts to a consumer-based economy -- and commodity prices.Among other miners, Alcoa (AA) edged up 0.5%. Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) fell 2.3%.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
331,FCX,"Vale (VALE) indicated it would propose changing its dividend policy to one tailored more to actual financial conditions, as opposed to proposing a minimum payout each year, as the price of iron ore and other materials are set to fall further.A vote would on the proposed adjustments, which also include changing when the payments occur, are set to take place at the Brazilian mining giant's shareholder meeting on April 25, the Wall Street Journal reported.U.S.-listed shares of Vale closed up 5.2% in the stock market today. The stock has carved a path downward since 2014 amid the global commodities rout but has found support at its 200-day line this month. Mining peer Rio TintoRIO edged up 0.1%, BHP Billiton (BHP) added 0.5%, and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) climbed 3.7%.Commodity prices in general have rallied this year on the prospect of a weakening dollar, as well as more economic stimulus from China. But amid still-weak Chinese demand and more capacity set to come online from the mining industry's biggest players -- among other factors -- most don't expect the rise in prices to last.Vale's announcement comes after the company earlier this year proposed abandoning its dividend. The changes, if approved, would make Vale the latest mining company to take a more cautious approach to the way it pays shareholders in an attempt to save money and pay down debt.BHP Billiton cut its interim dividend last month. Across the sector, mining companies have considered selling off mines and other assets to buoy their balance sheet, and some analysts think steeper cuts are likely.

332,FCX,"Stocks remained lower Wednesday afternoon, as investors weighed the potential impact of the previous day's deadly terrorist bombings in Belgium.The Nasdaq was down 0.9%, hurt by declines in biotech stocks, while the S&P 500 lost 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.4%. Volume in the stock market today was running above Wednesday's levels.Oil, mining and steel stocks were among the day's biggest decliners, with crude oil and gold prices sliding. Retail and food stocks were among the best performers.Freeport McMoRan (FCX), a miner of gold, silver, copper and other metals, plunged more than 10% to lead the S&P 500 lower. Newmont Mining (NEM) dropped nearly 8%, falling below the 26.20 buy point of a long, deep cup-with-handle base.Mining, utilities and other defensive stocks have been in favor recently amid uncertainty in the global economy and volatile financial markets. But some growth stocks have had success.Chip stock Inphi (IPHI) jumped 7% to clear a 32.42 buy point of a cup base in heavy volume amid positive analyst comments following the company's announcement that it was launching a new chip for high-speed data networks.Universal Display (OLED) led most IBD 50 stocks lower, sinking almost 4% and falling below the 53.05 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. The maker of organic light-emitting diodes for flat panel displays broke out March 17, but volume was light.In economic news, sales of new homes rose 2% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512,000 units, edging above Wall Street forecasts, as gains in the U.S. West outweighed declines elsewhere. Also, January sales were revised higher.
"
333,FCX,"Shares of mining companies like Vale (VALE), Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) got a bump in the stock market today after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled it would be less aggressive in raising interest rates, a move that weakened the dollar and in turn boosted commodity prices.Vale jumped 6%, reclaiming its 50-day line, while Rio leapt nearly 4% and BHP climbed 5%. Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) shot up 12% and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) rose almost 7%, with both clinging to their 200-day lines.The stocks have all followed a similar pattern since 2014, which is to say they have all plummeted below those two key measures of support as commodity prices sank. Commodity prices have collapsed over the past couple of years, following a long spell of expansion in the mining sector, often financed with debt, when prices were high.But demand slowed as international economies weakened, leaving many in the sector with piles of excess minerals, debt that could be more difficult to reduce and mines that could be difficult to sell.However, lower interest rates generally push the dollar downward against other currencies. But when the dollar's value weakens, it makes the often-dollar-denominated commodities that mining companies depend on more attractive. The dollar fell to a five-month low Thursday in the wake of the Federal Reserve's more-gradual rate hike path.While iron ore prices have surged this year, in part on the prospect that China would take more action to buoy demand, the rally appears to be coming apart. BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie told CNBC this week that iron ore prices could continue to fall, even as other commodities find a bottom.Meanwhile, Rio Tinto said Thursday that Jean-Sebastien Jacques, the head of the company's copper & coal segment, would become Rio's CEO after current CEO Sam Walsh retires on July 1.
"
334,FCX,"BHP Billiton's (BHP) debt was downgraded on Thursday by Moody's, which said the Australian miner's credit was likely to stay ""substantially weaker"" than normal for at least the next year after a rout in iron ore prices has wrecked its top and bottom lines.In announcing its debt downgrade, to A3 from A1, Moody's cited slowing demand out of China and cuts in steel production, which lowers demand for the iron ore used to make it and drives down prices. BHP is one of the biggest iron ore miners in the world.""Moody's views there to have been a fundamental downward shift in the global mining sector, with the downturn being deeper and the recovery likely to take longer than previously expected,"" the ratings agency said in a statement.""This has resulted in increased credit risk and weaker financial metrics for companies across the global mining sector, including even the most resilient and highly-rated companies like BHP Billiton.""BHP's shares still managed to close up 1.8% in the stock market today in part on rising iron ore prices. Other mining stocks also rallied, with Vale (VALE) up 13%, Rio Tinto (RIO) 1.2%, and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) 1.6%. But Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) fell 3.2%.BHP has also been hit by the oil oversupply -- the mining giant also depends heavily on the petroleum business -- and the strong dollar, Moody's said.While Moody's said BHP's recent decisions to cut spending and end its policy of a steady or rising dividend were ""credit positive,"" their outlook on the company was negative. Other mining companies have similarly moved away from the kinder dividend payouts seen in previous years.Moody's initiated its review for downgrade on BHP's debt in December.A month later, it placed 175 companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, in the oil and mining sector on downgrade watch, saying low commodity costs could make it more difficult to for the companies to manage their debt, much of which was incurred to expand in attempt to cash in when prices were higher. Most of those reviews are set to conclude by the end of the first quarter.The credit downrgade comes a day after BHP, Vale and their joint venture Samarco reached what might be a cheaper settlement than the Brazilian government wanted over a dam burst at a Samarco facility in November that killed at least 17 people, wiped out nearby properties and caused extensive pollution.Under the terms of the settlement announced Wednesday, Samarco will put around $1.1 billion over the next three years toward an environmental cleanup and restoration foundation, which will be set up by Samarco and its two joint owners. In the three years after that, Samarco's annual contributions will range from roughly $200 million to roughly $400 million.Brazil sued the companies in November, but was seeking $5.2 billion.

336,FCX,"Brazilian mining giant Vale (VALE), the largest miner of iron ore, said Thursday it might consider asset sales to cut debt after reporting its worst loss in nearly 20 years amid sinking ore prices and the nation's weakening currency.The company's openness to such sales would follow Anglo American, which plans to slash the number of its assets to 16 mines from 45, and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which is selling a 13% stake in a key Arizona copper mine.But as commodity prices sink due to weaker demand from China, getting a good deal on asset sales could be difficult, and tougher cuts may be ahead for the sector.Vale's Q4 loss deepened to $8.57 billion from $1.85 billion, dragged mostly by impairment charges. On a per share basis, the loss was $1.66, far worse than views for a loss of a penny a share.Revenue sank 35% to $5.9 billion, falling short of forecasts for $6.24 billion.Shares closed down 4.4% in the stock market today.The results come as Vale grapples with trouble beyond the commodities bust. In November, a dam at a facility in Brazil run by the company's Samarco joint venture with BHP Billiton (BHP) burst and killed 17 people, obliterated nearby homes, and spewed mud and other waste into the Doce River, resulting in multibillion-dollar legal challenges.""We have been working diligently with Samarco since the beginning and will remain fully committed to supporting the people and the environment of the affected regions,"" Vale said in a statement Thursday.State authorities in Brazil this week also accused executives of Samarco with homicide in connection with the incident, and investors in the U.S. sued BHP Billiton on grounds the Australian mining company misled them about safety protocols before the accident.Vale ended the year with $ 28.85 billion in gross debt, roughly in line with its debt last year. Similar to other debt-ridden mining companies, Vale has proposed ending its dividends to preserve money, but the measure still awaits approval.Still, the company said the price in iron ore has become more favorable as mines close in China, Reuters reported.In a recent research note, Jefferies sees Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP as most able to weather the current downturn.Rio Tinto shares slipped 1.1%. BHP Billiton ticked up 0.1% while Freeport fell 1.1%. 
"
337,FCX,"On Monday, BHP Billiton (BHP) became the latest mining giant to announce a tough self-assessment, though doubts on how effective its peers' restructuring plans are could mean more pain ahead.The drastic changes come after China's slowing economy pushed down commodities prices and undercut years of debt-financed expansion. But Jefferies indicated in research notes this month that giants like Anglo American, Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Rio Tinto (RIO) have to do more.BHP Billiton slashed its interim dividend -- the first cut in nearly 30 years -- to 16 cents a share from 62 cents and abandoned its progressive dividend policy in favor of one that provides a payout of at least 50% of underlying attributable profit. The company will also cut capital spending this year and next year by a total of $3.5 billion.Additionally, the company will reorganize its mining operations into two segments, Minerals Australian and Minerals Americas, and the presidents of iron ore and petroleum will leave.""We expect this to all be a relatively seamless transition, and the end result should be further cost cutting as redundant functions throughout BHP are eliminated,"" Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina wrote in a research note Monday. ""Tough times call for tough measures.""BHP Billiton closed down 4.7% in the stock market today. Freeport-McMoRan gapped down 8.7%. Rio Tinto lost 3.85%, and Vale (VALE), which reports Thursday, sank 6.9%.Mining stocks have been pummeled over the past two years amid the commodity oversupply. Plans to expand into oil when prices were more favorable have come back to haunt companies like BHP and Freeport as the U.S. oil boom over the past decade grew overheated.Anglo American, which has also suspended its dividend, said last week that it will pull out of iron ore and coal to focus on its operations in diamonds, copper and platinum. Over time, the result would be a dramatically smaller company, with 50,000 employees as compared to 135,000 at the end of last year -- a Herculean effort that might make Wall Street happy but could be difficult to pull off.""It is a very difficult environment for mining companies to sell assets that are not world class,"" LaFemina wrote last week. ""In the case of iron ore and coal, even world class assets would likely be difficult to sell at anything better than distressed prices.""Meanwhile, Freeport-McMoRan, another recent dividend suspender, said that it would sell a 13% stake in its Morenci copper mine in Arizona to Japan-based Sumitomo Metal Mining for $1 billion.The sale ""will help Freeport pay down some of this debt ahead of schedule, but more work is needed. We expect the company to pursue additional asset stake sales in the near future,"" LaFemina wrote, with more sell-offs of parts of the Freeport's copper business likely.Rio Tinto, meanwhile, also this month replaces its never-falling dividend policy with one intended to be more flexible. The company said that it expects its 2016 dividend won't be less than $1.10 a share. Rio declared a dividend of $2.15 a share for last year.But after this year, Rio will move to a dividend that pays 40%-60% of underlying profits, Jefferies said last week, the midpoint of which ""implies a $0.78 per share dividend for 2017.""""Cyclical cost deflation in mining is slowing, and Rio's easy cost cutting is mostly done,"" LaFemina wrote. ""Further cost cuts will be hard work. The problem with this is that Rio will be less able to offset further price declines with lower operating costs.""Jefferies sees Rio better positioned than many of its rivals, saying that its debt would likely fall this year. But Jefferies also said that this year should still be a bumpy ride for the stock.

342,FCX,"Vale's (VALE) bid for up to 15% of Australian mining company Fortescue Metals Group could result in a joint venture that challenges mining giants Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) in the key Chinese market.Fortescue said Tuesday that it signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Brazilian mining company Vale, which will buy a 5%-15% stake in the Australian company ""and potentially invest in its existing and prospective mines.""The Vale-Fortescue pact could lead to a joint venture that would mix Fortescue's low-grade-but-pure iron ore with Vale's high-grade-but-less-pure ore in a blend suited to the needs of Chinese steel factories.Shares of Vale closed down 14% in the stock market today on a warning that the recent uptrend in commodities may not last.

344,FCX,"Despite a dip Thursday morning following a disappointing earnings announcement, shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) have been on a sharp rise over the last month amid a rebound in the price of gold, with the gold and copper producer also announcing a change in its executive ranks.Late Wednesday, Newmont Mining fell short of Q4 earnings estimates but beat revenue views. The company reported its fourth straight year of lower EPS. However, its top line improved for the first time since 2011.Also Wednesday, the Colorado-based company announced that Tom Palmer will succeed Chris Robison as executive vice president and chief operating officer on May 1. Robison is retiring after a 36-year career in the mining industry. Palmer joined Newmont in March 2014 after two decades with U.K.-based Rio Tinto (RIO), where he helped oversee the bauxite and alumina, coal, copper and iron ore businesses.Meanwhile, the entire mining sector has benefited from a recent uptick in gold prices. Those prices are up 15% since mid-December, when they hit their lowest point since October 2009.The metal has benefited from unsteady stock markets, which often cause investors to flock to gold and cash. Gold miners have also gotten a boost from the dollar’s strength in key gold producing countries such as Australia and Canada. This gives miners a relative boost for each dollar of gold sold and earnings booked.The upshot for Newmont is a share price that has risen more than 45% since Jan. 19 in heavier-than-normal volume — an indication that a lot of smart money is moving into the stock. Fellow gold producers Randgold Resources (GOLD), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Anglogold Ashanti (AU) have seen similarly robust spikes, though the latter firm has done so off of a much smaller base. Freeport-McMoRan and Anglogold are losing money.Newmont shares closed up 0.9% on the stock market today. Randgold rose 3.6%, while Freeport-McMoRan dipped 0.1% and Anglogold climbed 5.2%. Rio Tinto lost 1.7%.

Analysts expected an unchanged tally of 61.Europe's market continued to trade mixed, with Frankfurt's DAX down 0.6%, Paris' CAC 40 up 0.2% and the FTSE 100 in London climbing 0.7% in afternoon trade. All three indexes posted solid rallies while U.S. markets were closed Monday.Oil prices continued to trade moderately higher, up a bit less than 1%, after news of a possible production agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar. The agreement would halt output at January's high levels, and require production ceilings on Iran and Iraq, recovering producers which analysts generally see as unlikely to commit to what for them would be low-level curbs.On the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Home Depot (HD) added more than 2% each. Intel (INTC) was the index's worst early performer, down 0.6%.ADT (ADT) topped the S&P 500 with a 51% gain.

The diamond seller reported less than 1% of its annual trading volume was executed on the LSE, making the expense of maintaining its market status there more weighty than the benefits.Among IBD 50 stocks, TAL Education (XRS) rumbled almost 7% higher in huge trade. That put the stock well above its 10-week moving average and about 2% from a 48.94 buy point in six week flat base. The stock had tripped a sell rule last week by diving more than 8% below that buy point.Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) pared gains, but remained up 4% in strong trade. The hospital and surgical center operator  reported fourth quarter earnings in line with, and revenue growth well above analyst consensus expectations.

384,FCX,"The metal ores mining industry is helping to lead the market Tuesday, as a rebound in some commodities helps the metals sector snap out of a funk. But there are precious few mining stocks in buy areas or new bases, and the earnings outlook for the raw-materials sector is dimming. The mining group's best chart belongs to Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). The…

385,FCX,"Federal Reserve policymakers caught markets off-guard in December when a number of them built President Trump's planned fiscal stimulus into their hawkish forecast for three rate hikes in 2017.Fed members may have taken their cue from investors, who lit a fire under the shares of companies that stand to benefit from a big infrastructure push: equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), cement makers Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC), and copper miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX). Meanwhile shares of Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) flew on prospects for higher rates and a steepening yield curve, as well as deregulation hopes.But after a tumultuous first week and a half of his presidency, Fed policymakers are likely done trying to predict what Trump will do and how his policies will affect the economy. Now the Fed, like investors, is in wait-and-see mode to watch what can get through Congress, when it will affect the real economy, and whether Trump's immigration and trade policies curb or offset the force of his pro-growth moves.Policymakers are virtually certain to leave the central bank's key interest rate unchanged at the two-day meeting that will wrap up with a statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Financial markets, which are pricing in just 4% odds of a rate hike, currently expect two rate hikes this year, coming in June and December. Investors will be looking for any hints that the Fed will instead stick to the trajectory of three rate hikes in 2017 that was implied by policymakers' forecasts issued after the December meeting.But don't expect any clarity on Wednesday. Chair Janet Yellen doesn't have a news conference scheduled and member projections won't be updated until March.After fourth-quarter GDP came in at a softer-than-expected 1.9%, with full-year growth of 1.6% the weakest since 2011, the economic data aren't yet conclusively pointing to an acceleration in growth. While business and consumer sentiment indicators have been suggesting that the economy could take off, the Fed has good reason to be patient and leave the stage to Trump for now.RELATED:Why Trump Immigration Order May Weigh On StocksTrump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall — Or Not

387,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) swung to a fourth-quarter profit as copper prices recovered, but earnings fell well short of forecasts, sending shares lower Wednesday after a prior-day surge.The miner earned 25 cents per share, missing estimates of 34 cents, reversing a year-ago loss of 2 cents a share. Revenue jumped 24.5% to $4.377 billion but came in shy of the $4.42 billion consensus.CEO Richard Adkerson painted a positive picture about the outlook in the conference call, expressing confidence in a ""bright future for copper"" with future ""deficits in the marketplace"" looking like a sure thing.Yet the near-term picture for the miner is clouded by uncertainty in its Indonesia operations, where ""productivity issues"" at its Grasberg mine contributed to a shortfall in revenue, Adkerson said. A bigger concern involves uncertainty over the ability to export out of Indonesia under new government regulations.While Adkerson said that the government has indicated exports won't be restrained, license approval hasn't yet been secured. Noting that the company isn't in position to build up inventories in Indonesia, Adkerson said there's potential for a big impact on the company, including layoffs and a cutback in capital spending.Troubles in Indonesia come as everything else seems to be falling into place for Freeport, which has sharply curtailed its debt and stands to benefit from further rises in the price of copper.""As we enter 2017, we are enthusiastic about opportunities to generate future values for shareholders through our portfolio of high-quality, long-lived copper resources,"" Adkerson said in a statement.Freeport shares shot out of a nine-week base on Tuesday, clearing a buy point at 16.03 and closing up 8.3% at 17.02. Shares pulled back below that buy point for a while on Wednesday but ended the regular session down 3.1% to 16.50 on the stock market today.Shares of rival BHP Billiton (BHP) ticked up 0.3% to 41.68 at the close, while Vale (VALE) inched up 2 cents to 10.78 and Rio Tinto (RIO) added 0.6% to 45.96.IBD'S TAKE: Freeport-McMoRan is among the Leaderboard stocks IBD's top market writers track on a daily basis to help readers spot buying opportunities when they emerge and sell signals to lock in profits.Freeport's second breakout since Donald Trump's electoral victory came as the price of copper hit its highest level in more than a year, lifted by hopes for a major infrastructure push in the U.S. as well as potential supply issues.Meanwhile, BHP faces a potential strike at a copper mine that produces 5% of global output. Earlier Wednesday, BHP cut its yearly copper production forecast, helping fuel the rally in prices.RELATED:S&P 500, Nasdaq Hit Highs As Trump-Tied Issues ThriveOption Trading: Freeport, PayPal, Proofpoint Set Up Ahead Of Earnings

They include regulatory policy, public perception, safety and privacy.The Federal Aviation Administration is working on regulations for commercial drone operations in U.S. airspace. Companies hope to use drones for such tasks as inspecting crops and pipelines, news gathering and even package delivery if Amazon.com (AMZN) has its way.Companies that have received special exemptions from the FAA to fly their drones include food-processing and commodities giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), infrastructure service firm Aecom Technology (ACM), commercial drone maker AeroVironment (AVAV), mining company Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), engineering services firm Oceaneering International (OII) and GPS company Trimble Navigation (TRMB).

Copper fell to $5,571.50 a ton, its lowest point in five and a half years, Reuters said.Weaker growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, is impacting sales of copper, which is used in housing, electronics, autos and other industries.The Mining-Metal Ores group is ranked a near-worst 190 on IBD's list of 197 industries.Shares of diversified copper-gold-silver miner Freeport McMoRan plunged early and were down 12.2% in afternoon trading on the stock market today.The Phoenix, Ariz.-based mining stock hasn't offered a buy point recently, as it dropped 53% from a July 9 high and is trading well below its 50-day and 200-day averages.BHP Billiton (BHP), the largest company by market capitalization in the mining group, fell 4.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Like Freeport, it's fallen steadily since midsummer and was trading at the lowest point since March 2009.In August, BHP said that it would separate into two companies, a simplified company with iron ore, copper, coal, petroleum and potash, and a new company that would would have aluminum, nickel, coal, silver and manganese assets. A shareholder vote is slated for May on the demerger proposal.Glencore, one of the largest copper miners, has the largest exposure on copper. Last summer, Glencore approached Australia's Rio Tinto (RIO) about a possible merger. It was rebuffed, and analysts said that the plunge in copper's price probably rules out any new talks between them, at least for now. Glencore, which trades on the London exchange and over the counter in the U.S. as GLNCY, fell 4%. Rio Tinto slid 2.7%.Southern Copper (SCCO), another Phoenix-based miner that operates mining, smelting and refining facilities in Peru and Mexico, dipped 5%.Anglo American, a London-based company trading over the counter in the U.S. as AAUKY, is the world's largest platinum producer and also mines copper and other metals. Anglo American was down 7.5%.Global X Copper Miners (COPX), an exchange traded fund, also plumbed new lows. Global X gapped down 8.5% to 6.15. As recently as July 29, it was 82% higher at 11.21.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

483,FCX,"Alcoa (AA) is poised to report fiscal third-quarter earnings results Wednesday amid an expansion drive to make next-generation jetliners.Like other mining and metals companies, Alcoa has been hurt by a multiyear slump in prices amid a glut of metals.The company hopes that use of lighter weight aluminum composite materials in jetliners and cars will lift prices. But slowing economic growth in China, the world's biggest consumer market, is a concern.Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for New York-based Alcoa to report a doubling of earnings to 22 cents per share vs. the same period a year ago, on a 1.2% hike in revenue to $5.84 billion.The bar is set high. Despite industry doldrums, Alcoa has topped Wall Street estimates in six of the last eight quarters and beaten them the last two periods in a row.On Oct. 2, Alcoa announced the opening of the world's largest manufacturing plant for lightweight aluminum-lithium in Lafayette, Ind. The company said at the time that it wants to be the industry leader in this segment.""The future of aviation is being built with aluminum-lithium, and Alcoa is making big moves to capture that demand,"" CEO Klaus Kleinfeld said in a statement.Alcoa already has contracts for $100 million in aluminum-lithium for jetliners lined up for 2017. Customers include European aerospace consortium EADS (EADSY), which makes the Airbus A380 wide-body jetliner, and Boeing (BA) for its technologically advanced 787 Dreamliner.Alcoa also sells to automakers as they move to the lighter material to meet tougher federal gas mileage standards.Ford Motor (F)was expected to begin shipping a mostly aluminum body and cab version of its F-150 pickup, the best-selling vehicle in the U.S., this quarter.

Copper sales volumes were lower than the year-ago figure of 1.1 billion, which mainly reflects lower sales volume at Cerro Verde and in North America. Gold sales also fell year over year mainly reflecting lower mill rates at PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI).According to Freeport, during 2017 the company benefited from improved market conditions for copper, focus on productivity and cost and capital discipline.Freeport-McMoran, Inc.

485,FCX,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals. These include aluminum and gold, other precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
486,FCX,"Iron and steel commands the largest segment of the global metals market. They comprise more than half the metals industry in terms of volume, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products. These include pipe and tube, wire and spring, rolls and bars.
"
487,FCX,"The precious metal and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
488,FCX,"The global metal industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically it has suffered from overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The recent focus on the weakening outlook for global economic growth has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. These near-term challenges aside, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and Outlook 
"
489,FCX,"Steel
"
490,FCX,"As the major stakeholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. Recovery, however, has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production reached a record level of 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump. This trend has largely remained in place this year, though the emerging growth worries will likely force some producers to take production off-line.
"
491,FCX,"China remains the largest steel-producing country, accounting for roughly half of all global production at 46%, though its first quarter 2012 volumes were barely up from the year-earlier level. Japan, the second largest producer, posted a 4.1% decline.  The U.S. is in the third position, though its first quarter production was 9.2% higher year over year. North American crude steel production was up 7.7% in the first quarter, Asia was flat, while Europe dipped 3.8%. In April 2012, world crude steel production was down 3% from March, but up 1% from the April 2011 levels.
"
492,FCX,"As we look into the first quarter results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) -- we find revenues benefitted from higher average steel prices. On the volume front, ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel saw a rise, while Nucor and AK Steel suffered declines. Revenues increased at all the companies except AK Steel. However, we note margin compression across the board.
"
493,FCX,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has shown significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached their highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first five months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.4 million SAAR. Many auto manufacturers made their best Memorial Day sales in over five years. Motor vehicle sales were at 13.8 million in May, declining from 14.4 million in April. Even though sales slid to the lowest level so far in 2012, it is still better than consensus expectations from the beginning of the year. On a year-over-year basis, sales increased 26% in May.
"
494,FCX,"The construction sector has been a drag on steel companies’ earnings. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 48.4 in April 2012. This followed a 50.4 reading in March, and of significance since any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. After remaining at a level over 50 for five consecutive months, the index has slipped into negative territory. Given the continued uncertainty in the market, we do not expect any immediate recovery in this sector.
"
495,FCX,"The residential construction market has improved in recent months, but the pace of improvement has been very slow and halting. This means that this end market is unlikely to emerge as a key growth driver for steel producers any time soon.
"
496,FCX,"The World Steel Association projects global steel usage to rise 3.6% in 2012, a sharp deceleration from 2011’s 5.6% growth. This reflects continuing slowdown of Chinese steel demand and Eurozone debt crisis uncertainties. Questions about the U.S. growth outlook make another cloud on the horizon.
"
497,FCX,"China’s steel use in 2012 is estimated to grow 4% to 648.8 million tons, following 6.2% growth in 2011. The slackening is due to the economy entering a less steel-intensive growth phase as a result of the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy and restrain the real estate bubble. After a weak performance in 2011, India is expected to grow by 6.9% to reach 72.5 Mt.
"
498,FCX,"Apparent steel use in the U.S. is forecast to grow 5.7% in 2012. In Central and South America, apparent steel use will attain a historical high of 49.1 Mt, up 6.8% in 2012. Brazil is expected to return to positive growth. Japan’s steel use is expected to drop 0.6% to 63.7 Mt in 2012 due to the impact of exchange rate appreciation, despite the reconstruction efforts following the March 2011 earthquake.
"
499,FCX,"Steel usage in the European Union is expected to decline by 1.2% to 150.9 Mt in 2012 as  sovereign debt problems persist. Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker by volume and Europe's largest steelmaker, had earlier decided to idle five of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe and announced the extended idling of a number of facilities. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations.
"
500,FCX,"Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred. To reduce its exposure to Europe, the company recently sold its 24% share in European energy company Enovos International.
"
501,FCX,"To sum it up, despite relatively over-supplied conditions and softening prices, the outlook for the sector is not that bad. Prices could potentially stabilize, as visibility on the economic growth questions of countries like China, India and South Korea improves. The outlook for key end-markets in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors remains favorable. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the industry.
"
502,FCX," Gold
"
503,FCX,"As per the World Gold Council, last year was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
504,FCX,"In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, gold demand was at 1097.6 tons, a 5% year over year decline. Increase in investment demand was offset by declines in demand for jewelry and in the technology sectors, due to higher prices. Central banks continued to be purchasers of gold, accounting for around 7% of total gold demand, at 80.8 tons.
"
505,FCX,"However, in absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $59.7 billion, a 16% jump compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the first quarter stood at $1,690.57. This was 22% above the prior fiscal’s quarter. In value terms, all the sectors of gold demand posted growth, barring physical bars and the official sector.
"
506,FCX,"Investment demand posted robust growth in the quarter, particularly led by ETFs and similar products. Gold demand in the technology sector was at 107.7 tons, a 7% decline year-over-year due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, higher inventories and the uncertainty in Europe.
"
507,FCX,"Jewelry demand dipped 6% to 519.8 tons due to higher price levels. The 22% higher quarterly average price suggests that jewelry demand is not directly related to price. Value of jewelry demand grew 14% to a record $28.3 billion. China, Russia and Egypt recorded growth, while weakness was witnessed in India, a number of Middle Eastern markets and in Europe.
"
508,FCX,"Jewelry demand in India, otherwise a major consumer of gold, was down 19% and investment demand declined 46%. This was mainly due to a sharp decline in the rupee, which led to higher local prices, rise in import taxes on gold and imposition of excise duty on jewelry in that country. However the excise duty was later withdrawn by the government. Gold in India is currently at an all-time high in rupee terms.
"
509,FCX,"In China, demand for gold increased 10% to a record high of 255.5 tons. China remained the largest jewelry market for the third consecutive quarter. Boosted by the local New Year holiday earlier this year, jewelry demand was at 156.6 tons, up 8% year over year, and accounting for 30% of global jewelry demand. Even though the pace of growth is slowing, gold demand remains high due to rising income levels, urbanization, economic growth and inflation.
"
510,FCX,"Mine production increased to 673.8 tons, up 3% year over year. The additional supply came from new projects coming on stream and the continued ramping up of projects that entered into production two to three years ago across the globe. Recycling activity increased 11% to 391.5 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,070.3 tons, up 5% year over year.
"
511,FCX,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce in 2011. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,657 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect this year to be stellar for gold.
"
512,FCX,"It also remains a coveted asset, given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis promoted gold as a currency hedge for European investors. Lingering economic concerns, higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, the relentless Euro-zone debt crisis and a still-high American unemployment rate will continue to support gold prices this year, as well.
"
513,FCX,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers, and is considered a safe-haven investment. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continue to rebound, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
514,FCX,"Analyzing the results of the gold companies in our coverage -- Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM  -  Free Report) -- we find that first-quarter profits were driven by higher average realized gold prices. As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as these will benefit. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross are slated to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
515,FCX,"Ironically, rallying gold prices have not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term Neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold, rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may have labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.Aluminum
"
516,FCX,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.

517,FCX,"In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Alcoa, Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, reported better-than-expected results on the back of growth in the aerospace and automobile sectors.
"
518,FCX,"The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up by 7% this year. It also expects that burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012. Region-wise, in 2012, China and India are expected to lead with double-digit growth. Russia and Brazil are projected to have 4% to 5% increases in aluminum consumption rates. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
519,FCX,"Alcoa’s positive outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Rio Tinto (RIO) plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs. Alcoa plans to close or curtail 390,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining, by 2015 and improve its competitiveness.
"
520,FCX,"This trend will continue until aluminum prices recover.  Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been trending down lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up action to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
521,FCX,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve globally. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets.
"
522,FCX,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and its light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
523,FCX,"Further, the surge in copper prices this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical metal. In response to the spurt in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
524,FCX,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
525,FCX,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, or Chalco  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
526,FCX,"Copper is a major industrial metal, with its price strongly correlated with the outlook for economic growth. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
527,FCX,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage reflects its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
528,FCX,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies resulted in high copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound, due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
529,FCX,"However, copper prices have since improved, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. During 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.39 per pound to $3.93 per pound, averaging $3.77. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
530,FCX,"Notwithstanding the volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper prices. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
531,FCX,"Despite near-term challenges, the outlook for the copper remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
532,FCX," Overall Industry Outlook
"
533,FCX,"Growth in the emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. In the developed world, Europe’s problems have likely pushed it into a recession already, which will have residual effects elsewhere in the world. The U.S. economy, which looked very promising earlier this year, no longer offers a robust picture.
"
534,FCX,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
"
535,FCX,"The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the economy’s momentum. But the Fed’s ability to make a meaningful change may be limited in the absence of fiscal measures that are unlikely to come through in this election year.
"
536,FCX,"With all the fears about the Chinese economy slowing down from 10% to sub 7% growth, it's no wonder that cyclical sectors like industrials, materials, and energy have been the laggards in the past year. Indeed, it's almost enough to make an investor ask if the global boom is winding down as the strongest developing engine sputters.
"
537,FCX,"Here's what the broad sectors look like in the past year...
"
538,FCX,"But, the stock market is at nearly four-year highs and many cyclical stocks have contributed greatly to the push higher because the global economy is in better shape than most strategists predicted a couple of quarters ago. So it helps to look at the ""market of stocks"" as well to sort out the winners from the losers.
"
539,FCX,"Below is performance comparison for 8 cyclical stocks over the past 6 months, not far from the 52-week lows for the indexes and many of these names. I am showing an energy concentration to highlight a broad and deep sector where stock-picking mattered a lot, even with crude oil surging to $110 a barrel.
"
540,FCX,"Big Winners: CAT, NOV, EOG
"
541,FCX,"What do Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), National Oilwell Varco (NOV), and EOG Resources (EOG) have in common besides surging about 35% in the past 180 days? 
"
542,FCX,"Each has dominated their industry with earnings momentum. CAT is the dominant maker of heavy construction machinery with strong sales to China and other developing economies. NOV provides equipment and services to energy E&Ps and maintains high margins doing it. And EOG is one of the winners in domestic production of oil from North American shale deposits.
"
543,FCX,"Under-Performers: FCX, JOY, APC
"
544,FCX,"Metals and mining have been softer sectors as China slows its pace of infrastructure development. Early in the week, we heard from giant iron ore miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto that they see less demand for the essential steel-making ingredient this year as their biggest customer turns focus to other areas of her economic future and tries to release the hot air from a levitating real estate bubble. Clearly Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX  -  Free Report) and Joy Global (JOY) have felt the slow down.
"
545,FCX,"Anadarko Petroleum (APC) is a quality E&P that is still making the transition away from heavy natural gas production. Since that efficient, clean-burning ""fuel of the future"" is so abundant and so darn cheap, many producers like APC have seen a decline in profits in the past few quarters. This has also been a problem for JOY as nat gas competes with coal and wins at these prices. Thus demand for machinery to mine coal has seen a decline. 
"
546,FCX,"The Biggest Loser: BHIBaker Hughes (BHI), continues the theme of ""nat gas blues"" that I wrote about last week. BHI bought another oilfield services company, BJ Services, last year and has had to spend considerable time and resources shifting its business away from nat gas rigs to more ""oily"" liquids and petroleum equivalents.
"
547,FCX,"On Wednesday, BHI warned that operating profit before tax for the first quarter is expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2011 because of ""rapidly changing"" market conditions as described above.
"
548,FCX,"The Market Performer
"
549,FCX,"I put Exxon Mobil (XOM) into the mix just because they are the biggest and most-diversifed of energy companies. It should be no surprise that their fortunes are more balanced in this regard, with neither gangbuster growth, nor over-exposure to any one sub-industry of oil and gas companies. And obviously, with a large market-cap weighting in the S&P 500, it's performance and beta are highly correlated to the index.
"
550,FCX,"I am very curious to see if the energy sector catches up to the rest of the market in the next few months on higher oil and gas prices. I will revisit this topic and these names during the April-May earnings season. Either way, good stock-picking in strong sub-industries will remain crucial to investment out-performance.

552,FCX,"About the Industry
"
553,FCX,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
554,FCX,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
555,FCX,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.Overall Industry Outlook
"
556,FCX,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets.
"
557,FCX,"Profitability at the individual company level depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones own fewer mines.
"
558,FCX,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn and the focus shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
559,FCX,"However, reversing the trend, 2010 witnessed a surge in mining deals as the rise in commodity prices, economic recovery, demand in developing markets, growing scarcity of resources and refreshed balance sheets spurred merger activity.
"
560,FCX,"2011 was a busy year in terms of M&A activity despite the European debt crisis, earthquake in Japan, social unrest in the Middle East, and downgrade of the U.S. government’s debt rating. We expect the momentum in M&A to sustain in 2012 as well. Armed with healthy balance sheets, reduced economic uncertainty and a pent-up demand for new projects, we expect the companies in the industry to accelerate deal activity with a re-focus on consolidation.
"
561,FCX,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
562,FCX,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
563,FCX,"The Glencore-Xstrata merger currently in the offing is one of the biggest ever in the mining sector. If it materializes, it would result in a combined new business of $90 billion and will be the world's biggest exporter of coal for power plants and the largest producer of zinc. This will be the largest mining transaction in history, dwarfing the earlier major deals like Rio Tinto-Alcan in 2007 and Vale-Inco in 2006.
"
564,FCX,"Demand in the metals and mining industry has benefitted from the strong growth in emerging markets. China and India in particular, are witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term.
"
565,FCX,"China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so in the future. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
566,FCX,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan had been recently affected, as factories were shut down in the aftermath of the country’s strongest earthquake and tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore.
"
567,FCX,"We believe the industry will continue to benefit from the metal demand generated from the country’s rebuilding activity. Sovereign debt issues and sluggish growth in Europe however remain lingering concerns.A Detailed Look into Metals
"
568,FCX,"Steel
"
569,FCX,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. But the recovery has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump.
"
570,FCX,"China continues to retain its status as the largest steel producing country, yielding almost half of the global output at 46%, and growing 8.9% year over year. Japan, the second largest producer country, however posted a 1.8% decline due to the earthquake.  The United States remained in the third position, producing 86.2 Mt of crude steel, 7.1% higher than 2010 and comprising 6% of the total global output.
"
571,FCX,"North America’s crude steel production was 118.9 Mt, an increase of 6.8% on 2010.  In Asia, overall growth was noted at 7.9% and Europe rose 4.6%. As per January figures, in the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 117 Mt, a 7.8% dip from January 2011 but flat with  December 2011 levels.
"
572,FCX,"Reflecting on the 2011 results of the steel companies in our coverage - ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) -- revenues increased across the board due to higher average steel prices and increase in shipments.
"
573,FCX,"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 91.9 million tons in fiscal 2011, representing 6% of the world's steel output. ArcelorMittal’s 2011 sales increased 10% to $94 billion and for AK Steel sales climbed 8% to $6.5 billion. Nucor recorded sales increase of 21% to reach $20 billion.
"
574,FCX,"In terms of profitability, Nucor stood tall with its fiscal 2011 EPS of $2.45, almost six fold the 42 cents earned in 2010. ArcelorMittal’s EPS in fiscal 2011 plummeted 31% to $1.19. AK Steel reversed its year-ago loss to earn 9 cents (excluding special items) in 2011. U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report), though still in red, narrowed its fiscal 2011 loss per share to 47 cents from the year-ago loss of $3.36.
"
575,FCX,"Currently, Nucor, United Steel and AK Steel retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term (1 to 3 months) that corresponds with our Neutral recommendations in the long term. ArcelorMittal retains a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and we have recently downgraded our long-term recommendation from Neutral to Underperform.
"
576,FCX,"The steel industry had been severely affected by the global economic crisis. However, there were signs of a turnaround from the second half of 2009 which continued into 2010 and 2011 at tandem with global economic activity. Demand for steel products nonetheless remains below pre-recession levels. We expect the recovery to be slow and steady in 2012.
"
577,FCX,"The steel companies expect volumes to improve in 2012 on recovering demand from improving end-markets, backed by a recuperating global economy. They expect operating results to significantly improve from 2011 levels mainly driven by improved average realized prices and higher shipments. Steel consumption is expected to grow in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial, and the agricultural sectors.
"
578,FCX,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector is showing significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached the highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first two months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.6 million SAAR, outperforming the Street expectations.
"
579,FCX,"The construction sector has been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, we see some early signs of recovery in non-residential construction.
"
580,FCX,"According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to twelve month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 50.9 in January 2012. The index has remained over 50 for the third consecutive month, a sure indicator of an overall rise in demand.
"
581,FCX,"The optimism is seen across most regions of the country and the major construction sectors. However, given the continued uncertainty in the market, we expect soft to very moderate near-term growth in demand in this sector.
"
582,FCX,"According to the data released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts increased 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 in January 2012 from December 2011 and 9.9% above January 2011.
"
583,FCX,"Building permits in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000, 0.7% above the December figure of 671,000 and 19% above the January 2011 number. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally on a road to recovery.
"
584,FCX,"Based on expected economic growth from developing countries like China, India and South Korea, steel prices will be pushed up higher in the future. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the steel industry.
"
585,FCX,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal has idled 5 of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred.Gold
"
586,FCX,"As per the World Gold Council reports, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
587,FCX,"Mine production increased 4% year over year to a record level of 2809.5 tons. However, there was a decline noted in recycling activity as consumers held on to their gold in the expectation of even higher prices. Central banks purchases rose significantly to 440 tons from 77 tons in the prior year reflecting the need to diversify assets, reduce reliance on one or two foreign currencies and rebalance reserves. Central banks have been net buyers for three straight years, the longest stretch since 1973.
"
588,FCX,"Demand for gold bars and coins were robust due to the concerns raging in Europe, inflation in some countries and the unsatisfactory performance of a range of alternative instruments. The ongoing crisis in Europe has positively affected the demand for gold given the need for asset protection.
"
589,FCX,"Jewelry demand was particularly strong in the first half of 2011 driven by the two major markets, China and India, due to the timing of local festivals. China and India remain the major consumers of gold, generating 55% of global jewelry demand and 49% of global demand. However, record prices in September combined with price volatility deviated customers towards other investment products.
"
590,FCX,"On the whole, a 28% increase in average annual price led to an annual decline of 3% in tonnage demand in fiscal 2011. Notwithstanding this, annual demand was a record $99.2 billion.
"
591,FCX,"Gold demand in the technology sector was at 463.5 tons worth $23.4 billion, a 28% increase year over year. Particular strength was noted in automotive electronics, industrial electronics and wireless equipment segments. However, the memory sector weakened considerably and is expected to remain so in 2012 as well. Severe flooding in Thailand which affected hard disk drive shipments, ongoing turmoil in Europe, and shift toward other non-precious metals also contributed to the weakness.
"
592,FCX,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. Average gold price was $1,572 per ounce in 2011 compared with the prior year average of $1,223 per ounce.  
"
593,FCX,"So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,598 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,698 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect his year to be stellar for the yellow metal.
"
594,FCX,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, pushed up gold prices.
"
595,FCX,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
596,FCX,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
597,FCX,"Ironically, rallying gold prices are not having the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold rather than investing in gold companies per se that are grappling with labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
598,FCX,"As the major economies continue to recover, investor confidence in the stock markets will be restored, causing gold prices to fall. In reality this is not going to happen anytime soon. The stocks of Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). However, Agnico Eagle holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell).Aluminum
"
599,FCX,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a drastically negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The sector has however recovered from recessionary lows.Alcoa Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, in response to the global economic downturn implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
600,FCX,"For fiscal 2011, Alcoa reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share, reversing the year-ago loss of 3 cents per share. The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up 7% and burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012.
"
601,FCX,"Aluminium demand started on a strong note in 2011 but weakened in the second half. Overall, aluminium demand grew 10% in the year after 13% growth witnessed in 2010. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
602,FCX,"Market conditions for aluminum products are expected to improve globally, particularly in aerospace (10–11%), driven by rising demand for large commercial aircraft. The strong performance at the automotive sector in the fourth quarter is expected to sustain in 2012, growing at en estimated clip of 3–5%. Commercial transportation is expected to grow 2–5%, packaging in the range of 2–3% and building and construction markets in the band of 4–5%.
"
603,FCX,"Region-wise, in 2012, China is expected to lead the pack with a growth of 12% followed shortly by India with a 10% rise. Asia (excluding China) is expected to record a growth of 9% and North America 3%. Russia and Brazil are expected to increase 4% and 3%, respectively. Europe, besieged by sovereign debt problems, is expected to remain flat year over year.
"
604,FCX,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have subsequently increased. In 2010, global aluminum prices rose 13%. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, aluminum prices plunged 27% from peak levels in April 2011. This was perpetrated by market concerns that the eurozone debt crisis could affect the global manufacturing industry and would lead to a huge downside in metals demand.
"
605,FCX,"Consequently, profits for the mining companies took a blow compelling them to cut back on production. Rio Tinto announced plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs.
"
606,FCX,"Alcoa plans to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in the first half of 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points and improve its competitiveness. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up actions to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
607,FCX,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with revival palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products.
"
608,FCX,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical aluminum.
"
609,FCX,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
610,FCX,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
611,FCX,"Currently, both Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
612,FCX,"Copper has become a major industrial metal given its properties of high ductility, malleability, and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, it ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
613,FCX,"Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the London Metal Exchange (LME), New York Mercantile Exchange (COMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Prices on these exchanges reflect the global balance of copper supply and demand, which can be volatile and cyclical.
"
614,FCX,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, combined with growing demand from China and other emerging economies, resulted in high copper prices and low levels of inventories.
"
615,FCX,"In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy. However, copper prices have since improved from the 2008 lows, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply.
"
616,FCX,"During the past three years, copper prices have fluctuated with LME spot copper prices ranging from $1.38 to $4.60 per pound. During 2011, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
617,FCX,"Not denying volatility in prices, which would always be there, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, long term. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
618,FCX,"The outlook for the copper business remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
619,FCX,"Freeport and Southern Copper retain a Zacks #3 Rank in agreement with our Neutral recommendation on the shares.

620,FCX,"Overview
"
621,FCX,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion's share of the output.
"
622,FCX,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products, such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
623,FCX,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores.
"
624,FCX,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM), Ford Motor Co. (F), Toyota Motor Corp (TM) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC) are large consumers of metals, especially steel and aluminum.Overall Outlook
"
625,FCX,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over-demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention to fewer mines.
"
626,FCX,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn, with a deal value almost half that of 2008. The focus of M&A activity shifted from being a driver of growth to that of defense, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
627,FCX,"In 2010, fairly unpredictable financial markets dictated metals prices, despite strong underlying fundamentals. In addition, several notable mining accidents have made mine safety a major factor for the industry and regulators. Despite the volatility, gold prices rose 400% over the past ten years and made a record run in 2010, increasing 26% and hitting a high of $1,432 an ounce.
"
628,FCX,"The year 2011 has been unstable for metals so far, with double-digit gold sell-offs and rallies during the first quarter. However, investors remain cautiously optimistic regarding the sector. Many analysts predict metal prices will end the year with double-digit growth considering demand is still outstripping supply.
"
629,FCX,"Unrest in the Middle East is also driving metal prices. On the down side, the end of the Fed's QE2 program and overall atmosphere of greater focus on fiscal restraint may limit significant gains.
"
630,FCX,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, and high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
631,FCX,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector's ability to influence the cost of inputs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
632,FCX,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region -- in particular China and India -- is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world's largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so.
"
633,FCX,"Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
634,FCX,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut in the aftermath of the country's earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country's reconstruction efforts.Detailed Look into Metals
"
635,FCX,"Steel
"
636,FCX,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 15% compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010. In September 2011, the world crude steel production was 124 mmt, an increase of 9.7% from September 2010.
"
637,FCX,"China's crude steel production in September 2011 was 56.7 mmt, up 16.5% from September 2010.
"
638,FCX,"Elsewhere in Asia, Japan produced 8.9 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, down 3.8% year over year. South Korea's crude steel production in September 2011 was 5.5 mmt, up 17.7% from September 2010.
"
639,FCX,"In the EU (European Union), Germany's crude steel production in September 2011 was 3.7 mmt, up 10.3% from September 2010. Italy produced 2.6 mmt of crude steel, up 11.5%. France produced 1.3 mmt of crude steel, up 4.2%.
"
640,FCX,"Turkey produced 3.0 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, 16.9% higher than September 2010.
"
641,FCX,"The US produced 7.2 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, up 8.9% from September 2010.
"
642,FCX,"Brazilian crude steel production for September 2011 was 2.8 mmt, 3.8% higher than September 2010.
"
643,FCX,"The World Steel Association provided its Short Range Outlook (SRO) for 2011 and 2012. World Steel forecasts that apparent steel use will increase by 6.5% to 1,398 mmt in 2011, following a growth rate of 15.1% in 2010. In 2012, it is forecast that world steel demand will grow further by 5.4%.
"
644,FCX,"China's apparent steel use in 2011 is expected to increase by 7.5% to 643.2 mmt following an 8.5% growth rate in 2010. In 2012, steel demand is expected to maintain a 6.0% growth rate, which will bring China's apparent steel use to 681.6 mmt.
"
645,FCX,"In 2011, India's steel use is forecast to grow by 4.3% to reach 67.7 mmt. In 2012, the growth rate is forecast to accelerate to 7.9%.
"
646,FCX,"Apparent steel use in the US is forecast to rebound strongly by 11.6% in 2011. In 2012, steel use in the US is expected to grow by 5.2% to 93.8 mmt, bringing it back to 87% of the 2007 level. For NAFTA as a whole, apparent steel use will grow by 9.0% and 4.9% in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
"
647,FCX,"In Central and South America, apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 4.7 % in 2011 to reach a historical high of 47.8 mmt. In 2012, the region's apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 9.8% to reach 52.4 mmt, almost 28% higher than the 2007 level.
"
648,FCX,"European countries continued to show divergent recovery paths in 2011. While steel demand in Germany and Poland are expected to grow at impressive rates, steel demand in Spain, by contrast, is expected to record a sluggish 1.7% recovery.
"
649,FCX,"Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is projected to increase by 7.0% in 2011 to 155.0 mmt. In 2012, the growth of steel demand is expected to stall in most of the European countries with the notable exception of Poland which is forecast to post an impressive 9.5% growth. Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is forecast to grow by 2.5% to around 158.9 mmt in 2012, bringing it back to only 80% of the 2007 peak.
"
650,FCX,"Japan's steel use is expected to decline by 2.7% to 61.8 mmt in 2011 due mainly to the disruptions caused by the earthquake. In 2012 apparent steel use in Japan is forecast to show a growth of 0.8% to reach 62.3 mmt, 77% of the 2007 level.
"
651,FCX,"In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, consisting of Russia and 10 other former Soviet Union republics), apparent steel use is forecast to grow by a strong 14.4% in 2011 and then by 7.5% in 2012. These projections will bring the region's apparent steel use in 2012 to almost 60 mmt, a new high for the region.
"
652,FCX,"Steel demand in Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region is expected to fall by 0.9% in 2011, mainly due to downward revisions from North African countries. However, boosted by high oil prices, steel use in the region is forecast to resume growth in 2012 at a rate of 8.7%. Given that the political situation in the region is far from settled, considerable uncertainties hold out a threat to the current forecasts for this region.
"
653,FCX,"In the third quarter 2011, sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world's largest steel-producing company, increased 22.6% year over year to $24.2 billion from $19.7 billion in the year-ago quarter but decreased 3.6% sequentially from $25.1 billion. Sales were down sequentially primarily due to lower average steel selling prices (-1.7%) and lower volume of shipments (-4.9%). Total steel shipments in the third quarter of 2011 were 21.1 million metric tons compared with 20.5 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
654,FCX,"Similarly, sales for U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) improved 13% year over year to $5.1 billion from $4.5 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.1 billion. Shipments totaled 5.5 million tons, and were down by 0.8% year over year.Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) sales surged 27% year over year to $5.25 billion beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.86 billion. The growth was attributable to an increase of 24% in average price per ton and a rise of 3% in shipments (to 5.8 million tons) to outside customers. Steel mill shipments grew 9% to 4.2 million tons during the quarter.
"
655,FCX,"Currently, Nucor has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #5 Rank (Strong Sell). We maintain our Outperform recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, while we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on Nucor.Gold
"
656,FCX,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, reflecting recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of the end of December.
"
657,FCX,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,432 per ounce. Gold's performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
658,FCX,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
659,FCX,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
660,FCX,"Global gold demand in the second quarter of 2011 totaled 919.8 tons, down 17% from the remarkably strong levels of 1,107 tons in the second quarter of 2010. Gold demand in value terms grew by 5% year-on-year reaching $44.5 billion up from $42.6 billion in the second quarter of 2010. This is the second highest quarterly value on record, only fractionally below the $44.7 billion record that occurred in the fourth quarter in 2010.
"
661,FCX,"The quarterly average gold price rose by 26%, reaching a record high of $1,506.13 (as per the London PM fix).
"
662,FCX,"Second quarter 2011 global investment demand was 359.4 tons, 37% down year-on-year from 574.2 tons in the second quarter in 2010, which was the second highest quarter ever.
"
663,FCX,"Demand for gold bars and coins totaled 307.7 tons during the second quarter of 2011, a gain of 9% over year-earlier levels of 282.6 tons. In value terms, bar and coin demand was worth $14.9 billion, an increase of 37% from $10.9 billion in the second quarter of 2010.
"
664,FCX,"Jewelry demand in the second quarter of 2011 was 442.5 tons, 6% higher than the year-earlier levels of 416.7 tons. In value terms, this represented a 34% increase to $21.4 billion from $16.0 billion in the same quarter last year. India, China and Turkey together accounted for 59% of global jewelry demand at 260.1 tons in the second quarter of 2011 and registered a combined growth of 36.1 tons on year-earlier levels.
"
665,FCX,"Gold supply was 1,058.7 tons in the second quarter of 2011, which was a 4% decline from 1,108.3 tons in the same period in 2010, as a result of an increase in net purchasing by central banks. Mine production rose by 7% to 708.8 tons from year-earlier levels of 659.4 tons in 2010.
"
666,FCX,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
667,FCX,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45-50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. As China and India continue to grow
"
668,FCX,"rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
669,FCX,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
670,FCX,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral views on the stocks. As major economies continue to recover, investors' confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) on Barrick Gold, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation and a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Agnico-Eagle and Newmont Mining.Aluminum
"
671,FCX,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, relating to prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has, however, recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA) is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum. In response to the global economic downturn, the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
672,FCX,"In 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa's aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 200 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are sure to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
673,FCX,"On September 15, 2011, Alcoa announced it will expand its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant to meet rising demand from the automotive market. More and more automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are switching from steel to aluminum as they seek to increase the fuel efficiency, safety, durability and performance of the cars they produce.
"
674,FCX,"The expansion will entail an investment of approximately $300 million. The growth project will create an additional 150 full time jobs in Davenport once completed, bringing total employment to more than 2,300 high-value jobs. In addition, during construction, an incremental 150 jobs will be created at the plant. The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2013.
"
675,FCX,"Alcoa is expected to benefit from the improving outlook of aluminum and alumina prices. Alcoa continues to project that aluminum demand will grow 12% in 2011 versus 13% growth in 2010, well ahead of the 6.5% compound annual growth rate needed to double aluminum demand by 2020.
"
676,FCX,"Increasing demand in China, where the company has raised its 2011 growth projection two-percentage points to 17%, will mostly offset declines in Europe and other regions. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
677,FCX,"Both these factors are positives for underlying aluminum demand. We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices.
"
678,FCX,"We are also optimistic about Alcoa's long-term growth projects in China, Australia, Jamaica, Suriname and Brazil. Demand from these countries is expected to increase its alumina and aluminum production capacity while lowering its operating costs. The company recently expanded its Alumar Refinery, north of Brazil, and doubled its annual capacity from 1.5 million tons to 3.6 million tons of alumina. Recently, Alcoa started production at its Aviles smelter in Spain under the Primary Metal segment. We expect such expansions to drive Alcoa's top line.
"
679,FCX,"Alcoa reported adjusted earnings per share of 15 cents per share in the third quarter 2011, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents per share. Adjusted earnings more than doubled from 6 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter, but were 46.4% lower from the sequential quarter earnings of 28 cents per share due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe.
"
680,FCX,"Revenues for the quarter were up 21% year over year to $6.419 billion, and were down from $6.585 billion in the sequential quarter. Alcoa's end-markets demonstrated strong revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis whereas sequentially they experienced mixed market conditions. Revenue was lower for both alumina and aluminum, down 5% and 1%, respectively, driven by lower alumina shipments and lower realized pricing in both businesses.
"
681,FCX,"In the end-markets, revenue increased in commercial transportation (6%) and aerospace (2%), while declines were seen in automotive (7%), industrial products (6%), building and construction (5%), and packaging (4%).
"
682,FCX,"Since the sudden decline from the peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco  swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
683,FCX,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
684,FCX,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is pushing manufacturers to switch to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers for example, are now shifting toward aluminum, which is more economical.
"
685,FCX,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG  -  Free Report) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
686,FCX,"Currently, Alcoa holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) supported by our long-term Underperform recommendation, while Paramount Gold and Silver has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).Copper
"
687,FCX,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend since 2010 benefiting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand has since been witnessing growth.
"
688,FCX,"The Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
689,FCX,"Even though copper prices are close to their all-time highs, the outlook for copper prices remains favorable. Not denying the volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, in the long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute.
"
690,FCX,"Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. The companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
691,FCX,"We currently have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on Freeport and a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) on Southern Copper.

693,FCX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Freeport-McMoran, Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Freeport-McMoran is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FCX in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FCX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.83% heading into earnings season.Freeport-McMoran, Inc.

(FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jan 25.In the last quarter, the mining company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.2% by posting adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents.Revenues went up around 11.2% year over year to $4,310 million in the third quarter, also topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,104.1 million.Freeport missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while beating once, with an average negative surprise of 7.9%.Shares of Freeport have moved up 31% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 15.5% gain.  Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Freeport for the fourth quarter is +2.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 50 cents and 49 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayFreeport, during third-quarter earnings call, stated that the company expects sales volumes for 2017 to be roughly 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces of gold and 94 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 625,000 ounces of gold and 23 million pounds of molybdenum for fourth-quarter 2017.The company assumes average prices of $3.00 per pound of copper and $1,300 per ounce of gold for fourth-quarter 2017. Average realized prices for copper and gold were $2.94 per pound and $1,290 per ounce, respectively, in the third quarter. The company gained from higher copper prices in the third quarter which is expected to continue in the December quarter.Meanwhile, consolidated copper production for the fourth quarter is expected to rise 2.1% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter stands at 1,017 million pounds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter is $4.8 billion, reflecting a year over year increase of around 9.7%.Copper sales from Freeport’s North American Copper Mines for the fourth quarter is projected to suffer a 4.5% decrease from the third as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 358 million pounds. The segment’s sales volume decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades and timing of shipments.  Gold sales from the Indonesia Mining for the fourth quarter is projected to increase by 47.3% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 607,000 ounces. Copper sales from Indonesia Mining are expected to rise 16.7% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is 342 million pounds.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for copper sales from the company’s South America Mining is expected to be 315 million pounds for the fourth quarter, reflecting an estimated 4% decline on a sequential-comparison basis.  Freeport is taking actions to cut mining costs and manage capital expenditures. For 2017, Freeport’s copper cost guidance of $1.19 per pound reflects a decline in consolidated unit net cash costs from 2016 level of $1.26 per pound.Consolidated average unit net cash costs for copper is also expected to decline 19.8% sequentially in the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 97 cents per pound.

695,FCX,"Picking stocks from the vast investment universe is not an easy task. For this, one has to understand the fundamentals of every company and try to place them against the current economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment.One way to accomplish this task is to follow broker recommendation. Brokers have more insight into what’s happening in a particular company as they directly communicate with management. Also, they have deeper understanding of the overall industry.Specifically, brokers research on a company’s publicly available financial statements, listen to conference calls and engage in talks directly with the top management. At times, they even talk with customers to gauge what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company.So, it is only after thorough research that brokers decide to rate a particular company’s stock. Naturally, when an analyst upgrades a stock, one can easily rely on it.However, solely depending on analysts’ upgrades is not the right way to build investment portfolio. One should also take into consideration other factors to ensure solid returns.Choosing the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (4 weeks) of 1% or more: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must be trading above $5.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank equal to #1 or #2: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have a proven record of success.

698,FCX,"The powerful stock market reversal and rally that began last week doesn't appear tired yet. Last Wednesday, I wrote about the strength of the reversal and why I was going long through leveraged ETFs like UPRO and TNA, targeting S&P 1,200 at the minimum.  
"
699,FCX,"And I also recapped a theme about which catalyst matters more: European debt woes or US economic fundamentals. I proposed that Europe's daily headline knee-jerk would begin to matter less than earnings and leading indicators.  
"
700,FCX,"Today's price action might lead one to say, ""Hey Kevin, you've got this one completely wrong!"" But let's look at what's going on here. The headlines say that the leaders of Germany and France, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, had a little summit over the weekend and emerged with fresh proposals and confidence to stem the crisis. The Daily European Head-Fake 
"
701,FCX,"Did we get specific plans and agreements about Eurozone financial crisis remedies? Nope. We got verbal commitments about recapitalizing banks before the end of the month and the next G-20 summit.  
"
702,FCX,"That bodes for a 3% rally in US equities? I don't think so. I think money managers are continuing the same theme as last week -- and the last few months, for that matter -- that the ""probable recession"" has been well-discounted and the economy and earnings may fare much better than most were expecting.  
"
703,FCX,"Since a mild recession was nearly priced-in, what happens to valuations when earnings projections don't fall as much as expected and stocks are on sale? They get really juicy to fund managers, that's what.  The Slow-Growth Overreaction 
"
704,FCX,"Yes, the bailout of Belgian bank Dexia was a boost to confidence showing that European financial leaders can actually take action during crisis. I have been saying since mid-August that Europe's implosion (i.e., a systemic banking crisis) would be the tipping point that sent the US into recession. But I guess I have always believed they would do what was necessary, even though they appear to be taking their sweet time.  
"
705,FCX,"And, yes, US corporate earnings estimates can still fall below $90 EPS on the S&P 500 this year. But those earnings still put a 13 times P/E multiple on the broad market at an index level of 1,200.  
"
706,FCX,"This morning, Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, offered this evidence of the much-brighter outlook for the US: In an absolute sense, all recent economic readings have been soft and weak. But relative to fears of a recession, they are pointing towards a non-recessionary outlook. Bottom line: the U.S. economy remains weak, but it does not appear to be double dipping.  
"
707,FCX,"Some early evidence of this non-recessionary tone of recent economic reports has started showing up in estimates for third quarter GDP growth rates. On Friday, Macroeconomic Advisors raised their estimate for third quarter GDP growth from 2% to 2.5%, citing the positive economic reports, particularly the construction data, retail sales and payrolls data. I would expect this trend in positive estimate revisions to gain pace in the coming days.
"
708,FCX,"I would add to this that the stage is also set for very positive reactions to earnings and guidance. Not that official expectations are so low, but that mental ones are. Analysts and portfolio managers are ""wary of the warnings."" 
"
709,FCX,"If we don't get them, and we continue to hear ""steady as she goes"" language from CEOs like we got last week from corporate heads at FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), and ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) at a summit in Colombus, Ohio, then stocks will sustain their current forward estimates. The View from the Chart 
"
710,FCX,"The one piece of evidence that still makes me doubt we'll see S&P 1,300 again this year is the chart. Yes, everyone will be cheerleading the fact we made it back through the 50-day moving average, currently sloping down at 1,175.  
"
711,FCX,"But I predicted this back in early August as just a natural part of bear market rallies. Now we haven't ""officially"" entered a bear market since the index barely closed 20% off the peak (19.7% by my rough calculation using 1,370 and 1,100).  
"
712,FCX,"Still, the chart doesn't look exactly bullish. It looks like a lot of sideways bull vs. bear energy needs to be exhausted before we can recover the 200-day moving average. That battle and its data digestion could take another four to six months.  
"
713,FCX,"And that's with no recession. Just slow growth, especially as China engineers a soft landing. As always, the best investing and trading opportunities will be in playing earnings and technical momentum in quality companies.  
"
714,FCX,"Even though energy, materials, and industrials are the most sensitive to the global slowdown, catching the swings in names like CVR Energy , Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), Potash (POT), and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) has paid off recently. These all will likely test their lows again before long and offer another opportunity.

Growing earnings firms outpaced declining earnings by 3.16 ratio, revenues 5.16 growth ratio.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 46.3% in 2010, expected to rise 14.2% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 13.4%. Financials major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding financials growth was 28.1% in 2010, and expected to be 17.7% in 2011 and 10.2% in 2012.  Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 7.73% in 2010, expected to be up 6.78% in 2011, and 6.12% in 2012. Excluding financials, revenues up 9.10% in 2010, expected to rise 12.10% in 2011 and 4.84% in 2012.Annual net margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.36% in 2009 to 8.64% for 2010, 9.13% expected for 2011 and 9.87% in 2012. Margin expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.03% in 2009, 8.26% for 2010, 8.67% expected in 2011, and 9.11% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 0.46 for 2011, at 0.30 for 2012 (both very bearish).

Total revisions activity past lows.S&P 500 earned $543.6 billion in 2009, rising to $795.1 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $907.7 billion in 2011.

Puts P/Es at 13.89x for 2010, and 12.24x for 2011 and 10.80x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 1.99%. Top-down estimates -- $96.66 for 2011 and $105.34 for 2012.What to Expect from 3Q Earnings
"
716,FCX,"Attention now shifts to third quarter earnings season. We just have 28, or 5.6%, of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far, so it is way too early draw any firm conclusions.
"
717,FCX,"We will need another season where positive earnings surprises far outpace disappointments if we are going to match the second quarter growth rate. On the top line, growth is expected to slow sharply, to 6.31% in total from 11.01% in the second quarter, and excluding the financials to 10.04% from 13.25%.
"
718,FCX,"In light of the generally downbeat economic news overall, it is not surprising that we are not seeing a lot of estimate increases without the catalyst of positive earnings surprises. The strong earnings performances we have seen -- particularly in large multinational company earnings -- are the single most important argument in the bulls' favor (along with the low valuations based on those earnings). Thus if that starts to crack in a big way, it is a very big concern.
"
719,FCX,"Against the poor macro backdrop one has to look at the valuations that stocks are currently have. Those to me look wildly attractive, particularly if the current earnings expectations (or anything close to them) can be achieved.
"
720,FCX,"If it turns out that we avoid an outright recession, and the decline in profits that usually comes with one, then the market should rally from here. Expectations are starting to come down, particularly for 2012, but the vast majority of stocks, and every economic sector is expected to earn more in 2012 than in 2011.
"
721,FCX,"Those are not my forecasts, or even Zacks' forecasts. They are the collected wisdom of the individual analysts who cover the 500 individual stocks in the S&P 500. From my big picture point of view, it is hard to see how those forecasts don’t come down. However, there is still a fair amount of room to work with.
"
722,FCX,"The total earnings for the S&P 500 are currently expected to be 13.4% above 2011 levels next year. Some of that growth is due to the assumption of few write-offs at the banks. The timing of those can be hard to forecast, but I’m not sure it is a good assumption that the write-offs will fall dramatically.
"
723,FCX,"However, even excluding the Financial sector, 10.2% growth is now expected. We have started to see the estimates fall, but it has been happening at a very seasonally slow time for estimate revisions. Still, when you see more than three times as many estimate cuts than increases for next year, it is time to get a bit nervous.Recapping Key Data and Events of Last Week
"
724,FCX,"The economic news last week was mostly, but not entirely, on the upbeat side. Or to be more exact, it was better than expected, the absolute levels were mediocre at best.
"
725,FCX,"We got both of the ISM surveys, manufacturing and the non-manufacturing, or service, index. Both came in slightly better than expected and pointed to slow but positive growth. The manufacturing survey was at 51.6, up a full point from August when a slight decline was expected. The service index dropped to 53.0 from 53.3, a smaller-than-expected decline.
"
726,FCX,"Any reading over 50 indicates expansion. On the manufacturing side, though, the backlog of orders sub-index dropped sharply, and the new orders index was below 50, both of which are warning signs that things might be slowing in the near future.
"
727,FCX,"Initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 401,000. That was a rise of 6,000 for the week, but still slightly below the expected level. The significance was that it showed that the previous week’s massive decline was not a fluke.
"
728,FCX,"We really want to see the level decline well below the 400,000 level and stay there, but at least we are in the right zip code. That is s a positive sign that the jobs market might just be getting a bit better. Not quite “happy days are here again, but a very encouraging sign.
"
729,FCX,"Given the severity of the jobs crisis, it will take a long time (many years) to heal. Still, it is the level that would indicate that the economy is producing enough jobs on balance to start bringing down the unemployment rate. It comes too late to have much of an effect on the unemployment rate for September (the reference week is in the middle of the month), but if it can be sustained (a BIG ""if"") it could be signaling a lower unemployment rate in October.
"
730,FCX,"The big news of the week -- the one that everyone was focused on -- came on Friday. The jobs report showed that the total number of people employed rose by 103,000 in September. That is much better than consensus expectations for a gain of 60,000.
"
731,FCX,"This report was also better than the ADP report on Wednesday, which was also an upward surprise, but not a big enough one. That report showed 91,000 private sector jobs created, and the expectations were for the BLS to show 83,000 new private sector jobs. The “actual BLS number of private sector jobs was 137,000. Government payrolls declined by 34,000. The Federal government employment fell by 1,000 jobs. The State level added 2,000 but the Local levels laid off 35,000.
"
732,FCX,"The pace of government lay offs rose sharply from last month when a total of 15,000 government jobs were actually added (revised from a loss of 17,000). The unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey was also unchanged at 9.1%. That was in line with what the consensus was looking for.
"
733,FCX,"The household survey was noticeably more upbeat than the establishment survey, pointing to a gain of 398,000 jobs. The civilian participation rate rose to 64.2% from 64.0%, but is down from 64.7% a year ago.
"
734,FCX,"In other words, the unemployment rate was unchanged even though people were coming back into the labor force. This is the second month in a row that has happened, and it is a very encouraging sign. The percentage of people over the age of 16 who actually have jobs rose slightly to 58.3% from 58.2% (employment to population ratio, or the employment rate).
"
735,FCX,"However, July’s levels of both the participation rate and the employment rate were the lowest since 1983, so the small increases hardly mean that happy days are here again. While it was good news overall, there were some dark parts of it as well. Most notably the duration of unemployment figures.
"
736,FCX,"The number of people out of work for more than six months rose by 188,000. The average length of time an unemployed person has been looking for a job rose to a new record, 40.5 weeks. Half of all unemployed have been out of work for 22.2 weeks, up from 21.8 weeks in August. That is 6.242 million people, or 44.6% of all the unemployed.Falling Commodity Prices

737,FCX,"The recent weakness in the price of oil is an offset to the otherwise weak outlook going forward. That should help to offset some, but certainly not all, or close to all, of the current economic headwinds.
"
738,FCX,"In the Great Recession oil prices plunged from almost $150 per barrel to the low $30’s. That helped cushion the blow, but far from prevented the Great Recession from happening. The cliff that commodities fell off of last week makes it even clearer that inflation is not a big problem. If anything, deflation is a bigger risk right now (another reason for more monetary easing by the Fed).
"
739,FCX,"I found the decline in copper prices particularly alarming. While we got some rebound last week, rising by 5.8% on the week, the longer term decline is very troubling to me.
"
740,FCX,"Copper is sometimes referred to as the metal with a Ph.D. in economics. It is now just $3.28 per pound, off from a record high of $4.55 back in February. The good doctor is pretty much screaming about a coming economic slowdown, not just here, but around the world.
"
741,FCX,"It is important to note that the collapse in commodities prices took place very late in the quarter, and for the most part even now are still somewhat higher than they were a year ago. The commodity-driven sectors, Energy and Materials, are the ones that are expected to have the best year over year growth rates for the third quarter. I would not assume that the earnings growth for firms like Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) or Anadarko Petroleum (APC  -  Free Report) can come close to being repeated anytime soon.Cautiously Take Advantage of Valuations
"
742,FCX,"Long term investors should start to take advantage of the current valuations. However, I would not be shooting fro the stars. Look for those companies with solid dividends (say over 2.5%), low payout ratios, solid balance sheets, and a history of rising dividends, which are still seeing analysts raise their estimates for 2012, or are at least not cutting them aggressively. I don’t know if you will be happy doing so next week or even next month, but I am pretty sure that you will be quite satisfied five years from now if you do so.
"
743,FCX,"People tend to extrapolate the results of the previous decade or so when looking at what to expect from the stock market, and that is almost always a mistake. It led most people to be excessively bullish around 2000, and extremely bearish in the early 1980’s. The analysts who track the individual companies are still looking for solid growth in earnings next year, so unless we see the current trend towards cutting estimates continue or even accelerate, it is unlikely that the gap gets closed through falling earnings alone.
"
744,FCX,"It might well be a better case against investing in long-term government bonds than it is in making the case for investing in stocks. From the point of view of the long-term investor, this still looks like one of the best times to invest in my lifetime.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseJust 28 firms have reported third quarter results. Total growth at 10.52%. We have a 3.00 surprise ratio, and 3.00% median surprise, both around normal. Positive surprises for 64.3% of all firms reporting.Positive year-over-year growth for 15, falling EPS for 5 firms, 2.75 ratio, 73.9% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Sample size is extremely small and unrepresentative, all the numbers are likely to change significantly from week to week.Pay close attention to the % reported column in assessing the significance of sector level data.
"
745,FCX,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing about average on the ratio front. Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 3Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegFinance 148.84% 1.27% 29.67 1 0 1 0Industrial Products 13.11% 4.55% 10.64 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary 6.75% 9.68% 7.41 3 0 3 0Basic Materials 65.32% 8.70% 5.33 1 1 1 1Business Service 31.89% 10.53% 5.07 2 0 2 0Consumer Staples -3.74% 8.33% 3.23 2 1 2 1Computer and Tech -4.00% 6.94% 2.27 3 1 3 2Retail/Wholesale 6.47% 19.15% 1.22 5 3 7 2Construction -30.00% 9.09% 0.00 0 0 0 1Transportation 22.11% 11.11% -0.68 0 1 1 0Auto NA 0.00% NA NA NA NA NAConglomerates NA 0.00% NA NA NA NA NAAerospace NA 0.00% NA NA NA NA NAOils and Energy NA 0.00% NA NA NA NA NAUtilities NA 0.00% NA NA NA NA NAMedical NA 0.00% NA NA NA NA NAS&P 500 10.52% 5.60% 3.00 18 7 21 7Sales SurprisesStrong revenue growth of 11.22% among the 28 that have reported, median surprise 1.60 (strong), surprise ratio of 8.33.

748,FCX,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2011, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report.
"
749,FCX,"All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.                    
"
750,FCX,"The powerful stock market reversal and rally that began last week doesn't appear tired yet. Last Wednesday, I wrote about the strength of the reversal and why I was going long through leveraged ETFs like UPRO and TNA, targeting S&P 1,200 at the minimum.
"
751,FCX,"And I also recapped a theme about which catalyst matters more: European debt woes or US economic fundamentals. I proposed that Europe's daily headline knee-jerk would begin to matter less than earnings and leading indicators.
"
752,FCX,"Today's price action might lead one to say, ""Hey Kevin, you've got this one completely wrong!"" But let's look at what's going on here. The headlines say that the leaders of Germany and France, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, had a little summit over the weekend and emerged with fresh proposals and confidence to stem the crisis.
"
753,FCX,"The Daily European Head-Fake
"
754,FCX,"Did we get specific plans and agreements about Eurozone financial crisis remedies? Nope. We got verbal commitments about recapitalizing banks before the end of the month and the next G-20 summit.
"
755,FCX,"That bodes for a 3% rally in US equities? I don't think so. I think money managers are continuing the same theme as last week -- and the last few months, for that matter -- that the ""probable recession"" has been well-discounted and the economy and earnings may fare much better than most were expecting.
"
756,FCX,"Since a mild recession was nearly priced-in, what happens to valuations when earnings projections don't fall as much as expected and stocks are on sale? They get really juicy to fund managers, that's what.
"
757,FCX,"The Slow-Growth Overreaction
"
758,FCX,"Yes, the bailout of Belgian bank Dexia was a boost to confidence showing that European financial leaders can actually take action during crisis. I have been saying since mid-August that Europe's implosion (i.e., a systemic banking crisis) would be the tipping point that sent the US into recession. But I guess I have always believed they would do what was necessary, even though they appear to be taking their sweet time.
"
759,FCX,"And, yes, US corporate earnings estimates can still fall below $90 EPS on the S&P 500 this year. But those earnings still put a 13 times P/E multiple on the broad market at an index level of 1,200.
"
760,FCX,"This morning, Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, offered this evidence of the much-brighter outlook for the US:
"
761,FCX,"In an absolute sense, all recent economic readings have been soft and weak. But relative to fears of a recession, they are pointing towards a non-recessionary outlook. Bottom line: the U.S. economy remains weak, but it does not appear to be double dipping.    
"
762,FCX,"Some early evidence of this non-recessionary tone of recent economic reports has started showing up in estimates for third quarter GDP growth rates. On Friday, Macroeconomic Advisors raised their estimate for third quarter GDP growth from 2% to 2.5%, citing the positive economic reports, particularly the construction data, retail sales and payrolls data. I would expect this trend in positive estimate revisions to gain pace in the coming days.  
"
763,FCX,"I would add to this that the stage is also set for very positive reactions to earnings and guidance. Not that official expectations are so low, but that mental ones are. Analysts and portfolio managers are ""wary of the warnings.""
"
764,FCX,"If we don't get them, and we continue to hear ""steady as she goes"" language from CEOs like we got last week from corporate heads at FedEx (FDX), General Electric (GE), and ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) at a summit in Colombus, Ohio, then stocks will sustain their current forward estimates.
"
765,FCX,"The View from the Chart
"
766,FCX,"The one piece of evidence that still makes me doubt we'll see S&P 1,300 again this year is the chart. Yes, everyone will be cheerleading the fact we made it back through the 50-day moving average, currently sloping down at 1,175.
"
767,FCX,"But I predicted this back in early August as just a natural part of bear market rallies. Now we haven't ""officially"" entered a bear market since the index barely closed 20% off the peak (19.7% by my rough calculation using 1,370 and 1,100).
"
768,FCX,"Still, the chart doesn't look exactly bullish. It looks like a lot of sideways bull vs. bear energy needs to be exhausted before we can recover the 200-day moving average. That battle and its data digestion could take another four to six months. 
"
769,FCX,"And that's with no recession. Just slow growth, especially as China engineers a soft landing. As always, the best investing and trading opportunities will be in playing earnings and technical momentum in quality companies.
"
770,FCX,"Even though energy, materials, and industrials are the most sensitive to the global slowdown, catching the swings in names like CVR Energy (CVI), Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), Potash (POT), and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) has paid off recently. These all will likely test their lows again before long and offer another opportunity.

772,FCX,"Investors in Freeport-McMoRanInc. (FCX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 6, 2018 $18.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Freeport-McMoRan shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Freeport-McMoRan is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Mining - Non Ferrous industry that ranks in the Top 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 58 cents per shareto 57 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Freeport-McMoRan right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

773,FCX,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market, look no further than the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value ETF (JKI  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2004.The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $423.68 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueCompared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.46%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 18.30% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Freeport Mcmoran Inc (FCX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.26% of total assets, followed by Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.37% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJKI seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Value Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Value Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies.The ETF has added roughly 0.76% so far this year and was up about 9.43% in the last one year (as of 06/27/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $144.45 and $168.36.The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 14.03% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 192 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JKI is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs area of the market.

774,FCX,"Three cyclical sectors -- materials, industrials, and energy -- have lead the market higher during this recovery and their performance now is worth watching to see if the expansion is truly hitting stall speed or not.
"
775,FCX,"Below is a 2.5 year performance snapshot of the nine major market sectors as classified by McGraw-Hill's Select Sector SPDRs. 2011 data is through June 30, which is a good representation of the bull run when the S&P closed near 1,320.
"
776,FCX,"The data is expressed in percentages and the Equal Sector Strategy is a close match for the performance of the S&P 500 index itself, though the strategy has performed consistently better over almost all time periods. 
"
777,FCX,"As an aside, it is amazing to note the performance of Consumer Discretionary in this recovery. When the consumer was all but buried, at least figuratively, apparently she was out spending like crazy! I wrote about this in July in the article ""Consumer is Alive and Kicking.""Industry Focus Helps Stock Picking
"
778,FCX,"In the video that accompanies this article on the Zacks website, I show the following list of leading cyclical industries that currently top the rating system known as the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
779,FCX,"I also mention that two other cyclical industries made the top 50, Farm Machinery with names like Deere (DE  -  Free Report) and Oilfield Services with companies like Baker Hughes (BHI).
"
780,FCX,"Zacks Equity Research groups public companies into approximately 265 industries. The industries are then ranked based on the average of the Zacks Rank of their component stocks.
"
781,FCX,"In this way, all industries are classified based on the strength of the stocks within them. This means that an industry with more #1 and #2 Rank stocks than #4 and #5 Rank stocks will end up near the top of the heap.
"
782,FCX,"In the list above, the number in parentheses after the industry is the number of companies within it. This is important because as you can see from the number one industry, Mining, only two companies are represented, one of which is Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF  -  Free Report). And their Zacks Rank of #2 produces the highest Industry Rank.
"
783,FCX,"This means that an industry with more companies, like Oil Refining and Marketing with an #11 Industry Rank and 20 names, expresses more fundamental earnings strength because more stocks had to contribute to lift the group as a whole.
"
784,FCX,"Will Cyclicals Resume Leadership?
"
785,FCX,"Industry Rank can change often, just like individual stock Rank. But as a big-picture look at the economy and the potential for recession, I want to pay attention to how many cyclical industries are rising within, or falling out of, the top 50. 
"
786,FCX,"For more on using the Zacks Industry Rank, see this guide and video tour. I close with two quotes from the guide that crystallize the approach:
"
787,FCX,"Even the stock of a great company will languish if it is within an industry that is out of favor with investors. The key to investment success is finding great stocks in great industries.
"
788,FCX,"Here you will find industries with improving earnings prospects, which is the surest bait to lure investor interest. Once you have found the right industries, you can then drill down to find the best companies to add to your portfolio.

790,FCX,"Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. (EGC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal, per which privately held Dallas-based operator Cox Oil Offshore LLC will acquire the former. Apart from expanding Cox’s presence in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), the acquisition also offers Energy XXI the much-needed respite and best solution to maximize its shareholders’ value amid its distressing financials.   The move was hugely appreciated by the investors of Energy XXI, as evidenced by its share-price uptick post the announcement. The stock increased 19.36% to eventually close the session at $8.94 yesterday.Deal TermsPer the deal, Cox will buy all outstanding shares of Energy XXI for $9.10 a share, representing a 21% premium to Energy XXI’s closing share price as of Jun 15. The transaction is valued at $322 million.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approval, the deal is set for closure in the third quarter of this year.Energy XXI: A Victim of the Oil CrashEnergy XXI has had been going through quite a tumultuous phase since a couple of years, considering its bankruptcy filing and then successfully emerging out of it, along with a major shakeup in its leadership position.The company’s predecessor, Energy XXI Limited, one of the high flyers in the Gulf of Mexico, was touted as the largest producer in the Outer Continental Shelf, operating around 10 of the largest oilfields. The company, like many others during the oil boom, committed to growth through acquisitions and spent billions to bolster its footing in the U.S. offshore. In 2014, it snapped up Houston-based EPL Oil and Gas Inc. in a $2.3-billion deal, including the assumption of debt. Energy XXI was riding high with more than 750,000 net acres along with 16,000 square miles of 3D seismic data.However, things took a 360 degree turn for the company in 2015 as it was severely hit by the crude downturn. Aggravating the issue further was the infamous involvement of the company’s CEO John Schiller in money laundering. The company’s financials staggered severely as a result of all this and Energy XXI finally had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2016. It emerged from bankruptcy in late December 2016 and renamed itself as Energy XXI Gulf Coast Inc. A few months later, Schiller was ousted and the company announced major changes in its C-suite positions. Finally, Douglas E. Brooks took over as the CEO of the company in April 2017. A few months back, EPL’s CEO Gary Hanna was appointed as the chairman of the company.Though the restructuring agreement eliminated around $3.6 billion of debt, its financial struggle was still not over. In the last reported quarter, the company posted a net loss of $33.1 million. Energy XXI, grappling with cash-crunch woes, slashed various jobs last year and had been contemplating best-possible ways to seek collaboration and financial partner, as it could not grow without additional financing. It also appointed Morgan Stanley and Co LLC to evaluate its strategic plans to address liquidity challenges, future growth prospects and asset-retirement obligations among others.After exploring a wide range of options to boost the firm’s prospects, the company finally zeroed in on this $322-million deal, which will protect its shareholders’ value, offering them with a certain cash premium and less execution risk.Interestingly, the latest development comes a month after the company announced its decision to offload non-core assets worth $125 million to Orinoco Natural Resources LLC, which would have ended up acquiring 35% stake in Energy XXI. Of course, negotiations with Orinoco Natural have been terminated now, due to the more profitable proposition by Cox.What’s in it for Cox?Founded in 2004, Cox has been treading on growth trajectory through prudent acquisitions, and revitalization of mature oil and gas fields. Notably, it became the biggest Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) operator in 2016 with the acquisition of bulk of GoM assets from Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report). Cox further boosted its portfolio by acquiring more acreage from Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) that is set for closure by the third quarter of 2018.With operations stretching from Texas to Florida, Cox has holdings both in OCS and shallow waters off the coast of Louisiana. The assets include more than 200 operated wells in over 25 fields in GoM. With Energy XII’s key holdings located mainly in the OCS and GoM, its complementary asset base will bolster scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff.Importantly, the acquisition will more than double Cox’s Gulf of Mexico production, boosting output from 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) to 61,000 Boe/d.Zacks Rank and Another Stock to ConsiderHouston-based Energy XII currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc.

793,FCX,"Key Points:Done with second quarter earnings season, attention now shifts to the third quarter. Just 15 reports in. Total reported earnings growth of 13.9%. Ex-financials, growth is 8.2% year over year. Total revenue growth 8.97%, 8.95% ex-financials. Median earnings surprise 2.87% and median sales surprise 1.26%.For the vast majority (485) yet to report 10.0% growth expected, 12.0% ex-financials. Down from growth of 10.1%, 19.3% ex-financials growth in the second quarter.

Growing earnings firms outpaced declining earnings by 3.16 ratio, Revenues had a 5.16 growth ratio.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 46.1% in 2010, expected to rise 14.8% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 13.7%. Financials major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding financials, growth was 28.0% in 2010, and expected to be 18.3% in 2011 and 10.6% in 2012.  Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 7.88% in 2010, expected to be up 6.69% in 2011 and 5.89% in 2012. Excluding financials, revenues up 9.16% in 2010, expected to rise 11.36% in 2011 and 5.14% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.37% in 2009 to 8.63% for 2010, 9.22% expected for 2011 and 9.98% in 2012. Margin expansion a major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.04% in 2009, 8.25% for 2010, 8.76% expected in 2011, and 9.22% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 0.45 for 2011, at 0.35 for 2012 (both very bearish). Ratio of firms with rising-to-falling mean estimates at 0.55 for 2011, 0.42 (both also very bearish) for 2012. Total revisions activity near lows.S&P 500 earned $543.6 billion in 2009, rising to $794.1 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $911.9 billion in 2011.

Puts P/E’s at 13.57x for 2010, and 11.82x for 2011 and 10.39x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 1.83%. Top-down estimates, $96.16 for 2011 and $104.59 for 2012.The Earnings Picture
"
794,FCX,"The attention now shifts to third quarter earnings. We just  have 15, or 3.0% of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far, so it is way  too early draw any firm conclusions. The year-over-year growth rate for  the S&P 500 is 13.9%, way off the 27.9% pace those same 15 firms  posted in the second quarter.
"
795,FCX,"Of far more importance are the expectations for the 485 who have yet to  report. Growth for them is expected to slow just slightly, to 9.97% over  the third quarter of 2010, down from 10.09% year-over-year growth in  the second quarter. However, the second quarter was distorted by some  big hits to the financial sector.
"
796,FCX,"If we exclude the financials, growth in the third quarter is expected to  slow to 12.02% year over year from 19.31%. Then again, at the beginning  of earnings second quarter season, growth of 9.7% was expected, 12.2%  ex-Financials.
"
797,FCX,"We will need another season where positive earnings surprises far outpace disappointments if we are going to match the second-quarter  growth rate. On the top line, growth is also expected to slow sharply,  to 5.20% in total from 11.04% in the second quarter, and excluding the  financials to 8.95% from 13.21%.Net Margins Key to Growth
"
798,FCX,"Expanding net margins have been one of the keys to earnings growth. In  the second quarter, total net margins were 9.14%, and excluding  financials they were 9.13%, up from 9.10% and 7.95 ex-financials in the  second quarter of 2010 (all 500). In the third quarter the financials  net margins are expected to recover (we will see about that; it depends  on the level of net charge-offs at the banks, which are sort of hard to  predict). Thus, total net margins are expected (for the 485) to rise to  9.36%, while excluding financials they are expected to drop to 8.94%.
"
799,FCX,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.37% in 2009. They hit  8.63% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.22% in 2011 and  9.98% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the  recession, if the financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in  2008 to 7.04% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to  8.25% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.76% in 2011 and 9.22% in  2012.Full-Year Expectations
"
800,FCX,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net  income for 2010 rising to $794.1 billion in 2010, up from $543.4 billion  in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be  $911.9 billion, or increases of 46.1% and 14.8%, respectively. The  expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 trillion  mark to $1.037 trillion, for growth of 13.7%.
"
801,FCX,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per  share level for the first time at $108.72. That is up from $56.96 for  2009, $83.24 for 2010, and $95.56 for 2011. In an environment where the  10-year T-note is yielding 1.83%, a P/E of 13.6x based on 2010 and 11.8x  based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings  is just 10.4x.Estimate Revisions Near Seasonal Low
"
802,FCX,"Estimate revisions activity is near a seasonal low. What has really been  drying up is estimate increases, as those made immediately after the  second quarter positive earnings surprise roll off the four-week moving  total I track. The number of cuts has also declined, but not nearly as  sharply and as a result the ratio of increases to cuts is now at a very  bearish level of 0.45 for 2011 and just 0.35 for 2012.
"
803,FCX,"If those ratios stay in that area when total revision activity heats up  (as it will dramatically over the next month or so) it will be a reason  for very serious concern. The net cuts are very widespread, the ratio of  firms with rising mean estimates to falling is down to 0.55 for this  year and to 0.42 for next year, and every sector has more cuts than  increases for both this year and next.
"
804,FCX,"In light of the generally downbeat economic news, it is not surprising  that we are not seeing a lot of estimate increases without the catalyst  of positive earnings surprises. During slow revisions periods, the  revisions ratio is generally less significant that during periods of  high activity, but that does not mean that it should be ignored  completely, and it is flashing a yellow caution light pretty brightly  now.
"
805,FCX,"The strong earnings performance we have seen, particularly in large  multinational company earnings (like most of the S&P 500 I track in  this report) is the single most important argument in the bulls favor  (along with the low valuations based on those earnings). Thus if that  starts to crack in a big way, it is a very big concern.Recap of Key Data and Events of Last Week
"
806,FCX,"The economic news this week was mostly, but not entirely, on the  downbeat side. Housing Starts were down by 5.0% for the month and 5.8%  from a year ago. They have been more or less moving sideways at  extremely depressed levels (down apx. 75% from peak) for well over two  years now. Thus the weakness was not exactly shocking, but it was not  very encouraging either.
"
807,FCX,"On the plus side, the lack of new building means that we are not adding  much to inventory. Of course, that does not help out the employment  situation much. Looking forward, there was a 3.2% increase in building  permits. No real reason for celebration there, but it offsets the  weakness in starts.
"
808,FCX,"Used home sales were better than expected, posting a 7.7% rise on the  month and up 18.6% from a year ago. The year-ago number was depressed  from the end of the homebuilder tax credit, so I would not be  extrapolating that year-over-year gain.
"
809,FCX,"Inventories dropped by 3.0% on the month, causing the months supply to  fall to 8.5 from 9.5. Still too high but moving in the right direction.  On the commercial real estate front the Architects billing index turned  slightly positive after being negative for five months -- a small  positive sign for 2012.  
"
810,FCX,"Initial Claims for jobless benefits fell to 423,000. Again -- lousy  level, but right direction. We really need to see that number fall below  the 400,000 level to indicate the job market is returning to health.  Given the severity of the jobs crisis, it will take some time to heal,  even after we get below that level. That is the level that would  indicate that the economy is producing enough jobs on balance to start  to bring down the unemployment rate. Not there yet.
"
811,FCX,"Looking at just the U.S. data for the week, and with very few earnings  reports out (and those on balance positive) you would have thought we  would have sort of a flat week for the market. Instead, we had the worst  one since late 2008. However, it is not just the U.S. economy that  affects the market. We got some weak numbers out of both Europe and  China as well, and that helped throw the market for a loop.
"
812,FCX,"The Greek saga continued with alternating news about if they would get  the next installment of their aid package. I think they will get this  one, but the one after that will be a bigger hurdle. I still think the  question is when -- not if -- Greece defaults. And the question is days  or weeks, not quarters or years.Twist and Shout
"
813,FCX,"The big news of the week was the Fed coming out with “Operation Twist.""  It will sell $400 billion of short-term t-bills and notes and buy an  equivalent amount of longer-term paper. This is sort of like the Kim  Kardashian of monetary policy actions -- it is unexplainably popular,  does not do much and is all about the back end.
"
814,FCX,"At the margin it could lower long-term interest rates a little bit,  possibly at the expense of higher short-term rates, but given the pledge  to keep very short rates under 0.25% through 2013, there will probably  be very little effect (even less than on the long end) on short rates.  The downside of this is that it flattens the yield curve, which hurts  bank net interest margins.
"
815,FCX,"It is not like the real problem in the economy is that interest rates  anywhere on the yield curve are too high. Even the 30-year T-bond is  yielding only 2.90%, and the 10-year is at 1.83%. Right off the bat it  looks like the policy has been very successful in bringing down  long-term rates, as long-term treasuries tumbled to even lower historic  lows.
"
816,FCX,"So what will bringing them down by another handful of basis points accomplish? Next to nothing.
"
817,FCX,"Just about every market other than the long-end of the bond market did  not take kindly the action. I don’t think that it is particularly  harmful, just impotent. I suspect this tacit admission of impotence by  the Fed is the real reason the market was so weak after the  announcement. The other implication is that the bond market is shouting  that inflation is not a problem and that the government is not crowding  out private investment.
"
818,FCX,"The Fed also moved from saying that the downside risks to the economy  are increasing to saying that there are significant downside risks to  the economy. In other news, the sun rose in the east today. Many  commentators pointed to that statement as the reason for the weakness,  but I didn’t think it revealed anything that anyone taking even a  cursory glance at the economic numbers has was not already thinking.What the Fed Could Have Done/Might Still Do
"
819,FCX,"I was, however, disappointed that the Fed did not take a step that I  think would have an impact, and which would actually save the government  some money. It should have stopped paying interest on excess reserves.  In effect the Fed is now paying banks not to lend, which is the exact  opposite of what we need them to do. OK, its not that much -- just 0.25%  -- but on about $1.7 billion of excess reserves, it adds up to almost  $4 billion.
"
820,FCX,"There are two additional options that the Fed has left. One would be to  embark on QE3, which would effectively be doing half of Operation Twist  -- just the buying part. However, if the Fed did that they would  effectively be telling the GOP establishment to go jump in a lake. In  light of the explicit warnings not to go down that path, if Chairman  Bernanke were to so, the Fed would be painted as being a tool of the  Obama administration.
"
821,FCX,"The other step the Fed could take would to be to explicitly target a  higher inflation rate. That is a step that would run directly against  the grain of any Central Banker. However, if people credibly believed  that inflation would be running at, say, 4% for the next five years or  so, then the last thing businesses would want to be holding would be  cash. Such a step, though, is fraught with the potential for unexpected  consequences, and I seriously doubt they will go down that path.Empty Toolbox
"
822,FCX,"With the Fed now seen as out of ammo, and fiscal policy off the table  due to political gridlock (and headed on the wrong path towards  austerity) the government is not able to do anything to head off a  potential double dip recession. The economy remains extremely fragile  and susceptible to outside shocks. The turmoil in Europe -- the  destination for about 25% of our exports -- has plenty of potential to  be just such a shock.
"
823,FCX,"Passing the American Jobs Act (AJA) would be extremely helpful in  heading off a renewed recession, but given the political dynamics right  now, that is just not going to happen. If it (or something like it) does  not pass, then not only will the economy not get any additional  stimulus, but fiscal policy will be leaning heavily towards actively  slowing the economy.
"
824,FCX,"The biggest feature of the AJA is an expansion of the payroll tax cut.  It would increase the size of the payroll tax cut from 2% of the first  $106,800 someone earns to 3% on the individual side, and also introduce  cuts in the payroll tax on the employer side, particularly targeted at  small businesses. For the median household (including households of one)  that would mean about $500 more in after tax income than in 2011.
"
825,FCX,"In contrast, if nothing is done, the 2011 payroll tax cut will expire,  and the median household will have $1,000 less to spend. That will be a  huge hit to consumer demand (about 70% of the economy) and would result  in even more unemployment. While small businesses and their owners are  often referred to as the ""job creators,"" that is not really the case.
"
826,FCX,"Yes, historically most new paychecks have been signed by the owners of  small businesses. However, no business, large of small, is going to hire  people if they don’t think that there are customers for their goods or  services. It is customers who are the job creators, not businesses,  large or small. It is uncertainty about the number of customers, not  about taxes or regulations, which are keeping businesses from hiring.
"
827,FCX,"In 2010, real median income dropped 2.3% from 2009 levels and is now  6.4% below where it was at the start of the Great Recession and 7.1%  below its 1999 peak. We also learned that the poverty rate rose to 15.1%  in 2010 from 14.3% in 2009, and from 12.5% in 2007 before the start of  the Great Recession. People in poverty do not make great customers, and  thus are not very good job creators. For more on the poverty report, see this article.  A Lot Resting on Congress
"
828,FCX,"The thrust of the “American Jobs Act runs directly counter to the  thrust of the debt-ceiling deal. The “Super Committee of six Democrats  and six Republicans that is charged with coming up with $1.5 Trillion in  deficit reduction over the next decade is on the road to failure.
"
829,FCX,"If they cannot come up with an agreement by November 23rd, or if  Congress does not pass the package by December 23rd, then automatic  spending cuts of $1.2 Trillion kick in. Half of those would be to  defense, and half to non-defense (mostly discretionary) spending. That  is a meat-cleaver approach and will be front-end loaded, with big cuts  starting in 2013.
"
830,FCX,"It is clear to me that the Super Committee is going to be deadlocked  and/or whatever they come up with will not pass Congress or be signed by  President Obama. Thus, the market has to start to price in some of  those meat-cleaver cuts.
"
831,FCX,"The other possibility would be that the next Congress decides to cancel  the whole thing. That would require a very large shift in Congress in  the 2012 elections, and that Congress would not take office until  January of 2013, which would be cutting things very close. Any repeal of  debt-ceiling deal -- now law -- would be subject to filibuster, and as  such would require 60 votes in the Senate. The odds of that happening  are extremely low.Focusing on the Wrong Deficit
"
832,FCX,"Policy makers remain far too focused on the wrong deficit. The trade  deficit is a big part of what is ailing the economy. Right now the  budget deficit is not (it could well be a problem down the road, but it  is not causing big problems now. If it were, the government would not be  able to borrow for 30 years at just 2.90%).
"
833,FCX,"Bringing down the trade deficit will require a weaker dollar, but last  week, the dollar was just about the only thing that went up in price,  along with T-notes. (An energy policy aimed at moving towards using  domestic Natural Gas as a transportation fuel replacing imported oil  would also go a very long way towards brining down the trade deficit, ad  getting the economy moving again.)
"
834,FCX,"Currency values are always relative, and a weak Dollar requires a strong  Euro, the second-most important currency in the world (with a huge gap  between it and number three, which would either be the Yen or the  Pound). The current mess in Europe is not conducive to a strong Euro.
"
835,FCX,"The end result was an extremely weak market last week, the worst one we  have had since the 2008 crisis was in full bloom. Against the very poor  macro-backdrop, one has to look at the valuations that stocks are  currently have. Those to me look wildly attractive, particularly if the  current earnings expectations (or anything close to them) can be  achieved.
"
836,FCX,"Market Pricing in a New Recession?
"
837,FCX,"At these levels, it is clear to me that the market is pricing in not  just slower growth, but an outright recession -- either underway or just  about to get underway. If it turns out that we avoid an outright  recession, and the decline in profits that usually comes with one, then  the market should rally from here.
"
838,FCX,"As I noted above, the expectations are starting to come down,  particularly for 2012, but the vast majority of stocks, and every  economic sector is expected to earn more in 2012 than in 2011. The  decline in the revisions ratio is mostly driven right now by the drying  up of new estimate increases, rather than a flood of new estimate cuts.  It is entirely normal at this point seasonally for overall revisions  activity to slow down dramatically.
"
839,FCX,"Not only were stocks down hard, commodities got hit even harder --  including gold and silver. More importantly, oil prices fell sharply,  which acts as a tax cut for the developed world (not just the U.S. but  also Europe and Japan as well). That should help to offset some, but  certainly not even close to all, of the current economic headwinds.
"
840,FCX,"In the Great Recession oil prices plunged from almost $150 per barrel to  the mid $30’s. That helped cushion the blow, but far from prevented the  Great Recession from happening. The cliff that commodities fell off of  this week makes it even clearer that inflation is not a big problem. If  anything, deflation is a bigger risk right now (another reason for more  monetary easing by the Fed).
"
841,FCX,"I found the decline in copper prices particularly alarming. Copper is  sometimes referred to as the metal with a Ph.D. in economics. It tumbled  to just $3.28 per pound, down an incredible 16% on the week, and off  from a record high of $4.55 back in February. The good doctor is  shouting about a coming economic slowdown. Commodity related stocks such  as Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOYG) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF  -  Free Report) were among the hardest-hit last week.
"
842,FCX,"Bullishness Fading, Bearishness Advancing
"
843,FCX,"Sentiment has turned overwhelmingly bearish. The American Association of  Individual Investors poll now has just 25.3% bulls, down 5.2% for the  week. That is 1.3 standard deviations below the historical average of  39.0%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment is at 48.0%, 1.8 standard deviations  above the historical norm of 30.0%.
"
844,FCX,"Valuations on stocks look very compelling, with the S&P trading from  just 11.8x 2011, and 10.4x 2012 earnings. Put in terms of earnings  yields, we are looking at 8.46% and 9.62%, while 10-year T-notes are  only at 1.83%.
"
845,FCX,"The old “Fed Model suggested that the forward earnings yield (call it  8.45%) should be in line with the 10-year note. Instead we have the  dividend yield on the S&P 500 higher than the 10-year note. If we  exclude the companies that pay no dividend (and thus yield 0% regardless  of where they trade) then 90% of all S&P 500 stocks yield more than  the five year, 70% yield more than the 10-year, and 40% yield more than  the 30-year Treasury.
"
846,FCX,"With the possible exception of the very depths of the 2008-09 crisis,  such valuations have not occurred in my lifetime. P/E's were low in the  1970’s, but that was in the context of very high inflation and interest  rates. From a long-term perspective, stocks look extremely undervalued  to me. 
"
847,FCX,"Valuations Compelling
"
848,FCX,"Long-term investors should start to take advantage of the current  valuations. However, I would not be shooting for the stars. Look for  those companies with solid dividends (say over 2.5%), low payout ratios,  solid balance sheets, and a history of rising dividends, which are  still seeing analysts raise their estimates for 2012, or are at least  not cutting them aggressively. I don’t know if you will be happy doing  so next week or even next month, but I am pretty sure that you will be  quite satisfied five years from now if you do so.
"
849,FCX,"Doing so will take a lot of intestinal fortitude. However, the time to  double-up is when you feel like getting sick. Looking at the world  economic situation and the action of the markets last week, my stomach  is feeling more than a little bit queasy.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseJust 15 firms have reported third quarter results. Total growth at 13.94%. We have a 2.25 surprise ratio, and 2.87% median surprise, both somewhat below normal. Positive surprises for 60.0% of all firms reporting.Positive year-over-year growth for 11, falling EPS for 4 firms -- a 2.75 ratio; 73.3% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Sample size is extremely small and not very representative; all the numbers are likely to change significantly from week to week.Pay very close attention to the % reported column in assessing the significance of sector level data.
"
850,FCX,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on, the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an ok start to things.

"
853,FCX,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2011, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.                    
"
854,FCX,"The attention now shifts to the third quarter earnings picture. We just have 15, or 3.0% of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far, so it is way too early draw any firm conclusions. The year-over-year growth rate for the S&P 500 is 13.9%, way off the 27.9% pace those same 15 firms posted in the second quarter.
"
855,FCX,"Of far more importance are the expectations for the 485 who have yet to report. Growth for them is expected to slow just slightly, to 9.97% over the third quarter of 2010, down from 10.09% year-over-year growth in the second quarter. However, the second quarter was distorted by some big hits to the financial sector.
"
856,FCX,"If we exclude the financials, growth in the third quarter is expected to slow to 12.02% year over year from 19.31%. Then again, at the beginning of earnings second quarter season, growth of 9.7% was expected, 12.2% ex-Financials.
"
857,FCX,"We will need another season where positive earnings surprises far outpace disappointments if we are going to match the second-quarter growth rate. On the top line, growth is also expected to slow sharply, to 5.20% in total from 11.04% in the second quarter, and excluding the financials to 8.95% from 13.21%.Net Margins Key to Growth
"
858,FCX,"Expanding net margins have been one of the keys to earnings growth. In the second quarter, total net margins were 9.14%, and excluding financials they were 9.13%, up from 9.10% and 7.95 ex-financials in the second quarter of 2010 (all 500). In the third quarter the financials net margins are expected to recover (we will see about that; it depends on the level of net charge-offs at the banks, which are sort of hard to predict). Thus, total net margins are expected (for the 485) to rise to 9.36%, while excluding financials they are expected to drop to 8.94%.
"
859,FCX,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.37% in 2009. They hit 8.63% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.22% in 2011 and 9.98% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.04% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.25% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.76% in 2011 and 9.22% in 2012.Full-Year Expectations
"
860,FCX,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $794.1 billion in 2010, up from $543.4 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $911.9 billion, or increases of 46.1% and 14.8%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 trillion mark to $1.037 trillion, for growth of 13.7%.
"
861,FCX,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $108.72. That is up from $56.96 for 2009, $83.24 for 2010, and $95.56 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 1.83%, a P/E of 13.6x based on 2010 and 11.8x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is just 10.4x.Estimate Revisions Near Seasonal Low
"
862,FCX,"Estimate revisions activity is near a seasonal low. What has really been drying up is estimate increases, as those made immediately after the second quarter positive earnings surprise roll off the four-week moving total I track. The number of cuts has also declined, but not nearly as sharply and as a result the ratio of increases to cuts is now at a very bearish level of 0.45 for 2011 and just 0.35 for 2012.
"
863,FCX,"If those ratios stay in that area when total revision activity heats up (as it will dramatically over the next month or so) it will be a reason for very serious concern. The net cuts are very widespread, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling is down to 0.55 for this year and to 0.42 for next year, and every sector has more cuts than increases for both this year and next.
"
864,FCX,"In light of the generally downbeat economic news, it is not surprising that we are not seeing a lot of estimate increases without the catalyst of positive earnings surprises. During slow revisions periods, the revisions ratio is generally less significant that during periods of high activity, but that does not mean that it should be ignored completely, and it is flashing a yellow caution light pretty brightly now.
"
865,FCX,"The strong earnings performance we have seen, particularly in large multinational company earnings (like most of the S&P 500 I track in this report) is the single most important argument in the bulls favor (along with the low valuations based on those earnings). Thus if that starts to crack in a big way, it is a very big concern.Recap of Key Data and Events of Last Week
"
866,FCX,"The economic news this week was mostly, but not entirely, on the downbeat side. Housing Starts were down by 5.0% for the month and 5.8% from a year ago. They have been more or less moving sideways at extremely depressed levels (down apx. 75% from peak) for well over two years now. Thus the weakness was not exactly shocking, but it was not very encouraging either.
"
867,FCX,"On the plus side, the lack of new building means that we are not adding much to inventory. Of course, that does not help out the employment situation much. Looking forward, there was a 3.2% increase in building permits. No real reason for celebration there, but it offsets the weakness in starts.
"
868,FCX,"Used home sales were better than expected, posting a 7.7% rise on the month and up 18.6% from a year ago. The year-ago number was depressed from the end of the homebuilder tax credit, so I would not be extrapolating that year-over-year gain.
"
869,FCX,"Inventories dropped by 3.0% on the month, causing the months supply to fall to 8.5 from 9.5. Still too high but moving in the right direction. On the commercial real estate front the Architects billing index turned slightly positive after being negative for five months -- a small positive sign for 2012.  
"
870,FCX,"Initial Claims for jobless benefits fell to 423,000. Again -- lousy level, but right direction. We really need to see that number fall below the 400,000 level to indicate the job market is returning to health. Given the severity of the jobs crisis, it will take some time to heal, even after we get below that level. That is the level that would indicate that the economy is producing enough jobs on balance to start to bring down the unemployment rate. Not there yet.
"
871,FCX,"Looking at just the U.S. data for the week, and with very few earnings reports out (and those on balance positive) you would have thought we would have sort of a flat week for the market. Instead, we had the worst one since late 2008. However, it is not just the U.S. economy that affects the market. We got some weak numbers out of both Europe and China as well, and that helped throw the market for a loop.
"
872,FCX,"The Greek saga continued with alternating news about if they would get the next installment of their aid package. I think they will get this one, but the one after that will be a bigger hurdle. I still think the question is when -- not if -- Greece defaults. And the question is days or weeks, not quarters or years.Twist and Shout
"
873,FCX,"The big news of the week was the Fed coming out with “Operation Twist."" It will sell $400 billion of short-term t-bills and notes and buy an equivalent amount of longer-term paper. This is sort of like the Kim Kardashian of monetary policy actions -- it is unexplainably popular, does not do much and is all about the back end.
"
874,FCX,"At the margin it could lower long-term interest rates a little bit, possibly at the expense of higher short-term rates, but given the pledge to keep very short rates under 0.25% through 2013, there will probably be very little effect (even less than on the long end) on short rates. The downside of this is that it flattens the yield curve, which hurts bank net interest margins.
"
875,FCX,"It is not like the real problem in the economy is that interest rates anywhere on the yield curve are too high. Even the 30-year T-bond is yielding only 2.90%, and the 10-year is at 1.83%. Right off the bat it looks like the policy has been very successful in bringing down long-term rates, as long-term treasuries tumbled to even lower historic lows.
"
876,FCX,"So what will bringing them down by another handful of basis points accomplish? Next to nothing.
"
877,FCX,"Just about every market other than the long-end of the bond market did not take kindly the action. I don’t think that it is particularly harmful, just impotent. I suspect this tacit admission of impotence by the Fed is the real reason the market was so weak after the announcement. The other implication is that the bond market is shouting that inflation is not a problem and that the government is not crowding out private investment.
"
878,FCX,"The Fed also moved from saying that the downside risks to the economy are increasing to saying that there are significant downside risks to the economy. In other news, the sun rose in the east today. Many commentators pointed to that statement as the reason for the weakness, but I didn’t think it revealed anything that anyone taking even a cursory glance at the economic numbers has was not already thinking.What the Fed Could Have Done/Might Still Do
"
879,FCX,"I was, however, disappointed that the Fed did not take a step that I think would have an impact, and which would actually save the government some money. It should have stopped paying interest on excess reserves. In effect the Fed is now paying banks not to lend, which is the exact opposite of what we need them to do. OK, its not that much -- just 0.25% -- but on about $1.7 billion of excess reserves, it adds up to almost $4 billion.
"
880,FCX,"There are two additional options that the Fed has left. One would be to embark on QE3, which would effectively be doing half of Operation Twist -- just the buying part. However, if the Fed did that they would effectively be telling the GOP establishment to go jump in a lake. In light of the explicit warnings not to go down that path, if Chairman Bernanke were to so, the Fed would be painted as being a tool of the Obama administration.
"
881,FCX,"The other step the Fed could take would to be to explicitly target a higher inflation rate. That is a step that would run directly against the grain of any Central Banker. However, if people credibly believed that inflation would be running at, say, 4% for the next five years or so, then the last thing businesses would want to be holding would be cash. Such a step, though, is fraught with the potential for unexpected consequences, and I seriously doubt they will go down that path.Empty Toolbox
"
882,FCX,"With the Fed now seen as out of ammo, and fiscal policy off the table due to political gridlock (and headed on the wrong path towards austerity) the government is not able to do anything to head off a potential double dip recession. The economy remains extremely fragile and susceptible to outside shocks. The turmoil in Europe -- the destination for about 25% of our exports -- has plenty of potential to be just such a shock.
"
883,FCX,"Passing the American Jobs Act (AJA) would be extremely helpful in heading off a renewed recession, but given the political dynamics right now, that is just not going to happen. If it (or something like it) does not pass, then not only will the economy not get any additional stimulus, but fiscal policy will be leaning heavily towards actively slowing the economy.
"
884,FCX,"The biggest feature of the AJA is an expansion of the payroll tax cut. It would increase the size of the payroll tax cut from 2% of the first $106,800 someone earns to 3% on the individual side, and also introduce cuts in the payroll tax on the employer side, particularly targeted at small businesses. For the median household (including households of one) that would mean about $500 more in after tax income than in 2011.
"
885,FCX,"In contrast, if nothing is done, the 2011 payroll tax cut will expire, and the median household will have $1,000 less to spend. That will be a huge hit to consumer demand (about 70% of the economy) and would result in even more unemployment. While small businesses and their owners are often referred to as the ""job creators,"" that is not really the case.
"
886,FCX,"Yes, historically most new paychecks have been signed by the owners of small businesses. However, no business, large of small, is going to hire people if they don’t think that there are customers for their goods or services. It is customers who are the job creators, not businesses, large or small. It is uncertainty about the number of customers, not about taxes or regulations, which are keeping businesses from hiring.
"
887,FCX,"In 2010, real median income dropped 2.3% from 2009 levels and is now 6.4% below where it was at the start of the Great Recession and 7.1% below its 1999 peak. We also learned that the poverty rate rose to 15.1% in 2010 from 14.3% in 2009, and from 12.5% in 2007 before the start of the Great Recession. People in poverty do not make great customers, and thus are not very good job creators. For more on the poverty report, see this article.  A Lot Resting on Congress
"
888,FCX,"The thrust of the “American Jobs Act runs directly counter to the thrust of the debt-ceiling deal. The “Super Committee of six Democrats and six Republicans that is charged with coming up with $1.5 Trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade is on the road to failure.
"
889,FCX,"If they cannot come up with an agreement by November 23rd, or if Congress does not pass the package by December 23rd, then automatic spending cuts of $1.2 Trillion kick in. Half of those would be to defense, and half to non-defense (mostly discretionary) spending. That is a meat-cleaver approach and will be front-end loaded, with big cuts starting in 2013.
"
890,FCX,"It is clear to me that the Super Committee is going to be deadlocked and/or whatever they come up with will not pass Congress or be signed by President Obama. Thus, the market has to start to price in some of those meat-cleaver cuts.
"
891,FCX,"The other possibility would be that the next Congress decides to cancel the whole thing. That would require a very large shift in Congress in the 2012 elections, and that Congress would not take office until January of 2013, which would be cutting things very close. Any repeal of debt-ceiling deal -- now law -- would be subject to filibuster, and as such would require 60 votes in the Senate. The odds of that happening are extremely low.Focusing on the Wrong Deficit
"
892,FCX,"Policy makers remain far too focused on the wrong deficit. The trade deficit is a big part of what is ailing the economy. Right now the budget deficit is not (it could well be a problem down the road, but it is not causing big problems now. If it were, the government would not be able to borrow for 30 years at just 2.90%).
"
893,FCX,"Bringing down the trade deficit will require a weaker dollar, but last week, the dollar was just about the only thing that went up in price, along with T-notes. (An energy policy aimed at moving towards using domestic Natural Gas as a transportation fuel replacing imported oil would also go a very long way towards brining down the trade deficit, ad getting the economy moving again.)
"
894,FCX,"Currency values are always relative, and a weak Dollar requires a strong Euro, the second-most important currency in the world (with a huge gap between it and number three, which would either be the Yen or the Pound). The current mess in Europe is not conducive to a strong Euro.
"
895,FCX,"The end result was an extremely weak market last week, the worst one we have had since the 2008 crisis was in full bloom. Against the very poor macro-backdrop, one has to look at the valuations that stocks are currently have. Those to me look wildly attractive, particularly if the current earnings expectations (or anything close to them) can be achieved.
"
896,FCX,"Market Pricing in a New Recession?
"
897,FCX,"At these levels, it is clear to me that the market is pricing in not just slower growth, but an outright recession -- either underway or just about to get underway. If it turns out that we avoid an outright recession, and the decline in profits that usually comes with one, then the market should rally from here.
"
898,FCX,"As I noted above, the expectations are starting to come down, particularly for 2012, but the vast majority of stocks, and every economic sector is expected to earn more in 2012 than in 2011. The decline in the revisions ratio is mostly driven right now by the drying up of new estimate increases, rather than a flood of new estimate cuts. It is entirely normal at this point seasonally for overall revisions activity to slow down dramatically.
"
899,FCX,"Not only were stocks down hard, commodities got hit even harder -- including gold and silver. More importantly, oil prices fell sharply, which acts as a tax cut for the developed world (not just the U.S. but also Europe and Japan as well). That should help to offset some, but certainly not even close to all, of the current economic headwinds.
"
900,FCX,"In the Great Recession oil prices plunged from almost $150 per barrel to the mid $30’s. That helped cushion the blow, but far from prevented the Great Recession from happening. The cliff that commodities fell off of this week makes it even clearer that inflation is not a big problem. If anything, deflation is a bigger risk right now (another reason for more monetary easing by the Fed).
"
901,FCX,"I found the decline in copper prices particularly alarming. Copper is sometimes referred to as the metal with a Ph.D. in economics. It tumbled to just $3.28 per pound, down an incredible 16% on the week, and off from a record high of $4.55 back in February. The good doctor is shouting about a coming economic slowdown. Commodity related stocks such as Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOYG) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF  -  Free Report) were among the hardest-hit last week.
"
902,FCX,"Bullishness Fading, Bearishness Advancing
"
903,FCX,"Sentiment has turned overwhelmingly bearish. The American Association of Individual Investors poll now has just 25.3% bulls, down 5.2% for the week. That is 1.3 standard deviations below the historical average of 39.0%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment is at 48.0%, 1.8 standard deviations above the historical norm of 30.0%.
"
904,FCX,"Valuations on stocks look very compelling, with the S&P trading from just 11.8x 2011, and 10.4x 2012 earnings. Put in terms of earnings yields, we are looking at 8.46% and 9.62%, while 10-year T-notes are only at 1.83%.
"
905,FCX,"The old “Fed Model suggested that the forward earnings yield (call it 8.45%) should be in line with the 10-year note. Instead we have the dividend yield on the S&P 500 higher than the 10-year note. If we exclude the companies that pay no dividend (and thus yield 0% regardless of where they trade) then 90% of all S&P 500 stocks yield more than the five year, 70% yield more than the 10-year, and 40% yield more than the 30-year Treasury.
"
906,FCX,"With the possible exception of the very depths of the 2008-09 crisis, such valuations have not occurred in my lifetime. P/E's were low in the 1970’s, but that was in the context of very high inflation and interest rates. From a long-term perspective, stocks look extremely undervalued to me.

908,FCX,"Long-term investors should start to take advantage of the current valuations. However, I would not be shooting for the stars. Look for those companies with solid dividends (say over 2.5%), low payout ratios, solid balance sheets, and a history of rising dividends, which are still seeing analysts raise their estimates for 2012, or are at least not cutting them aggressively. I don’t know if you will be happy doing so next week or even next month, but I am pretty sure that you will be quite satisfied five years from now if you do so.

910,FCX,"Total Industrial Production rose 0.2% in August, which was above the expected unchanged reading. It is slower than the July increase of 0.9%, which was unrevised.  The June reading was revised down to a 0.1% increase from 0.4%. The absolute increase is on the anemic side, but at least it was better than expected, and the underlying details are stronger than the headline number would suggest (not great, but better than 0.2%). Relative to a year ago, total Industrial Production is up 3.4%. In normal times, that would be OK, but for coming out of a deep recession, it is anemic and is a substantial slowdown from what we were seeing last year.
"
911,FCX,"Total Industrial Production includes not only the output of the nation's factories, but of its mines and utility power plants as well. The production and consumption of electricity generally has as much to do with the weather as it does with overall economic activity. A big part of the weakness this month came from the Utilities. This could be a Hurricane Irene effect, as millions were left without power. Also, the heat wave in the South, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma, was more intense in July than August, and thus the need for air conditioning was not quite as intense.Thus it is important to look at just how the manufacturing sector is doing alone. It was up 0.5% in August, down from a 0.6% increase in July (unrevised) but better than the unchanged reading for June (revised down from a 0.2% increase). Year over year factory output was up 3.8%. The increase this month still makes this a very solid performance, and much better than expected (although we don't have an official consensus expectation for manufacturing output alone - at least it was better than I was expecting).  Part of the increase in factory output is probably due to the easing of supply chain constraints growing out of the disaster in Japan.Utility output plunged by 3.0%, reversing a jump of 2.8% in July (most likely due to the Texas Heat wave). In June, utility output edged lower by 0.1%. Year over year Utility output is down 2.4%. The utility number is mostly about weather, not changes in economic activity, and can be very volatile.  The manufacturing only number is a better gauge of overall economic activity.The third sector tracked by the report is Mining (including oil and natural gas). The output of the nation’s mines rose by 1.2% in August, up from a 1.1% increase in August, and up from June’s 0.5% rise. Year over year mine output is up 5.6%. That is a very solid performance, and reflects rising domestic oil and gas production, largely due to the new shale plays (mostly in North Dakota for Oil and in the Marcellus Shale of the Northeast for natural gas).By stage of production, output of finished goods rose by 0.4%, after a 0.9% increase in July and a 0.3% decline in June. Relative to a year ago finished goods production is up 3.3%. Finished goods are separated into consumer goods and business equipment, and there is a real dichotomy between the two. Consumers are trying hard to rebuild their balance sheets; businesses on the other hand, especially large businesses, have extremely strong balance sheets. That means consumers are spending less on current consumption while paying down debt and building up savings. That is a tough thing to do when you are unemployed, but the 90.9% of people who are working are doing their best to get their personal fiscal houses in order. In addition, a large part of consumer finished goods are imports, not made here in the U.S.  Output of finished consumer goods was up 0.2% in August, down from an increase of 0.9% in July but up from a decline of 0.4% in June.  Year over year, output of consumer goods is up just 1.2%.Business equipment output on the other hand has been consistently strong. It rose 0.7% in August, down from an increase of 1.1% in July but up from an increase of just 0.1% in June. Still, a 0.7% increase for the month is very respectable. Business equipment production is up 9.4% from a year ago. Business investment in Equipment and Software has been one of the strongest parts of the economy, contributing 0.55 points of the 1.00% total growth in the economy in the second quarter, even though it makes up just 7.33% of GDP. The first two thirds of the third quarter are very strong in this regard, so look for investment in Equipment and Software to be another solid contributor to growth in the third quarter.While I would not expect spectacular results, this data suggests that we might see a bit of acceleration from the anemic 1.0% pace of the second quarter. However, it is not likely to be above the 2.0% growth rate we really need to start to bring down unemployment in any significant way.Output of materials rose 0.1%, way down from the 0.9% rise in July and the 0.6% increase in June. Materials output is up 3.9% year over year.  The first graph below (from http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/) shows the long term path of total industrial production (blue) and manufacturing only industrial production (red). As manufacturing output is the bulk of total output, it is not surprising that the two lines track pretty well with each other over longer periods of time. While we are in much better shape than we were a year ago, production is still well below pre-recession levels. That is not particularly unusual two years after the end of a recession. In the Great Recession it fell much more than it had in any previous downturn. Notice however, that the slope of both lines in this recovery is much steeper than in previous recoveries.The other side of the report is Capacity Utilization. This is one of the most under appreciated economic indicators out there, and one that deserves a lot more attention and ink than it usually gets. Total capacity utilization suffers from the same weather-related drawback as does Industrial Production. Total Capacity Utilization was at 77.4%, in line with expectations. However, July was revised down to 77.3% from 77.5%, and June was revised down to 76.7% from 76.9%.  Thus, it is ambiguous whether the total industrial production actually increased or decreased for the month. It is better than the current read of last month, but worse than we thought last month was. The revival of capacity utilization has been going on for over two years now. A year ago, just 75.5% of our overall capacity was being used, and that was up from a record low of 67.3% in June 2009.The basic rule of thumb on total capacity utilization is that if it gets up above 85%, the economy is booming and in severe danger of overheating. This effectively raises a red flag at the Fed and tells them that they need to raise short term interest rates to cool the economy. It is also a signal to Congress that it is time to either cut spending or raise taxes, also to cool down the economy (Congress seldom listens to what capacity utilization is saying, but the Fed does).Congress now wants to do what would be appropriate at capacity utilization levels of 85, when the actual level is less than 78. Capacity utilization of around 80 signals a nice healthy economy; sort of the Goldilocks level, not to hot, not to cold. The long term average level is 80.4%. A level of 75% is usually associated with a recession. The Great Recession was the only one on record where it fell below 70%. Thus a 10.1 point improvement in overall capacity utilization from the lows is highly significant and very good news. On the other hand, we still have a long way to go for the economy to be considered healthy.The second graph (also from Calculated Risk) shows the path of capacity utilization (total and manufacturing) since 1967. Note that the previous expansion was sort of on the pathetic side when it came to capacity utilization, barely getting over the long term average at its peak; the previous two expansions both hit the 85% overheating mark (the 1990s doing so on two separate occasions).  It does not signal a good economy by any stretch of the imagination, but it also looks like fears that we were already falling back into recession are overblown. On the other hand, these days industrial output makes up a much smaller share of the overall economy than it used to.Given the weather influences on Utility Utilization, and thus the total, it is important to look at how Manufacturing alone is doing. Factory utilization rose to 75.0% from 74.7% in July, but that was only after July was revised down from 75.0%, so it would be equally valid to see factory utilization as being unchanged. June was also revised down to 74.4% from 74.6%.  Factory utilization is up from 72.6% a year ago, and the cycle (and record) low of 64.4% in June 2009. That is still well below the long term average level of 79.0%, so, as with total capacity, we still have a long way to go on the factory utilization level.Total capacity rose by 0.9% over the last year, but most of that expansion came in the Mine and Utility segments. Manufacturing capacity is up 0.4% from a year ago.  Increased capacity is a headwind for increased capacity utilization, but at the current level it is a breeze, not a gale, particularly for manufacturing. For most of the last two years we have seen year over year declines in capacity, but now that is turning around. While shrinking capacity makes it easier to use the remaining capacity at a higher level, it is not a good sign for the economy. It represents a permanent loss rather than a temporary idling of the country’s economic potential.Mines were working at 90.8% of capacity in August, up from 89.9% in July and from 89.0% in June. A year ago they were operating at 87.7%, and the cycle low was 79.0%.  We are actually now above the long term average of 87.4% of capacity. When we are at or above the long term average, minor fluctuations should not be a big macro concern.   Since there is a lot of operating leverage in most mining companies, this probably means very good things for the profitability of mining firms with big U.S. operations like Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) and Peabody Energy (BTU). Mine capacity increased 2.0% year over year, making the year over year increase in capacity utilization even more impressive.As depreciation is more than just an accounting exercise when it comes to mining equipment, the high operating rates are also good news for the equipment makers like Joy Global (JOYG) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), although the U.S. is a relatively small part of their overall business.Utility utilization plunged to 78.7% from 81.2% in July and 79.4% in June. A year ago Utilities were operating at 82.8%, We are far below the long term average utilization of 86.6%. We are actually now below the 2009 low of 79.2%! Increasing utility utilization faces a headwind because our power plant capacity has actually been increasing even faster than our mine capacity, up 2.7% year over year. The sharp drop for the month though has more to do with weather than the increase in capacity.By stage of processing, utilization of facilities producing crude goods (including the output of mines) rose to 88.1% from 87.6% in July and up from 87.0% in June. A year ago crude good facilities were operating at 86.3% of capacity, and the cycle low was 77.6%.  We are now above the long term average of 86.4%.  Considering that crude goods capacity is up by 1.6%, a very solid showing.Utilization for primary, or semi finished goods fell to 74.4% from 74.7% in July. While that is much better than the 72.8% level of a year ago, and the cycle low of 64.9%, it is a very long way from the long term average of 81.4%.  Part of the year over year increase is simply due to shrinking capacity, which was down 0.1%.Utilization of facilities producing finished goods rose to 76.4% from 76.0% in July and from 75.6% in June. It is up from 74.2% a year ago, and a cycle low of 66.8%. It remains slightly below its long term average of 77.3%, but we are getting closer. Interestingly, our capacity to produce finished goods has actually increased by 1.6% over the last year, so the rise in utilization there is facing a fairly still headwind. Part of that is due to Utilities, since electricity is considered a finished good.Overall, this report was a fairly good one; better than it appears at first glance. The increase in Industrial production was better than expected, and that was in the face of a massive decline in the utility segment. The revisions for July were more or less neutral with capacity utilization revised down but production unchanged.  In other words the downward revision in utilization came from an upward revision in capacity. That is a long term positive for the economy.The numbers for June, though, were revised lower, so it is not advised to get too excited about this report. We are actually starting to see increases in capacity, unlike the declines we were seeing last year, and while that hurts capacity utilization, it is a positive sign for the economy’s long term potential.While the economy is recovering, it is still running at levels far below its potential. The capacity utilization numbers can be thought of as similar to the employment rate from physical capital, much like the employment to population ratio is the employment rate for human capital. Both are running well below where we want them to be. While additional monetary stimulus would be useful at the margin, the cost of capital is not the major issue right now; it is lack of aggregate demand. As such, additional fiscal stimulus would be much more effective in getting the economy going again.Unfortunately, the debate in DC has nothing to do with getting the economy going faster; it is all about the short term budget deficit. The latest Obama proposal would be useful in getting the economy going by raising the after tax incomes of the vast majority of workers, and thus raising total demand.  If it is not passed, after tax incomes for the median worker will fall by about $1,000, further slowing the economy. That would be pennywise and pound foolish in the extreme.Getting the economy back into high gear would also start to raise tax revenues, and so the net cost of additional stimulus should be less than the advertised amount. The tax increases/deduction eliminations to pay for the program will offset some, but hardly all, of the positive impact of the program. Big cuts in spending now, as many in Congress are demanding, will slow the economy significantly to the tune of hundreds of thousands fewer jobs being created this year and in 2012. That means fewer people without income, and hence fewer people paying income taxes.We have been seeing anti-stimulus from the State and Local level throughout the Great Recession, and it is the total amount of fiscal stimulus that counts for the economy, not just what happens at the Federal level. De-stimulus from the lower levels of government has offset about half of the Federal Stimulus we got from the ARRA. The main stimulus from both QE2 and last December’s tax deal will wear off at the end of 2011. Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization rebounded strongly while the ARRA funds were going out. With fiscal policy on the verge of turning deeply concretionary, there is a very good chance that they will start to fall again. Deep spending cuts don’t just kill jobs, they also idle physical capacity as well.The attempt to cut spending now is deeply misguided. The U.K. has gone down that path, and the net result was that its economy fell by 0.5% in the fourth quarter and only grew by 0.5% in the first quarter and by 0.2% in the second quarter, far below the U.S. growth rate. China took the most simulative fiscal path after the financial meltdown, and now it is concerned about its economy overheating. We have taken a moderately simulative path with overall fiscal policy (stimulus at the Federal Level offset by austerity at the State and Local level) and grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter and just 0.4% in the first, rebounding ever so slightly to 1.0% growth in the second quarter.Budget cuts that end up slowing the overall growth of the economy will slow the recovery in tax revenues and will result in much less progress on cutting the deficit than is advertised. As a general rule of thumb (a.k.a. Okun's law), we need real GDP growth of over 2.0% to see unemployment fall significantly. We might get above that level in the second half, but not much and not for sure. We should see some pick up in growth in the second half, as some of the temporary headwinds fade, such as the surge in oil prices and the effects of the Japanese Tsunami. However, massive fiscal contraction could be a major new headwind that will keep growth sub par, and the unemployment high and possibly even rising.While the effects of the actual Japanese Tsunami are fading, there is a potential figurative Tsunami coming from Europe as the Euro project seems to be in its death throes. The disruption potential from that is huge. Unless Europe can move towards fiscal integration in a big way, the demise of the Euro seems inevitable, but the timing is an open question. The political obstacles of fiscal integration in Europe are massive, and I don’t think they will happen. While I would like to see the project succeed as it would make another major European war almost impossible, and would lead to greater long term prosperity, I doubt that it will happen. On the other hand, the short term damage done from trying to unscramble the Euro egg could be massive, so those 17 countries may have no choice.RELATED ARTICLESInital Jobless Claims Jump AgainCPI Up 0.4%, Core Up 0.2%Inflation, Jobs & Manufacturing

931,FCX,"I would only add a footnote to #6 by saying that the weak dollar is especially good for the US economy right now for several reasons including more competitive exports, cheaper debt management, and inflation that spurs GDP and job growth.

944,FCX,"Industrial metals are considered the building blocks of an economy. Despite global concerns adding an element of uncertainty to the outlook lately, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long term.Here we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months and years:Automotive & Aerospace to Fuel GrowthOn the demand side, aluminum consumption is anticipated to improve on a global basis, spurred on by the automotive and packaging industries — the key end markets. The automobile market is becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties.Automakers consumed a record amount of aluminum last year as plummeting prices and technological breakthroughs made it a viable alternative to steel. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is projected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) is well positioned to capture the growing demand for aluminium sheet due to the transition of the North American auto industry to lightweighting. It is the market leader in providing aluminium sheet to the North American automotive market. The company leverages its breakthrough Micromill technology that manufactures the most advanced aluminium sheet on the market.The Micromill process produces an aluminium alloy that has 40% greater formability and 30% greater strength than the current automotive aluminium. Arconic expects its automotive sheet revenues to grow to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $76 million in 2010.The airline industry is also anticipated to boost demand for the metal. Arconic has a long-term agreement with Boeing to supply multi-material aerospace parts, its fourth multi-year contract with the aerospace giant in a series of recentdeals. Arconic also has big aerospace deals with Airbus and Lockheed Martin.Arconic also has a multi-year supply contract with Brazil-based leading commercial jets maker Embraer, worth around $470 million. The company also sealed a contract valued roughly $1 billion for the supply of proprietary alloys and plate products for every Airbus platform.Construction Remains a Pillar of StrengthThe housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and consequently, of iron ore. The construction sector is the second most rapidly growing sector after transportation in terms of aluminum usage. Building construction (pipes and wires) is also the largest market for copper.An uptrend has been noticed in real estate activity, like new home initiatives and construction spends, in the United States in the past few quarters. Long-stalled construction projects are being renewed. Requirement for emerging projects, such as education facilities and government buildings, is also creating demand in the sector.In the long term, as the urban population increases worldwide, so will the need for steel with the need to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure. Emerging economies will also continue to be major catalysts to support increasing urbanization and industrialization. Naturally, a rebound in construction bodes well for the iron ore and copper industries.Rectifying the Demand — Supply ImbalanceAfter aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry underwent substantial changes to correct the supply-demand picture. This will eventually lead to firm prices. RUSAL had resorted to aluminum production cuts in the past few years. Likewise, Arconic has undertaken a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters) in the last few years, apart from aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions.Additionally, curtailments in China are expected to create aluminum deficit this year. Further, faced with smog in major cities, China is clamping down on polluting industries. With its high energy intensity and reliance on coal, aluminum could be in the forefront if Chinese government does take steps against polluting industries.Similarly, China’s policy to clean up and consolidate the domestic steel industry is also working in favor of iron ore.Much Hope Pinned on TrumpThe industrial metals space has benefited from the Trump win. Trump’s promise to revive American infrastructure means commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will gain under his presidency.Pickup in Economic Activity to Drive Copper DemandCopper is a major industrial metal playing a particularly important role in emerging countries. Given its varied applications, the trends in the copper market are often considered useful indicators of the state of the global economy.Developments in the world economy are strongly correlated with movements in copper prices. Given that China accounts for the largest share of global copper consumption as well as having a large share in the total production of pure copper, it’s no surprise that there is a strong correlation of the metal with ups and downs in its economy.For the long haul, expectations are for a rising middle class in Asia, particularly in India and China, who are likely to spend more on consumer goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators in the coming years. This will stimulate demand for copper. Chinese demand for the metal is also likely to grow to comprise 46% of the worldwide copper consumption by 2018.India to Support Demand Going AheadPer the World Steel Association, India’s prospects look bright due to consumption-boosting reforms and favorable policies to improve infrastructure and manufacturing output. Also, International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) projects India’s GDP growth to rise to 6.7% this year and 7.4% in the next year. Given that India's consumption of metals has almost doubled in the past 20 years, it will be a major consumer in the years to come.Renewed Optimism in ChinaChina reported third-quarter GDP growth of 6.8%, a tad lower than the second quarter's 6.9% expansion. The IMF forecast for growth in China is pegged at 6.8% for 2017. It is perceived that with an inflation-adjusted growth of 6.9% in the first half, China’s economy is on track to meet or likely exceed Beijing’s full-year target of around 6.5%.Copper Demand from Electric VehiclesThe booming market for electric vehicles will significantly impact demand for copper over the next decade. Electric vehicles use a substantial amount of copper in their batteries, as well as in the windings and copper rotors used in electric motors. The metal is also required for busbars, used to connect modules and cells in battery packs, and in charging infrastructure. Big players like BHP Billiton Ltd.

945,FCX,"Industrial metals such as iron, aluminum and copper are essential to regular technology and infrastructure. President Trump’s promise to go on an infrastructure binge naturally gave a boost to the price of industrial metals. Growth in U.S. GDP and continued improvement in end-use sectors like automotive, aerospace, construction and packaging also bode well for metals.In fact, in the third quarter of 2017, base metals (copper, lead, nickel, zinc) were the best-performing commodities sector, recording a 10.74% gain. At the end of the quarter, the prices had gained around 16% since the onset of the year. This was mainly driven by aggressive buying of metals and other raw materials in China during the quarter.The Chinese economy has lately been showing signs of improvement. China is widely expected to stimulate growth with further construction and infrastructure building projects. Prices have also gained on China's drive to clean up its environment and improve infrastructure.Also, the U.S.-North Korea imbroglio may have pushed China to add on its strategic stockpiles of commodities. Tight supplies also aided in boosting prices, with zinc, aluminum and copper boasting the biggest gains. Industrial metals are sensitive to Chinese GDP growth, inflation and the U.S. dollar — all of which were tailwinds to the industrial metals in the quarter.Let’s take a closer look at the recent price movement of a few important metals and what lies ahead.IronIron, the main ingredient in steel moved in the opposite direction of the non-ferrous metals, dipping 0.32% in the third quarter and 22.79% so far in 2017.The decline in iron ore prices was due to expectations of a fall in China’s steel demand as authorities tighten creditconditions. As steel capacity cuts planned for Chinese mills in winter months are approaching, the prospects of iron ore demand is looking bleaker. To curb pollution, the government has mandated steelmakers to cut as much as 50% of production. China consumes more than two-thirds of the seaborne iron ore market and produces as much steel as the rest of the world combined.In September, imports of high-quality iron ore fines and lump ore from Australia, Brazil and South Africa crossed 100 million tons, a record high. The scene reversed in October with a 23% plunge to 79.5 million tons. The record import caused domestic inventories to swell while requirements from Chinese steelmakers dwindled given regulatory restrictions.The second reason for weakness in the iron ore market is seasonal as China’s imports of iron ore tend to move to their lowest level in October because of a National Holiday and weather issues that impact construction during winter months.AluminumOver the last few years, the slowdown in Europe and China has not been positive for the metal, as it weighed on demand. There were massive stockpiles of aluminum in LME warehouses. However, aluminum industry fundamentals have improved considerably since 2016 with its markets recording a supply deficit in 2016 – the first in a decade.Aluminum increased 11.42% in the third quarter of 2017 and recorded a 25.37% gain in 2017 at the close of the third quarter. Aluminum prices have been gaining this year owing to improved supply-demand dynamics, Trump’s win and higher coal prices. China’s directive toward capacity cut and Trump’s insistence on trade reforms spread optimism in the market, lifting aluminum prices.CopperAfter vastly underperforming other metals in 2016, copper experienced a sudden spike at the end. Pick up in global manufacturing activity and hopes of Trump's $500 billion infrastructure drove the red metal’s recovery. Renewed optimism about economic strength in the top consumer China and indications of tighter global mine supply aided prices this year.Supply disruptions at some of the key copper mines, including BHP Billiton Limited’s (BHP  -  Free Report) Escondida mine in Chile earlier this year and a strike action at Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s (FCX  -  Free Report) Grasberg operations in Indonesia, led to the decline in mined copper production and provide a boost to the price. Another factor that contributed to copper’s rally is a sharp drop in output from Codelco — the world’s biggest copper producer. On Sep 5, the Chilean state copper company said that production for first-half 2017 from its copper operations fell to 798,000 tons from 843,000 tons a year ago.At Q3 end, copper was at $2.9475 per pound, having gained 9.21%. In the first three quarters of this year, copper prices have gained 17.50%.Industry Positioning – PositiveThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks. The way to look at the complete list of industries is that, we put our industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)Within the Zacks Industry classification, the Mining-Iron and Mining-Non Ferrous industries (aluminum, copper, etc.) are grouped under the Basic Material sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). The non-ferrous mining industry, with a Zacks Industry Rank #60, is in the top 23%. The iron mining industry occupies space in the top 46% of the Zacks classified industries, with a Rank of #117.Improved Performance Year-to-date, the Mining-Iron and Mining-Non Ferrous industries have recorded a respective rise of 32.9% and 24.9%. The industries have outperformed both the Basic Material sector’s increase of 19.3% and the S&P 500’s corresponding advance of 16.9%.Attractive on the Valuation FrontValuation looks attractive for both the industries going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like iron and non-ferrous industries. The mining-iron industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.27 and the mining-ferrous industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.93.Both these compare favorably with the broader Basic Materials Sector’s EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.39 and S&P 500 EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.35. The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Q3 Earnings Scorecard, ProjectionsThe basic materials sector logged a 2.6% increase in third-quarter earnings. The earnings growth graph for the sector will pick up fourth quarter onward. Earnings growth will be 29.9% in fourth-quarter 2017, 18.3% in first-quarter 2018, 13.7% in the second and 9.7% in third-quarter 2018. (Read more: Plenty of Positive Retail Surprises).What’s in Store?Iron: Global steel production rose 5.6% year over year during the first nine months of 2017 to 1267 million tons. The World Steel Association forecasts global steel demand to go up 7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. China’s steel demand is expected to increase by 3.0% in 2017. This will boost demand for iron ore.The supply surge resulting from Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) S11D, Rio Tinto plc’s (RIO  -  Free Report) Pilbara projects, and BHP Billiton Limited’s projects will create a surplus in the already well-supplied iron ore market. However, China is planning to cut steel capacity to reduce pollution in the country. By 2020, the government aims to trim 100-150 million tons of steel capacity. Sustained capacity rationalization could lead to higher steel prices, which in turn should support iron ore prices.Aluminum: Global aluminium markets are expected to be in a deficit in 2017. China’s demand, which accounts for about half of total demand, is likely to be sustained by the building and construction sector as well as the automotive and railway sectors. With the country deciding to cut capacity, supply will also be checked.Moreover, in North America, demand should remain robust, mainly due to the building and construction, automotive, packaging and airline industries. India appears promising given its current low levels of aluminum consumptionand high urban population growth.Copper: As per the International Copper Study Group (ICSG), copper is headed for a deficit of about 150,000 tons in 2017 and about 105,000 tons in 2018. Copper prices are likely to be influenced by demand from China, India and emerging markets, as well as economic activity in the United States and other industrialized countries.The timing of the development of new supplies of copper, along with production levels of mines and copper smelters are also anticipated to influence price. The long-term fundamentals of the metal remain positive, supported by its significant role in the global economy and a challenging long-term supply environment.To Sum UpWe believe that pulling the reins on supply will stabilize prices. Trump's infrastructure push should also provide some support. Projection of earnings growth also instils investor confidence in the industrial metals space.For investors keen on playing these industries, we recommend Amerigo Resources Ltd. (ARREF  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the last 30 days, earnings estimates for Amerigo Resources have gone skyrocketed 500% for 2017 and surged 75% for 2018. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 54.17% in the trailing four quarters.Lundin Mining Corp.  is another good pick, with a Zacks Rank #1. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 50% for the trailing four quarters. The earnings estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 5% for Lundin Mining over the last 30 days.However, we suggest staying away from or getting rid of stocks such Coeur Mining, Inc. (CDE  -  Free Report). Coeur Mining carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has a negative average earnings surprise of 283.33% for the trailing four quarters. Its estimates for 2017 have gone down to a loss per share of 5 cents from the prior estimate of earnings of 16 cents, over the last 30 days. The earnings estimate for 2018 has plunged 44% over the same time frame.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

947,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24.Last quarter, the mining company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.1% by posting adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents.Revenues went up around 15.2% year over year to $5,041 million, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,811.2 million.Notably, Freeport beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing the other two, with an average negative surprise of 1.4%.Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Freeport-McMoRan Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayFreeport, during fourth-quarter earnings call, stated that the company anticipates consolidated sales volumes for 2018 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 675,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first-quarter 2018.The company assumes average prices of $3.15 per pound of copper and $1,300 per ounce of gold for 2018. Notably, average realized prices for copper and gold were $3.21 per pound (up from $2.48 a year ago) and $1,285 per ounce (from $1,174 a year ago), respectively, in the fourth quarter. The company gained from higher copper prices in the last reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues is $4,760 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of around 42.5%. Meanwhile, consolidated copper production for the first quarter is expected to fall 2.6% from the prior quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 991 million pounds.Total copper sales from Freeport’s North American Copper Mines for the first quarter are projected to witness a 4.8% rise sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 371 million pounds. The segment’s sales volume decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades.  Total copper sales from the company’s South American Mining are expected to see a 2.6% decrease from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 304 million pounds.  Copper sales from Indonesia Mining are expected to fall around 10% on a sequential basis as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at 316 million pounds. However, gold sales from Indonesia Mining are projected to increase roughly 1% from last quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 590,000 ounces.Rising unit net cash costs for copper in Freeport’s North American operation is a concern. Unit net cash cost per pound of copper for North America increased from $1.41 in 2016 to $1.57 in 2017, and is expected to be roughly $1.67 per pound this year, mainly reflecting lower expected sales volumes. Also, the unit net costs for South American mines increased last year due to higher mining and milling costs at Cerro Verde and lower sales volumes.Nevertheless, Freeport should gain from favorable copper market conditions, its focus on productivity along with cost and capital discipline.Shares of Freeport have lost 3.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.9% decline. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Freeport for the first quarter is -6.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at 55 cents and 59 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.  Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.38% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

My perspective might be useful when the unthinkable is about to happen.
"
950,FCX,"It's All Relative
"
951,FCX,"This is the phrase I used to use to teach people about the world of currencies when I was an FX interbank market maker for ten years. In a world of spiraling debt and trade imbalances, the US dollar has seemed poised for an untimely death for most of that decade.
"
952,FCX,"The truth is that currencies of major economies generally don't go to zero, despite all the parallels you can draw between ancient Rome and the rise and fall of the US. What's more, the likelihood of American innovation, productivity, and wealth generation remaining on top of the world is much higher and more sustainable than most want to admit.
"
953,FCX,"Still, we have to answer hard questions about exploding debt, unfunded liabilities, runaway spending, and unbalanced budgets that turn deficits bigger than most other economies. I don't know how to balance the budget and call me somewhat cynical, but I doubt that anyone in Congress really cares to know more than he or she cares about power and the next election cycle.
"
954,FCX,"So, what can we know? In June of 2009, I wrote the following list for Greenfaucet.com in an piece titled ""Strong Dollar -- The Meaningless Debate."" This article and others like it were in response to prognosticators like Larry Kudlow, whom I admire and respect, pounding their fist that quantitative easing would be the death of ""king dollar."" The writing actually got me invited on his evening show that summer. I'll explain what happened in a moment.
"
955,FCX,"10 Reasons Not to Worry
"
956,FCX,"1) Little positive correlation between strong equities and strong dollar. In fact, it's often a negative correlation.
"
957,FCX,"2) ""King dollar"" was a harsh reality during 2008 credit crisis that took EUR back to $1.25, not a measure of growth. Dollar is still safe-haven of last resort when the defecation hits the rotary oscillator.
"
958,FCX,"3) Decades-long dollar depreciation reconvened in March 2009 with equity bottom and QE-fed commodity ""reflation.""
"
959,FCX,"4) China diversifying reserves is an old story whose time has come. Will get priced in slowly. No panic here.
"
960,FCX,"5) Bailouts, Deficits, Inflation-Oh My! Generational, systemic crisis needs quantitative easing, more than economy needs fiscal restraint.
"
961,FCX,"6) Global economy needs U.S. economic vitality more than U.S. needs a strong dollar.
"
962,FCX,"7) Can't have BRIC/EM growth without risk appetite in other major currencies. Can't have US growth without EM growth.
"
963,FCX,"8) Truth is that EU is in no better shape right now -- the euro is not going to $1.75, but if it did, we'll adapt quite well.
"
964,FCX,"9) Oil -- the other gold -- and commodities in general are the best inflation hedges, next to equities.
"
965,FCX,"10) US is not a perfect economy, just the best and only game in town.  It's all relative in a global economy of fiat currencies and wealth driven by productivity innovation.
"
966,FCX,"This is by no means a perfect or complete list of ""reasons not to worry"" about the dollar or the US AAA credit rating. It was just a collection of my dominant thoughts and arguments at the time two years ago. But you can see how many of the ideas persist as relevant and accurate.
"
967,FCX,"Dollar as Scorecard and Symptom
"
968,FCX,"In June of 2010, I expanded on these ideas in more detail as we enjoyed a strong dollar rally for most of the year, just as I predicted it would come back when Europe's PIIGs started flinging mud. My thesis about the dollar as ""scorecard and symptom"" was that it would continue to reflect both our vital importance to the global economy as well our obligations. I will reprint portions of that article, with the above title, next time.
"
969,FCX,"The balance between the dollar and other potential reserve currencies is wrought by the fact that few other places to put your money are as secure, even given all our money printing. This is why I say ""it's all relative.""
"
970,FCX,"And this is why you have to ask if it really makes any difference if the ratings agencies downgrade the US from AAA to AA this week or next. Who's really a AAA then? Should we all be graded on a curve?
"
971,FCX,"Wise investors have seen this coming for years. And as much as China won't like the risks and the impact upon global mood, they are probably also prepared for the worst if some investors should overreact to the downgrade. Right now, the markets in all risk assets are telling you that everything is going to be okay.
"
972,FCX,"See my ""Debt Ceiling Compromise is Small C"" for more perspective on the watchful eye of China and the unique symbiotic relationship our two economies share.
"
973,FCX,"A Philosophical Viewpoint, Grounded in Real Economic Experience
"
974,FCX,"There you have it. My amateur-economist view of the global economy, currency exchange rates, and sovereign debt. Take it with a grain of salt, or aspirin. Or ignore it completely for now. Just be willing to consider it at some point because I often know what I'm talking about as the list above from two years ago suggests. And I'm just trying to ease peoples' minds by talking about how the world really moves money and why.
"
975,FCX,"Sadly, they must have found a real economist for that Kudlow show because they bumped me off a few hours before. I know what you're thinking. ""Their loss,"" right? (I tell myself that Larry was afraid to have that debate with me, but I'm probably going too far now.)
"
976,FCX,"But controversy always seems to make better ""infotainment"" than excellent predictions. Maybe I need to be more controversial. I'm certainly not going back to school for my MBA, much less a PhD, at this point. The real world school of trading is much more profitable than any degree.

979,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX  -  Free Report) reported strong second quarter results on Thursday, surprising Wall Street expectations with net income of $1.37 billion, or non-GAAP EPS of $1.49 which bested the consensus of $1.34 by 15 cents. This was not only more than double the profit from the year-ago quarter, it was the fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise from the miner with the average beat for the past year running at 16% now.
"
980,FCX,"Revenues in the quarter surged 50% to $5.81 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $5.63 billion. Consolidated sales from mines totaled 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 356,000 ounces of gold and 21 million pounds of molybdenum compared with 914 million pounds of copper, 298,000 ounces of gold and 16 million pounds of molybdenum in the second quarter of 2010.
"
981,FCX,"Molybdenum is an element with an extremely high melting point and is thus valued in the production of high-strength steel alloys because it readily forms hard, stable carbides. Freeport is able to extract molybdenum from mineral deposits in an oxidized state before processing it.
"
982,FCX,"The Doctor Orders Profits
"
983,FCX,"In mid June I was highlighting the extreme buying opportunity I saw in Freeport below $50. My article ""Copper Stocks: Low-Risk Plays for Long-Term Trend"" had three interconnected themes:
"
984,FCX,"1) Copper demand from China and other Emerging Markets was still trending strong
"
985,FCX,"2) Copper was under priced near $4 per pound
"
986,FCX,"3) Freeport and other miners like Southern Copper (SCCO  -  Free Report) were a bargain trading below 10 times forward estimates
"
987,FCX,"Here's what I wrote then...
"
988,FCX,"""Copper, the industrial metal with a PhD in economics, may be a buy around $4 just from the looks of the chart alone. And when you consider that China and other emerging markets are not slowing down their rapid and massive urban development much, the demand picture looks like it should be consistently solid for years to come.""
"
989,FCX,"And here's a current chart of the good Doctor...
"
990,FCX,"You can clearly see that the rebound in risk appetite in late June that lifted equities also boosted commodities like copper. Also note how strong support was at $4 in June. Coincident with the good Doctor's rise, we saw a $9+ (20%), rally in FCX before their earnings report yesterday.
"
991,FCX,"A Billion Pounds, and $1,500 Gold, Give Good Guidance
"
992,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan's consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) are estimated to average $1.01 per pound of copper for 2011, sub $500 per ounce for gold, and $15 per pound for molybdenum for the second half of 2011. This is what company CFO Kathleen Quirk had to say about this quarter's sales and profit picture:
"
993,FCX,"""Our results in the second quarter included positive pricing of all of our key commodities: copper, gold and molybdenum. Our realized price for copper of $4.22 per pound was over $1 higher than the previous year's period. For gold, our price of $1,509 per ounce in the second quarter of 2011 was higher than last year's $1,234 per ounce realization, and our price of molybdenum of $18 per pound approximated the year-ago period.""
"
994,FCX,"A company like Freeport which does little forward hedging of gold, gets to reap the full benefits of the strong trend in the barbarous relic. And compared to most gold producers, they have one of the strongest balance sheets in the mining sector.
"
995,FCX,"If they sell another 350,000 ounces of gold in Q3 at an average price of $1,500 -- the company expects to sell 1.6 million ounces for the year -- that's over half a billion dollars in revenues. And assuming average prices of $4.25 per pound of copper and another billion pounds sold in Q3 and Q4 each, the company's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to exceed $8 billion for the year 2011.
"
996,FCX,"While EPS estimates have been trimmed back a bit since June to $5.98 for this year and $6.21 for 2012, this still represents a single digit forward P/E multiple. Clearly, the fortunes of both Dr. Copper and Freeport are tied to the pace of emerging markets growth. I'll address the warning shot fired by Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) about the global recovery at the end of this piece.

997,FCX,"Southern Profits On Deck
"
998,FCX,"The other copper stock I talked about buying last month near $30 -- especially for its 7% dividend -- has also done well in the past month. Southern Copper followed its Doctor's orders and looked strongly ""up and to the left"" with a nearly $6 surge. Another 20% winner on my copper call.
"
999,FCX,"In that article (linked above) I showed a Zacks Price & Consensus chart which is a great way to see how stock price tends to trend over time with changes in analyst estimates. I noted the steep pullback in SCCO from $50 to $30 on the leveling-off of earnings expectations. Here's what I said then...
"
1000,FCX,"""Southern Copper is another one ripe for upward earnings estimate revisions. If the mood about global growth picks up, you'll see the estimates for SCCO likely tick up too, which could move the name from a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) to a #2 Rank (buy).""
"
1001,FCX,"We haven't seen any upward revisions to earnings estimates yet. But the strong move back above $35 and Freeport's strength today in a quiet market bodes well for SCCO headed into its quarterly results next Friday July 29. Here's a snapshot of the Zacks data for Southern's earnings growth...
"
1002,FCX,"When the CAT Speaks on Global Growth...
"
1003,FCX,"Explaining its earnings miss today, even on record sales and revenues, Caterpillar executives spoke about the slower-than-expected pace of recovery in the second quarter, particularly due to the impacts of the Japan quake devastation.
"
1004,FCX,"But, the company also raised guidance for the second half of the year, noting that excluding the impact of the Bucyrus acquisition, they expect revenues in a range of $54 to $56 billion and earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.25, compared with the prior guidance of $52 to $54 billion of sales and revenues and earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.75.
"
1005,FCX,"CAT anticipates Bucyrus will have a negative impact of $0.50 per share on profit during the year. Thus is the price of becoming the largest maker of mining equipment in North America and if analysts were caught surprised by this, it will quickly sink in and be looked past.
"
1006,FCX,"Keep in mind that both the company and Wall Street analysts have an incentive to be conservative in their guidance and estimates, respectively. And the 6% profit-taking in CAT today is probably presenting buying opportunities for many who still believe in the global growth story as I do.
"
1007,FCX,"This optimism also bodes well for our copper stocks. Throughout the early quarters of the recovery in 2009, CAT CEO Jim Owens and his successor Doug Oberhelman were important ""prophets of profit"" as they described the strong global demand for construction and mining equipment coming from emerging markets. I recommended and bought many industrial, materials, and energy stocks in 2009 and 2010 based on their analysis of the global economy -- and CAT's rising earnings because of it.
"
1008,FCX,"In this way, Caterpillar was as much a solid forecasting economist as Dr. Copper. Thankfully, both are still looking up now.

1010,FCX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Freeport-McMoRan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.2. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Freeport-McMoRan’ current PE level puts it well below its highs over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Freeport-McMoRan has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 7.3 – considerably lower than the current level. So it is fair to say that a significantly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Freeport-McMoRan stock in the near term.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Freeport-McMoRan have a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Freeport-McMoRan currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Freeport-McMoRan a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Freeport-McMoRan might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives FCX a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the next year estimate has seen two upward and none downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current year consensus estimate has increased 2.2% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has moved higher by 2.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and Consensus Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and Consensus | Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Quote Even though the company has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineFreeport-McMoRan is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 11%), it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past three months, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below: So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

1011,FCX,"Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) have rallied 23.1% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 11.2%. Freeport, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $25.7 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months was around 19,502.8K.  Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this mining company.Driving FactorsForecast-topping fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance, progress in exploration activities to expand production capacity and efforts to reduce debt have contributed to the rally in Freeport’s shares.The company’s reported net income (attributable to common stock) jumped more than three-folds to 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter from 21 cents recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 51 cents a share also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents.Freeport’s results benefited from improving market conditions for copper, its focus on productivity along with cost and capital discipline. The company generated strong cash flows and continued to strengthen its balance sheet along with advancing several long-term projects.For 2018, Freeport believes that its shareholders are well positioned to benefit from its global leadership position in copper, high-quality portfolio of geographically diverse assets and favorable copper market conditions.The company anticipates consolidated sales volumes for 2018 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 675,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first-quarter 2018.Freeport is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity.Freeport’s actions to reduce debt should also boost its financial position. It has efficiently achieved its debt reduction objectives during 2016 and 2017 while retaining robust asset base for the future. During fourth-quarter 2017, the company repaid $1.7 billion debt and its total debt has also declined around 18.2% year over year to $13.1 billion at the end of 2017.Recently, Freeport issued notices to redeem $454 million total principal amount of Freeport and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC senior notes on Apr 4. The move will result in total cash interest cost savings worth $30 million per year.  Also, last month, Freeport’s board reinstated a cash dividend on its common stock and plans to declare a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share and expects an initial quarterly dividend to be paid on May 1. The move reflects Freeport’s execution of its plan to strengthen its financial position over the last two years. It is also driven by improved market conditions and a positive outlook for generating strong cash flows.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and Consensus Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

1013,FCX,"We now have quarterly results from 327 members of the S&P 500 Index, which makes up 71.2% of the Index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest status as of Nov 1, these companies have put a 7.8% increase in earnings driven by 6.5% higher sales on the scoreboard. Earnings growth rate for the members that have reported is lower than growth reported by the same group in the second quarter but is in line with its four-quarter average.Around 74.9% of these companies delivered positive earnings surprises while 65.7% surpassed revenue expectations. (Read more: All-time Record Earnings in Q3)Taking into account all the S&P members that are yet to disclose their numbers, total earnings for the Index are expected to be up 5.6% year over year on a 5.5% increase in revenues in the third quarter. This marks a deceleration from the 11.2% increase in earnings in the second quarter and 13.6% in the first. Despite lower growth projections, total earnings in dollar amount will likely hit all-time quarterly record in the third quarter.Further, earnings growth graph will eventually pick up fourth quarter onwards as evident from our projections. Earnings growth will be 7.3% in fourth-quarter 2017, 9.3% in first-quarter 2018, 9.2% in the second and 10.8% in third-quarter 2018. Consequently, these quarters are set to break the expected record levels in the third quarter in dollar terms.  Overall for 2017, total earnings for the S&P 500 Index will go up 7.1% on 4.7% higher revenues, a marked improvement from the 0.7% earnings growth on 2.2% higher revenues delivered in 2016.The Basic Materials sector, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, has reported earnings growth of 8% in the quarter so far. Around 68% of the S&P 500 members have reported their results. However, taking into account all the S&P 500 members that are yet to report, the sector will lose its momentum. Per projections, it will finish with a decline of 2.3% despite a 10.7% rise in earnings. The mining stocks fall under the Basic Material sector.Gold gained 5% in the third quarter. Gains from a weaker US dollar and geopolitical tensions between the United States and North Korea were the main highlights. The Fed also drove gold prices during the quarter. Copper has also been on a high as supply disruptions at some of the key copper mines including BHP Billiton Limited’s (BHP  -  Free Report) Escondida mine (the world's biggest copper mine) in Chile earlier this year and a strike at Freeport-McMoRan Inc.'s (FCX  -  Free Report) Grasberg operations in Indonesia led to a decline in mined copper production and provided a thrust to prices. Further, reports of a potential Chinese ban on certain imports of copper scrap by the end of 2018 as part of the country’s move to reduce waste helped prop prices. This would lead to higher demand for refined copper and copper concentrate.While China’s imports of copper scrap improved this year, the country’s demand for refined copper remains depressed. As such, a ban on scrap would result in increased imports of refined copper. In fact, the non-ferrous metal is among the best performing commodities this year.In this write-up, we take a sneak peek into three mining stocks that are slated to report their third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 6.Gold-focused royalty and stream company in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Africa, Franco-Nevada Corporation (FNV  -  Free Report), will report financial results before the market opens. The company’s earnings have surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while posting in-line earnings in one. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 13.4%.Franco-Nevada Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Franco-Nevada Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Franco-Nevada Corporation QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show that Franco-Nevada is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is 26 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 27 cents. Franco-Nevada currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Franco-Nevada expects to meet the top end of its previously announced production guidance range of 470,000-500,000 gold equivalent ounces(or GEOs) for 2017. The company anticipates its various stream agreements to contribute 335,000-345,000 GEOs in 2017, out of the total. Revenues from oil & gas assets are expected in the band of $35-$45 million.U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (SLCA  -  Free Report), which produces and sells commercial silica in the United States, will report quarterly numbers after the closing bell. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, resulting in a positive average earnings surprise of 23.57%.U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. QuoteEarlier we had expected the company to deliver an earnings beat as it had an ESP of +2.73%, but the scenario has changed with the current ESP of +0.00%. U.S. Silica Holdings has an ESP of +0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and  the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 49 cents . The combination of U.S. Silica Holdings’ Earnings ESP of 0.00% and Zacks Rank #3 makes earnings prediction difficult. (Read more: Is a Beat in Store for U.S. Silica in Q3 Earnings?)Revenues for the company’s Oil & Gas division for the third quarter is projected to increase roughly 14.9% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $270 million. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial and Specialty Products division’s revenues is expected to be $57 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 3.6% growth on a sequential-comparison basis.However, inconsistent demand for sand led to lower-than-expected sand volumes in the second quarter and remains a headwind for the company in third-quarter 2017.Tahoe Resources Inc. (TAHO  -  Free Report) primarily produces copper, gold, silver, lead/zinc, and natural gas and petroleum, as well as precious metals assets.The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in a positive average earnings surprise of 28.7%.Tahoe Resources, Inc.

Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced have been revised downward. Total cash cost estimates have been decreased by $50 per ounce to an estimated $650-$700 per ounce, reflecting the higher anticipated production levels and better-than-anticipated cost performance year to date.  All-in sustaining costs have decreased by $100 per ounce to a guidance range of $1,050-$1,150 per ounce, driven by higher production and lower capital and exploration costs.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Copper sales volumes were lower than the year-ago figure, which mainly reflects lower ore grades in Indonesia and North America and the timing of shipments. In contrast, gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia.According to the company, focus on cost management along with free cash flow generation has enabled it to strengthen balance sheet and successfully execute strategies.

1016,FCX,"Investors in Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 27, 2017 $16.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Freeport-McMoRan shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Freeport-McMoRan is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Mining - Non Ferrous industry that ranks in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 25 cents per share to 29 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Freeport-McMoRan right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Copper sales volumes were lower than the year-ago figure of 1.1 billion, which mainly reflects lower sales volume at Cerro Verde and in North America. Gold sales also fell year over year mainly reflecting lower mill rates at PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI).According to Freeport, during 2017 the company benefited from improved market conditions for copper, focus on productivity and cost and capital discipline.Full-Year 2017Freeport reported earnings of $1.25 per share for full-year 2017, as against loss of $3.16 per share reported year ago. Sales increased 10.6% year over year to $16,403 million in 2017.Operational UpdateConsolidated average unit net cash costs of $1.04 per pound of copper were lower from $1.21 reported in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to higher by-product credits, which were partly offset higher mining and milling costs and lower copper sales volumes in South America.Average realized price for copper was $3.21 per pound, up from $2.48 a year ago. Average realized price per ounce for gold rose to $1,285 in the quarter from $1,174 a year ago, while average realized price per pound for molybdenum was $9.79 per pound.Mining UpdateNorth America Copper Mines: Copper sales decreased 14.9% year over year to 354 million pounds mainly due to expected lower ore grades.

1110,FCX,"Investors in Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb 2, 2018 $14.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Freeport-McMoRan shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Freeport-McMoRan is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Mining - Non Ferrous industry that ranks in the Bottom 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 53 cents per share to 55 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Freeport-McMoRan right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

"
1135,FCX,"Materials and Energy expected to see massive year-over-year declines
"
1136,FCX,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with almost 40% of the reports in. While in this report we have not tracked revenues, there seems to be a general pattern where the source of the positive surprises is coming from much better-than-expected margins (both operating and net) rather than from better-than-expected revenue growth. In other words companies are succeeding in cost cutting their way, if not to prosperity, then at least much better than feared results.
"
1137,FCX,"While, at the individual company level, this is almost always a positive, it is not necessarily so at the macro level. Cutting costs by reducing head count means that there are fewer jobs and less overall demand in the economy. Still, given the weak state of the economy, I suspect most investors will not be too picky about the source of the earnings improvements.
"
1138,FCX,"The one exception to this might be in the financials, where the earnings quality is weak due to FASB caving to political pressure and doing away with mark to market accounting. On the other hand, I have not seen any situations of massive mark-to-market of the liabilities but not the assets like we saw in the first quarter.
"
1139,FCX,"The total earnings reported so far is $78.9 billion, a decline of 16.1% from the $94.0 billion the same 198 firms reported a year ago. However, on a sequential basis earnings are up 7.1% from the first quarter pace. Actual earnings growth has been a pretty rare commodity with only 63 firms actually posting higher net income than a year ago.
"
1140,FCX,"The median EPS growth rate is a negative 17.3%. (Those still left to report have a median expected EPS growth rate of -13.7%.) While the median EPS growth reported is largely in line with the total net income decline, there is a big difference when it comes to those yet to report.
"
1141,FCX,"The total net income of the remaining firms is expected to plunge 40.3%, which is far worse than what we have seen so far, as well as very different from the median. The big decline in total net income for the remaining firms may be in part due to the mix of firms that have reported, with a very small percentage of the total energy earnings in yet (20% of Energy firms have reported, but none of the big guys that represent the bulk of the earnings in the sector). On the other hand it means that the bar is set very low for the remaining firms and we may well see more positive earnings surprises.
"
1142,FCX,"Keep in mind that medians are inherently equally weighted with the growth rate of a relatively small firm counting as much as that of an Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) or a Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). Also changes in share count can affect EPS growth, but not total net income growth.

"
1157,FCX,"So far, this is looking like the story of the dog that didn't bark. Yes, the revisions ratio has edged up, but given the magnitude and number of positive surprises in second quarter earnings, one would expect a flood of positive estimate revisions.
"
1158,FCX,"After all the second quarter is part of the full year 2009, so if a company beats the estimates for the quarter, and the analysts do not raise their estimates for the full year by the amount of the beat, then they are implicitly cutting their forecasts for the third and fourth quarters. There is a very good possibility that this is simply a lag effect in the data, as the pace of reports has really picked up in the last few days. If so we should see the revisions ratios rise dramatically over the next few weeks. If not, it will be a subtle, but very disturbing sign.
"
1159,FCX,"The defensive Staples and Health Care sectors are doing the best on the revision front. However, Materials is about as cyclical a sector as you can think of and it has shown a great improvement in its revisions ratio, apparently in response to the much better-than-expected earnings in the sector. Utilities are the weakest sector, followed by the very small Telecom sector. No Utilities have reported yet and only one Telecom company (AT&T (T  -  Free Report)) has reported.
"
1160,FCX,"In the Staples and Health Care sectors, analysts generally tend to be in tight agreement about the expected earnings (small standard deviation around the mean estimate). They, therefore, will not show up on screens of the biggest estimate revisions. On the other hand it means that even small changes in the mean estimate can be significant, and it is best to look for large numbers of analysts changing their estimates in one direction, rather than for big changes in the mean estimate.
"
1161,FCX,"In Health Care, the big drug companies stand out in this regard. Among the notables are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Schering-Plough (SGP). The same is true for the staples, where some of the stocks with large numbers of estimate increases include Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Colgate Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report).
"
1162,FCX,"The Materials sector is much more prone to big changes in earnings estimates. There, Freeport-Mcmoran (FCX  -  Free Report) was a real stand out with its mean estimate for 2009 leaping by over 80% in the last four weeks.

"
1178,FCX,"Neil Malkin contributed significantly to this report.
"
1179,FCX,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 7/23/2009
"
1180,FCX,"Despite the significant equity market rally off the March lows and the talk of ""green shoots,"" we still see a challenging global economic backdrop and a less than robust environment for the Machinery sector. In fact, what we have seen is certain economies stabilize at much lower levels from peak cycle activity, rather than any sort of V-shaped recovery.
"
1181,FCX,"As foreign economies deal with weaker exports to the U.S and Europe, industrial customers are cutting back on capital spending. On a y-o-y basis, equipment orders continue to decelerate in almost every end-market -- from machines used in construction, infrastructure, and agriculture. On the bright side, production cuts have helped reduce inventory levels. As a result, we should see less of a near-term drag on output.
"
1182,FCX,"But lets not confuse a potential inventory rebuild and fiscal stimulus with a real, sustained U.S consumer-led recovery. The combination of U.S job cuts, minimal income growth and less consumer credit availability tells us that global exporting countries must try to stimulate their own domestic demand.
"
1183,FCX,"Before getting into some global data points, we believe that most of positive industrial news headlines are the result of sequential data comparisons rather than y-o-y comps.  From peak levels, the data looks less than inspiring.
"
1184,FCX,"There are several data points that help to paint the picture of a weak global industrial backdrop. Japan's core machine orders fell 1.3% in April from March levels, but on a y-o-y basis orders fell 22.2%. Orders have fallen in 10 of the last 15 months. What's more, according to the cabinet office in Japan, overseas orders fell 48.7%. Japanese machine orders are still far below 2008 levels, and have yet to recover to 2004-2007 levels.
"
1185,FCX,"Furthermore, a manufacturing survey conducted by the cabinet office indicated second quarter core orders would decline 5% from the prior quarter. We agree with this assessment. We would not be surprised to see core orders decline in each quarter of 2009. Also, in April, Japanese industrial production increased 5.2%. However, on a y-o-y basis, output is down 34%. Again, it is easy to get a decent sized month-to-month bounce from severely depressed levels.
"
1186,FCX,"Also, according to the VDMA machine makers association, German plant and machinery orders fell a record 58% in April compared to the same period a year ago, with export orders down 60% and domestic demand down 52%.  The Industrial weakness went well beyond German borders. Italy saw March output decline 23.8%, Spain -24.7%, Luxembourg -29.6%, and Estonia -29.7%. In fact, the whole euro region saw March industrial production fall 20.2%. The chart below (source: ECB statistical data warehouse) shows the industrial production decline for the Euro area 16 takes it back to 1998-1999 levels.
"
1187,FCX,"The domestic picture appears to be no brighter. According to Zacks Director of Equity Research Dirk Van Dijk, CFA, total industrial production fell 0.5% in April, following a decline of 1.7% in March and a decline of 1.4% in February. On a year-over-year basis, total industrial output is down 12.5%, and is 16.0% below its peak. Manufacturing output fell 0.3% on the month following a 2.1% decline in March (revised from -1.7%), and was down 14.5%.
"
1188,FCX,"Output from the nation's mines tumbled 3.2% following a 2.6% decline in March, and is 8.6% below year-ago levels. In contrast, Utility output rose 0.4% on the month following a 1.9% rise in March and is down just 3.2% from a year ago. Overall capacity dropped to yet another all-time record low of 69.1% from 69.4% in March (revised from 69.3%). A year ago, overall capacity utilization was 79.2%.
"
1189,FCX,"The year-ago level was about normal. In an economic boom, Dirk Van Dijk points out that capacity utilization gets up to about 85%, and historically a level of 75% indicates a very severe recession. We are in uncharted territory.
"
1190,FCX,"When looking at the global macro backdrop for industrial production and machinery orders amid weaker U.S consumption, we expect a continued slowdown in capital spending.
"
1191,FCX,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
1192,FCX,"While the credit crunch and slower economic growth dampens private sector spending, fiscal expenditures appear ready to play a counter-cyclical role. China announced a rather large stimulus package in November.
"
1193,FCX,"Also, the U.S Congress passed a stimulus package that President Obama signed on Tuesday, February 17, 2009. The bill contains money that will flow into infrastructure spending. The only issue is the timeframe of the spending. For example, according to CBO estimates, of the $27.5 billion in the budget for highway spending (Title XII - Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Highway Construction), $9.625 billion will be spent by the end of FY2010. This equates to 35% in the first two (FY) years and the remaining portion realized through the (FY) years 2011-2016.
"
1194,FCX,"Amid the current global economic slowdown, there may be a silver lining. Central bankers have gone from raising interest rates and fighting inflation to slashing rates and flooding the system with liquidity. Specifically, the U.S Federal Reserve has engaged in quantitative easing (QE). In March, the FED announced it would spend over $1 trillion to buy mortgages-backed securities, agency debt and Treasury securities. In our view, these monetary conditions have helped to put a bid into commodity prices. We would become more constructive on commodity stocks, such as Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), on signs reflation measures were sustainable into 2010.
"
1195,FCX,"WEAKNESSES
"
1196,FCX,"We remain cautious on the U.S residential construction (& related) space. In our view, there is still too much existing and new home inventory to justify a new up-cycle in starts, which partially impacts the order flow of machinery companies that sell or lease equipment to the homebuilders. On the demand side, the combination of a weaker U.S labor market and the recent rise in mortgage rates (although from historically low levels) does not appear to add to the pool of available homebuyers.
"
1197,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 25.Last quarter, the mining company reported a negative earnings surprise of 15%. Freeport missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 20.1%.Freeport’s shares have moved up 14.4% in the last three months, underperforming the 16.6% growth recorded by its industry.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFreeport, in July, cut its sales volume expectations for 2017. The company now sees sales volumes to be roughly 3.7 billion pounds of copper (down from 3.9 billion pounds expected earlier), 1.6 million ounces of gold (down from 1.9 million ounces expected earlier) and 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 940 million pounds of copper, 375,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in third-quarter 2017.The company assumes average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold, $2.65 per pound of copper and $7.50 per pound of molybdenum for the remainder of 2017.The company’s consolidated copper sales volumes in the second quarter were lower than its expectations reflecting the impact of worker absenteeism on mining and milling rates in Indonesia. However, gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia. Copper sales from Freeport’s North American Copper Mines for the third quarter is projected to witness a 13.5% decrease from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 353 million pounds. The segment’s sales volume also decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.Gold sales from the Indonesia  Mining for the third quarter is projected to decline 11.9% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 376,000 ounces.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for copper sales from the company’s South America Mining is expected to be 315 million pounds for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 8.9% growth on a sequential-comparison basis. The company’s sales were affected in the second quarter due to reduced mining rates, ore grades and recoveries.Freeport is taking actions to cut mining costs and reduce debt. It is also conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity. The company’s copper cash costs declined roughly 10% year over year in the second quarter. Freeport’s cost reduction actions should lend support to its margins in the third quarter.The company is also expected to gain from higher copper prices in the to-be-reported quarter, providing support to its top line. Copper prices have enjoyed a healthy run so far in 2017.However, Freeport has cut its copper and gold sales volume guidance for 2017, partly due to the impact of the suspension of exports in Indonesia. Freeport reduced its Indonesia workforce by 10% and cut investments in the Grasberg underground expansion to make up for the losses suffered due to the halt of export. Nevertheless, Freeport and the government of Indonesia have agreed on a framework that would allow Freeport to keep operating its Grasberg mine.Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Freeport for the third quarter is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 30 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.

1198,FCX,"Investors in Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the September 1st, 2017 $13.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Freeport-McMoRan shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Freeport-McMoRan is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Mining - Non Ferrous industry that ranks in the Bottom 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 28 cents per share to 23 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Freeport-McMoRan right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1199,FCX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Freeport-McMoran, Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Freeport’s Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat EstimatesFreeport reported net income (attributable to common stock) of $0.18 per share for second-quarter 2017, as against the year-ago loss of $0.38. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings were $0.17 a share in the second quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20. Revenues went up around 11.3% year over year to $3,711 million in the reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,678 million. Consolidated sales from mines totaled 942 million pounds of copper, 432,000 ounces of gold and 25 million pounds of molybdenum for the reported quarter. Copper sales volumes were lower than the company’s expectations reflecting the impact of worker absenteeism on mining and milling rates in Indonesia. Gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia.Operational UpdateConsolidated average unit net cash costs declined to $1.20 per pound of copper from $1.33 in the year-ago quarter. This is mainly attributable to higher by-product credits, partly offset by reduced copper sales volumesAverage realized price per ounce for gold rose to $1,243 in the quarter from $1,292 a year ago, while average realized price per pound for molybdenum was $9.58 per pound.Mining UpdateNorth America Copper Mines: Copper sales decreased 12.1% year over year to 408 million pounds mainly due to lower ore grades. Production fell 18.1% year over year to 384 million pounds in the reported quarter.Freeport expects copper sales from North America to be 1.5 billion pounds in 2017, compared with the year-ago figure of 1.8 billion pounds. South America Mining: Copper sales of 287 million pounds declined 12.2% from the year-ago quarter owing to reduced mining rates, ore grades and recoveries. South America mining is anticipated to report sales of around 1.2 billion pounds of copper in 2017, compared with sales of 1.3 billion pounds in 2016. Indonesia Mining: Copper sales of 247 million pounds improved 26% from 196 million pounds the year-ago quarter. The results reflect the sale of concentrate in inventory and increased ore grades, partly offset by reduced mill rates. Gold sales surged 182.8% to 427,000 ounces and production rose 120.2% year over year to 348,000 ounces in the reported quarter. Sales from Indonesia mining are anticipated to be about 1 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold for 2017. Molybdenum Mines: Molybdenum production was 8 million pounds in the second quarter compared with 7 million pounds in the year-ago quarter. Financial Position Freeport had operating cash flows of roughly $1 billion in the quarter, which includes $144 million in working capital and changes in other tax payments. Freeport had total debt of $15,354 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down from $19,220 million as of Jun 30, 2016. Guidance Freeport anticipates sales volumes for the year 2017 to be roughly 3.7 billion pounds of copper (down from 3.9 billion pounds expected earlier), 1.6 million ounces of gold (down from 1.9 million ounces expected earlier) and 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 940 million pounds of copper, 375,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in third-quarter 2017. The company assumes average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold, $2.65 per pound of copper and $7.50 per pound of molybdenum for the remainder of 2017. Consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for copper mines are expected to average $1.19 per pound of copper for 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

1201,FCX,"Industrial metals’ stocks have been the star performers this month on signs of rising demand in China and a weak dollar. China is growing faster than expected with its GDP expanding 6.9% in the second quarter. This was well above analysts' expectations of a 6.8% expansion. With this, we can say that China is on track to comfortably to meet it’s this year growth target of 6.5% (read: China Q2 GDP Beats Expectations: ETFs in Focus).Robust growth came on the heels of strong industrial production, recovering exports, low inventory, government infrastructure spending spree, robust retail sales and a strengthening housing market. This has infused huge confidence in the world’s second-largest economy thereby pushing the metals higher. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar slumped to 13-month low against a basket of currencies on the Fed’s dovish stance and soft data on inflation and consumer spending. A weak dollar has made dollar-denominated assets cheap for foreign investors and has thus raised the appeal for metals.In particular, copper producers have been leading the way higher in the anticipation of reduced imports of refined copper from the world’s top metal user. This is especially true as China is seeking to curb some imports of machinery waste and other products for the purpose of extracting metals scrap from year-end 2018. This would disrupt the supply of the red metal while push up demand for imported refined copper, leading to higher prices. Notably, about half of the world’s copper demand comes from China.As a result, Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX  -  Free Report) topped the list of the best performing ETFs of July, delivering solid returns of about 17.1% (see: all the Materials ETFs here).Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of COPX:COPX in FocusThis product provides global access to a broad range of copper mining companies by tracking the Solactive Global Copper Miners Total Return Index.

"
1204,FCX,"Commodity prices have been soaring. Oil, gold, copper, wheat and corn all recently hit multi-month highs. Even the Duke Brothers are making a mint on orange juice futures.
"
1205,FCX,"A steady stream of economic data showing a slower pace of deterioration in the U.S. has been the primary driver behind the recent surge. Also playing a role is the combination of a higher tolerance for risk, weekly fluctuations in inventories, the spring planting season, the dollar and sustained growth in China.
"
1206,FCX,"What's interesting about the rally is that it has yet to translate into higher earnings estimates for commodity-related companies.
"
1207,FCX,"Agriculture Companies
"
1208,FCX,"Wheat and corn futures recently set 8-month highs. Other agricultural-related futures have also soared, such as coffee. Profit forecasts for agricultural companies, however, have been trending lower.
"
1209,FCX,"There are 2 reasons for the disconnect.
"
1210,FCX,"The first is the credit crisis. Though the Treasury Department has deemed some banks too big to fail, many smaller banks have been seized. This has created big problems for some rural communities that depend on just 1 or 2 banks. Furthermore, tighter credit conditions have made it harder for farmers to get the financing they need for planting season.
"
1211,FCX,"The second is the weather. Cool and wet weather systems delayed the planting of crops such as corn and soybeans. Monsanto (MON) recently blamed the weather for hurting herbicide sales and causing it to lower full-year guidance. Obviously, the late planting season also has implications for fertilizer companies such as Agrium (AGU).
"
1212,FCX,"One glimmer of light, however, is Potash of Saskatchewan (POT). Two analysts recently raised their full-year forecasts. The changes were not enough to move the consensus earnings estimate, but they were a step in the right direction.
"
1213,FCX,"MON is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stock and is classified in Agricultural Operations. AGU and POT are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks and are classified in Fertilizers.
"
1214,FCX,"Metal Stocks
"
1215,FCX,"Since January, gold has consistently stayed above $860 per ounce. After pulling back in April, the precious metal is once again nearing the $1,000 mark.
"
1216,FCX,"Gold mining stocks have also rallied lately, though profit forecasts remain unchanged. In fact, the number of positive and negative revisions is about even for Mining-Gold. This was essentially the same scenario we saw in February.
"
1217,FCX,"The lack of changes reflect a combination of uncertainty about where gold prices are headed, the impact of other metals on mining company profits (e.g. zinc has hurt profits for Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM  -  Free Report)) and lower production levels.
"
1218,FCX,"For other metals, the economy is the big issue. The worldwide recession has led to lower demand. Though optimism about a forthcoming recovery has helped send copper prices and other metals higher, the rise has not translated into better profit forecasts. Rather, the consensus estimates for AK Steel (AKS), Alcoa (AA) and other metal producers are holding steady or declining.
"
1219,FCX,"One notable exception is Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report). Within the past month, positive revisions have pushed the full-year consensus earnings estimate 2 cents higher to $1.02 per share.
"
1220,FCX,"AEM, AKS, AA and FCX are Zacks #3 Rank stocks. AEM is classified in Mining-Gold. AKS is classified in Steel-Producers. AA and FCX are classified in Mining-Non Ferrous.
"
1221,FCX,"Oil & Gas Companies
"
1222,FCX,"Most of the profit forecast changes occurring among energy stock prices are in reaction to better-than-feared first-quarter earnings, not an improved outlook for commodity prices.
"
1223,FCX,"Natural gas is a big reason why. Even with the recent rally, natural gas prices are down considerably for the year. As a result, companies like Apache (APA  -  Free Report) are focused on controlling costs. Furthermore, they are only expanding to the extent that cash flows allow them to. Though this helps the bottom line, we have yet to see analysts truly adjust their forecasts to account for the higher commodity prices.
"
1224,FCX,"After last year, it's not hard to blame brokerage analysts for being a bit cautious. During the first-half of 2008, they underestimated how high crude would climb. After the bubble peaked in July, many brokerage analysts incorrectly judged how quickly energy prices would plunge.
"
1225,FCX,"Our energy analyst, Sheraz Mian, advocates looking at oilfield service companies as a way to play the rise in energy prices. Among the stocks he has long-term buy ratings on are Weatherford (WFT  -  Free Report) and Ensco (ESV).
"
1226,FCX,"APA, WFT and ESV are Zacks #3 Rank stocks. APA is classified in Oil-U.S. Exploration & Production. WFT is classified in Oil Field Machine & Equipment. ESV is classified in Oil & Gas Drilling.
"
1227,FCX,"Commodity-Related Stocks Now Riskier
"
1228,FCX,"The lack of positive revisions implies that the risk of owning commodity-related stocks is high.
"
1229,FCX,"Valuations have increased notably as the higher stock prices have not been matched by a better earnings outlook. At the same time, commodities have staged a strong rally and it's hard to say how much upside is left. Though agriculture commodities may be influenced by the late planting season, energy and metal futures may need actual signs of higher demand to extend their rally.

1249,FCX,"The 4th quarter earnings season is now in full swing. It is still on the early side, with just 81, or 16.2%, of the S&P 500 reports in. However, history does suggest that by the time you have about 15% of the sample, you can have a pretty good feel for how the rest of the earning season will go.

The early median surprise of 6.56% is also quite strong, although the ratio of positive to negative surprises is only somewhat above normal at just 3.69.

The expectations are that the remaining 419 of the S&P 500 firms will post total net income that is just 12.26% than a year ago. That is a slowdown from the year over year growth of the third quarter (20.2%).
"
1252,FCX,"The firms that have reported are somewhat bigger/more profitable than those that have yet to report, on average. If all the remaining firms were to report exactly as expected, then 27.4% of the total earnings expected for the quarter are in. The implied total growth is 23.4%. Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, one does not need an overly active imagination to envision that growth will be over to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter.Revenue Growth Expected to Fall
"
1253,FCX,"Revenue growth, though, is expected to slow down significantly, actually falling 0.33% from positive growth of 9.01% in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among those companies that have reported is very healthy at 7.54%.
"
1254,FCX,"The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. They are also somewhat over-represented in the early going, responsible for 34.8% of all the net income reported so far. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 2.50% year over year from 8.85%.
"
1255,FCX,"Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story. However, as I mentioned above, revenue surprises have been quite strong so far, with a median revenue surprise of 1.50%.Net Margin Expansion
"
1256,FCX,"Thus the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the financials, where the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different.
"
1257,FCX,"Much of the earnings growth in the financials has come from firms setting aside less for bad debts than they did last year. One should be a bit on the doubtful side about the quality of those earnings, particularly in the absence of mark-to-market accounting.
"
1258,FCX,"Among those that have reported, net margins are 11.97%, or 11.56% if one excludes the financials, up from 7.88% (9.93% excluding financials) a year ago, and 11.71% (10.69% excluding financials) in the third quarter. The expected net margin for the remainder is 8.12% (7.72% excluding financials) up from 7.21% (7.56% ex-financials) last year.
"
1259,FCX,"Net margins continue to march northward on a yearly basis. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.42% in 2009. They are expected to hit 8.80% in 2010 and continue climbing to 9.68% in 2011 and 10.19% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession if the financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.13% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and are expected to be 8.25% in 2010, 8.93% in 2011 and 9.36% in 2012.
"
1260,FCX,"Full-Year Expectations and Beyond
"
1261,FCX,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $782.6 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $907.0 billion, or increases of 43.2% and 15.9%, respectively.
"
1262,FCX,"The early expectation is for 2012 to have total net income of just over the $1 Trillion mark. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $105.81. That is up from $57.67 for 2009, $82.60 for 2010, and $95.54 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.45%, a P/E of 15.5x based on 2010 and 13.4x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.
"
1263,FCX,"With almost two 2011 estimates being raised for each one being cut (revisions ratio of 1.91), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher.Historical/Political Factors
"
1264,FCX,"The bullish argument is further boosted by such historical factors such as being in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four) and having a Democrat in the White House and the GOP at least partially in charge at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave. While there is not a huge sample size of years with that political alignment, those that exist were very good ones for the stock market.
"
1265,FCX,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling.
"
1266,FCX,"If the debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. government would go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the government would probably have to shut down. That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. And while it is inconceivable that a higher debt ceiling will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.The (Slow) Road to Recovery
"
1267,FCX,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor and are a major reason behind the strong earnings growth.
"
1268,FCX,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 15.9% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved.
"
1269,FCX,"Growth of 15.9% is not exactly awful. Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 5.36%, or 6.09% if one excludes the financial sector, is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.
"
1270,FCX,"Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 81 of S&P 500 firms (16.2%) have reported, but that is a big enough sample to suggest this will be another strong earnings season.Off to a good start with a median surprise of 6.56%, and a 3.69 surprise ratio (59 beats, 16 misses), 72.8% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 68, falling EPS for 13 firms -- a 5.23 ratio, 84.0% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 63.3% among those that have reported.Six sectors have only a single report in, pay attention to the percent reported when evaluating sector data.
"
1271,FCX,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on, the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction - to +   9.09% 466.67 1 0 1 0Medical 17.77% 6.38% 33.63 3 0 3 0Conglomerates 17.28% 10.00% 12.50 1 0 1 0Basic Materials 57.03% 26.09% 10.57 6 0 6 0Oils and Energy 42.47% 2.63% 10.39 1 0 1 0Aerospace 25.83% 10.00% 10.34 1 0 1 0Computer and Tech 37.59% 22.86% 9.86 14 1 15 1Consumer Discretionary 16.03% 12.12% 8.93 3 1 3 1Industrial Products 73.33% 10.00% 7.51 2 0 1 1Business Service 6.35% 5.26% 5.71 1 0 1 0Finance 201.90% 33.33% 3.84 17 7 21 5Retail/Wholesale 13.31% 24.44% 2.90 6 4 9 2Auto 30.21% 16.67% 1.85 1 0 1 0Consumer Staples -2.98% 7.89% 0.00 1 1 1 2Transportation 20.93% 33.33% 0.00 1 1 2 1Utilities 6.91% 2.33% -2.86 0 1 1 0S&P 63.29% 16.20% 6.56 59 16 68 13Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 3.47, median surprise 1.499% -- a very strong showing; 72.8% of all firms do better than expected on top line.Growing Revenues outnumber falling revenues by ratio of 2.52, 71.6% of firms have higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth very healthy at 7.54% but still greatly lags earnings growth, pointing to net margin expansion (see net margin tables below).

1278,FCX,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
1279,FCX,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstAk Steel Hldg AKS 18.23% -0.95% 0.27 0.00 25.44 12.22Utd States Stl X 16.24% 3.89% 0.55 0.25 18.84 11.29Jabil Circuit JBL 14.49% 12.75% 1.00 0.88 10.90 9.38Alcoa Inc AA 12.93% 10.84% 0.31 0.27 13.19 10.61Freept Mc Cop-B FCX 11.62% 16.27% 0.53 0.33 10.29 9.98Murphy Oil MUR 9.27% 4.87% 0.50 0.25 11.74 10.90Newmont Mining NEM 8.75% 10.57% 0.41 0.21 11.10 11.11Adobe Systems ADBE 7.94% 8.30% 1.00 0.50 17.41 15.24Marathon Oil Cp MRO 7.35% 2.60% 0.50 0.29 9.21 8.39Consol Energy CNX 6.77% -0.04% 0.48 0.00 17.01 11.15Nvidia Corp NVDA 6.68% 18.78% 0.42 0.59 38.97 27.15Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 6.56% 8.73% 0.26 0.22 47.29 36.35Anadarko Petrol APC 6.36% -2.10% 0.21 0.21 36.22 24.51Massey Egy Cpy MEE 6.33% 12.56% 0.10 0.37 15.23 10.83Apollo Group APOL 5.61% -1.16% 0.70 -0.18 9.13 9.47Motorola Solutn MSI 5.30% -15.00% 0.33 0.17 12.67 10.86Oracle Corp ORCL 5.27% 4.89% 0.94 0.93 15.60 14.02Hess Corp HES 5.21% 11.52% 0.29 0.08 13.00 11.39

1281,FCX,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, but because not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report.

"
1292,FCX,"Though it currently has a short-term Zacks #3 Rank ('hold'), FCX has a long-term recommendation of ""Outperform"". We believe that market conditions for copper will remain favorable for the next couple of years, due to higher consumption of metals in the emerging economies.

Copper sales volumes were lower than the company’s expectations reflecting the impact of worker absenteeism on mining and milling rates in Indonesia. Gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia. Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Freeport-McMoran, Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateConsolidated average unit net cash costs declined to $1.20 per pound of copper from $1.33 in the year-ago quarter.

The results reflect the sale of concentrate in inventory and increased ore grades, partly offset by reduced mill rates. Gold sales surged 182.8% to 427,000 ounces and production rose 120.2% year over year to 348,000 ounces in the reported quarter. Sales from Indonesia mining are anticipated to be about 1 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold for 2017. Molybdenum Mines: Molybdenum production was 8 million pounds in the second quarter compared with 7 million pounds in the year-ago quarter. Financial Position Freeport had operating cash flows of roughly $1 billion in the quarter, which includes $144 million in working capital and changes in other tax payments. Freeport had total debt of $15,354 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down from $19,220 million as of Jun 30, 2016. Guidance Freeport anticipates sales volumes for the year 2017 to be roughly 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces of gold and 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 940 million pounds of copper, 375,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in third-quarter 2017.  The company assumes average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold, $2.65 per pound of copper and $7.50 per pound of molybdenum for the remainder of 2017. Consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for copper mines are expected to average $1.19 per pound of copper for 2017.  Price Performance Freeport’s shares have moved up 2.2% in the last one year, underperforming the industry’s 14.2% gain.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked companies in the basic materials space include The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), Arkema S.A.

1329,FCX,"The recent rally in gold is nothing new. Gold is the only asset class that has moved higher every year for the past 7 years. But in November, the gold bulls took the rally to a new level as gold went on an amazing streak which saw the yellow metal move lower in only 3 sessions in the entire month. At one stretch, it was up 13 straight sessions and was hitting new record highs nearly every day.
"
1330,FCX,"Gold finished November up 13%, its best month in 10 years. For the year, the metal is up 33%.
"
1331,FCX,"The November move has little to do with actual gold demand. India, which is the world's largest consumer of gold, imported only 18 tonnes compared to 34 tonnes in November 2008. While the wedding season lasts until the end of December, and gold jewelry sales are normally strong in that period, there has been weakness even in that market as prices hit new highs.
"
1332,FCX,"Indian consumers are also selling jewelry and other gold scraps into the rally, instead of hoarding it, as prices have become just too juicy to resist. According to Virtual Metals, a precious metal consultant, recycled scrap gold in India rose to 227 tonnes, the highest level in the world, and is now over 50% higher than in previous years. 
"
1333,FCX,"Similarly, other Asian countries are seeing similar patterns of higher recycled scrap gold levels and plunging demand.What Is Driving Gold Prices Higher?
"
1334,FCX,"Obviously, gold has decoupled from demand fundamentals and is being driven by other criteria including inflation fears. Additionally, some investors are viewing it as an alternative to the dollar and other paper currencies.
"
1335,FCX,"You can also never underestimate the greed factor. Hedge fund managers are discovering that there's money to be made in the yellow metal. Last year, the flavor of choice for the speculators was oil. This year, apparently, it's gold.
"
1336,FCX,"Recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that hedge funds, private equity funds and other large money managers increased their net long positions in gold to twice the 5-year average. It's now at the highest level since 1993.
"
1337,FCX,"Although gold is very hot right now, with everyone in on the trade, odds are that a big pullback is in the offing. Nothing goes straight up forever.
"
1338,FCX,"During the last 7 years, gold has had substantial pullbacks. In just the last 18 months, gold has declined by double digits 3 times: in March 2008 by 15.5%, in July 2008 by 24.8% and in February 2009 by 11.7%. Metal Exposure in Our Portfolios
"
1339,FCX,"In our portfolios, we have held some gold miners in the past, including Barrick Gold (ABX), but the gold miners have had difficulties meeting analysts' estimates. Those miners that do have solid fundamentals and rising estimates are a little too expensive in even just a price-to-earnings criteria for our blood. When there is a pullback, we'll revisit it.
"
1340,FCX,"We currently own Freeport McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) which operates one of the largest gold mines in the world but is also a big copper producer. Like gold, copper has also climbed in 2009 and is at 14-month highs. We like the combination of owning both the precious and the industrial metals.

(CR  -  Free Report) manufactures highly engineered industrial products for aerospace, electronics, chemical and transportation markets. We like this company for several reasons, including the fact that there is nothing like it in the Growth & Income portfolio so it adds diversification. 
"
1343,FCX,"The Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) company boasts an industry-leading yield of 2.7% and posted solid third-quarter earnings of 60 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25%. Crane hiked the lower end of its earnings outlook, and analysts followed suit. The full-year Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.05 per share climbed 8% over the past month.

1359,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jul 25.Last quarter, the mining company reported a negative earnings surprise of 11.76%. Freeport missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 41.30%.Freeport’s shares have declined 17.1% in the last six months versus the 0.9% growth of its industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayFreepost, in last earnings call, revised its annual guidance and the company now anticipates sales volumes for 2017 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper (down from 4.1 billion pounds expected earlier), and1.9 million ounces of gold (down from 2.2 million ounces expected earlier). Freeport expects to produce 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 440,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum in second-quarter 2017. Estimated sales volumes assumed normal operating rates at PT-FI beginning mid-Apr 2017.The company assumes that the average prices of gold and molybdenum to be $1,250 per ounce and $9 per pound for the balance of 2017.Lingering uncertainties surrounding the Grasberg mine in Indonesia is weighing on the company's stock. Freeport’s copper sales volumes in Indonesia slid 28% in the first quarter, hurt by regulatory restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) concentrate exports since mid-Jan 2017. Gold sales volumes also fell in the quarter. Although PT-FI has resumed exports, Freeport cut its copper and gold sales volume guidance for 2017, partly due to the impact of the suspension of exports in Indonesia. Freeport has also reduced its Indonesia workforce by 10% and cut investments in the Grasberg underground expansion.The uncertain copper pricing environment represents another concern. Freeport’s average realized copper prices fell roughly 6% in 2016. While copper prices have enjoyed a healthy run so far in 2017, prices are expected to remain under pressure in the second half of the year on concerns over an economic slowdown in China. Moreover, uncertainty regarding inventory levels may also cause fluctuations in copper pricing.Concerns over a possible economic slowdown in China (a major market for copper) add to the woes. China’s move to tighten credit growth could hurt demand for copper in its property and infrastructure sectors. Chinese copper demand growth is expected to moderate on a year over year basis in 2017.Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Freeport-McMoran, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Freeport is currently pegged at +5.26%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents and 19 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which when combined with positive ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +21.43% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.  Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +13.33% and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Iamgold Corporation (IAG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +300.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1360,FCX,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
1361,FCX,"Iron and steel commands a major chunk of the global metals market -- more than half the metals industry in terms of volume, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products.
"
1362,FCX,"The precious metal and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
1363,FCX,"The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically, it has suffered from overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The weakening outlook for global economic growth has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. These near-term challenges aside, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and OutlookSteel
"
1364,FCX,"As the major stakeholder in the metals market, the steel industry was severely hurt by the global economic downturn. Recovery, however, was swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 Mt in 2011, a 6.8% annual jump. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 377.3 Mt, and improved further to 388.4 Mt in the second quarter. Moreover, recent data shows that crude steel production for July and August was at 252.5 Mt, trending 0.4% higher than the comparable period last year.
"
1365,FCX,"China retained its leadership position among the steel producing countries, yielding almost half of the global output at 48%, growing 2% year over year so far in the third quarter. Japan, the second largest producer, posted a 2% increase. The United States held the third position, producing 14.8 Mt of crude steel, flat annually and constituted 6% of the total global output. Asia improved 2.3% to 166.8 Mt, while production in Europe was a dampener, declining 4.5%.
"
1366,FCX,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has shown significant promise. Auto sales in the U.S. surged 13% to 1.19 million vehicles for the month of September 2012. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) went up 13.7% to 14.9 million vehicles from September last year, the highest sales rate in the last four years.
"
1367,FCX,"Auto sales for the first nine months of 2012 averaged 14.5 million SAAR and grew a promising 15%. The robust growth rate in the sector has been fueled by strong pent-up demand, cheap financing, launch of several redesigned and fuel-efficient vehicles, rebound in consumer confidence, thanks to a growing belief that the housing market is recovering.
"
1368,FCX,"The construction sector had been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, recent figures suggest a turnaround in the non-residential as well as residential construction sector. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximate nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, stood at 48.7, up considerably from 45.9 registered in June.
"
1369,FCX,"Even though in the negative territory (since any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings), the index level pointed toward a moderation in the downturn. The momentum picked up in August with ABI climbing back into the positive territory with a score of 50.2 for the first time in five months.
"
1370,FCX,"The American Institute of Architects projects a 4.4% increase in spending this year for non-residential construction projects, on the back of increase in demand for industrial facilities so far this year along with sustained demand for hotels and retail projects. The spending is expected to accelerate further to 6.2% in 2013.
"
1371,FCX,"As per the U.S. Department of Commerce, housing starts increased 29% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 750,000 in August 2012 compared with August 2011. Building permits in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 803,000, 24.5% higher than the year-ago figure. It is worth mentioning that building permits in July this year had touched the highest level in four years at 811,000.
"
1372,FCX,"In a nutshell, record-low mortgage rates, rising rents and reduced prices of properties are luring buyers. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally stabilizing and is on the road to a much awaited recovery.
"
1373,FCX,"Reflecting on the second quarter results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) -- we see revenues were constrained due to drop in average steel prices. This does not come as a surprise, however, as oversupply in the U.S. steel industry and increased steel imports in the domestic market affected steel prices, hurting margins and profits of steel players in the process.
"
1374,FCX,"Looking forward to the third quarter, the steelmakers expect profits to be lower than the second quarter due to continued increase in steel imports, decline in average realized prices along with macroeconomic uncertainty and sluggish growth in emerging markets.
"
1375,FCX,"For 2012, the World Steel Association provides a muted outlook, projecting a 3.6% increase in global steel usage, a sharp deceleration from 5.6% growth in 2011. This reflects a continuing slowdown in Chinese steel demand and Eurozone debt crisis uncertainties. Furthermore, questions about the U.S. growth outlook also loom large.
"
1376,FCX,"After recording a 6.2% growth in 2011, China’s steel usage in 2012 is estimated to grow 4% to 648.8 Mt as the economy is entering a less steel-intensive growth phase as a result of the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy and restrain the real estate bubble. After a weak performance in 2011, India is expected to grow by 6.9% to 72.5 Mt. Japan’s steel usage is expected to drop 0.6% to 63.7 Mt in 2012, due to the impact of exchange rate appreciation despite the reconstruction activities after the March 2011 earthquake.
"
1377,FCX,"In 2013, world steel demand is expected to increase 4.5% to approximately 1,486 Mt. China’s steel usage is expected to grow 4% to 674.8 Mt from the 2012 projections. India is expected to pick up pace and grow 9.4%, triggered by urbanization and surging infrastructure investment. In 2013, the steel use in the U.S. is envisioned at 99.5 Mt, recording 5.6% growth. Brazil is expected to grow 6.7% to reach 52.5 Mt in 2013. Japan is expected to decline further by 2.2% to 62.3 Mt, comprising 77% of the 2007 level. Europe is, however, expected to record a modest recovery of 3.3% to 155.8 Mt in 2013.
"
1378,FCX,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker in terms of volume and Europe's largest steelmaker, had earlier decided to idle five of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe and announced the extended idling of a number of facilities. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. To reduce its exposure to Europe, the company recently sold its 24% share in European energy company, Enovos International.
"
1379,FCX,"Steelmakers are increasing their consolidation efforts, particularly in China and India, in order to derive economies of scale and other synergies to remain competitive. A major development in this sector was the recent merger of Japan's largest and world's sixth-largest steel maker Nippon Steel Corporation with 27th-ranked Sumitomo Metal Industries to form the world's second biggest steel firm - Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMY). With a combined capacity of 46.1 million tons, it is set to replace China's Hebei Group in the second position, which has a production of 44.4 million tons. The merger is targeted to generate savings in the face of increasingly intense global competition.
"
1380,FCX,"To sum up, despite plagued by overcapacity and softening prices, the outlook for the sector is not that bad. The outlook for key end-markets in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors remains favorable. The faltering construction sector is showing signs of a turnaround.
"
1381,FCX,"China’s recent attempt to bolster its economy by approving 60 infrastructure projects worth more than $150 billion will help lift up the steel sector. Prices could potentially stabilize on the back of a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, in particular China, India and South Korea.
"
1382,FCX,"Furthermore, the sector will also benefit from the Federal Reserve’s move to boost the U.S economy. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the industry.Gold
"
1383,FCX,"As per the World Gold Council, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
1384,FCX,"In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, gold demand was at 990 tons, down 7% year over year. Increase in demand from central banks was offset by declines in demand for jewelry, investment and in the technology sectors, due to higher prices. Central banks continued to be the primary purchasers of gold, accounting for around 16% of total gold demand, at 157.5 tons. This was a record quarter for central bank, buying more than twice the purchases in the second quarter last year.
"
1385,FCX,"In absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $51.2 billion, a 1% decline from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the first quarter stood at $1,609.49, 7% above the prior fiscal’s quarter.
"
1386,FCX,"Investment demand declined 23% to 302 tons, due to lower demand for ETFs and physical bars, particularly in India and China. Gold demand in the technology sector was 1,112.2 tons, a 5% decline year-over-year due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, uncertainty in Europe and substitution to more affordable alternatives.
"
1387,FCX,"Jewelry demand dipped 15% to 418.3 tons due to higher price levels. Jewelry demand in India, a major consumer of gold, was down 30%, mainly due to a deprecation in the Indian rupee against the US dollar, which led to record high local prices. Furthermore, slowing GDP growth, domestic inflation, high interest rates and below average monsoon rain also contributed to the decline. Gold in India is currently at an all-time high in rupee terms.
"
1388,FCX,"In China, another major market, demand for gold decreased 9% to 93.8 tons as consumers were discouraged by the slowing GDP growth and the lack of clear trend in gold price. However, China is expected to resume its pace as economic growth is expected to pick up as a result of the monetary easing implemented in the second quarter.
"
1389,FCX,"Mine production inched up 3 tons to 706.4 tons, up 3% year over year. Adverse weather conditions, interruptions at few operations and slower ramp up of production at few mines affected the production numbers during the quarter. Recycling activity decreased 12% to 363.7 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,059.1 tons, down 6% year over year.
"
1390,FCX,"Russia is becoming an important player in the global gold market. The Central Bank of Russia remains a significant purchaser of gold. A healthy domestic economy is driving the demand for gold jewelry in the region, catapulting it to the position of the world’s fourth largest gold jewelry consumer. The region accounts for 8% of the total global gold output.
"
1391,FCX,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce in 2011. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,791.75 per ounce, with an average of $1,656.18 per ounce.
"
1392,FCX,"Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Furthermore, the announcement of a third round of quantitative easing led to a surge in the price of gold. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect this year to be stellar for gold.
"
1393,FCX,"This climb in gold prices has not translated into increased revenues at all of the gold miners. In the second quarter, while revenues at Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM  -  Free Report) benefited from higher average realized price of gold, Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) could not capitalize from them due to increased cash costs. Moreover, Goldcorp was riddled with production issues at its Red Lake mine.
"
1394,FCX,"As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as Barrick Gold and Goldcorp being unhedged producers of gold will enjoy significant leverage to gold prices. The cost increases need to be controlled in order to rake in profits. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont and Kinross are slated to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
1395,FCX,"Ironically, rallying gold prices have not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold, rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may be entangled in labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
1396,FCX,"Gold remains a coveted asset, given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers, and is considered a safe-haven investment. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option.
"
1397,FCX,"The European sovereign debt crisis promoted gold as a currency hedge for European investors.
"
1398,FCX,"Lingering economic concerns, higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, and the relentless Euro-zone debt crisis will continue to drive gold prices this year, as well. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.Aluminum
"
1399,FCX,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.Alcoa, Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, kicked off the third quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 9% due to a 17% and 20% year-over-year decline in the realized metal price and realized alumina price, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 3 cents compared with 6 cents per share earned in the second quarter.
"
1400,FCX,"Results were down sequentially due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe. Alcoa’s results in the past two quarters have suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices.
"
1401,FCX,"The company has trimmed its 2012 outlook expecting global aluminum demand to go up by 6% this year from the earlier expectation of 7%, due to the slowdown in China. Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
1402,FCX,"Alcoa’s positive long-term outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Rio Tinto plc (RIO) plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs. In line with this, Rio recently sold its U.S.-based wire and cable business Alcan Cable for $185 million. BHP Billiton Limited (BHP) is also mulling the sale of its aluminum and nickel operations to exit from its non-profitable projects.
"
1403,FCX,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining by 2015. The company is curtailing 390,000 metric tons of its system smelting capacity to improve its competitive position. Alcoa permanently closed its smelter at Alcoa, Tennessee, and two lines at Rockdale, Texas. Alcoa has completed partial curtailments at La Coruña and Avilés, Spain. The curtailment at its Portovesme, Italy smelter is underway.
"
1404,FCX,"This trend will continue until aluminum prices recover. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been trending down lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
1405,FCX,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve globally. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and its light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
1406,FCX,"Further, the surge in copper prices observed earlier this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on more economical metal. In response to the spurt in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
1407,FCX,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
1408,FCX,"The China stimulus plan and QE3 announcement will also work as positives for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, or Chalco  should also benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
1409,FCX,"Copper is a major industrial metal, with its price strongly correlated with the outlook for economic growth. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
1410,FCX,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage reflects its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
1411,FCX,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound, due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
1412,FCX,"However, copper prices have since improved, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. In 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.39 per pound to $3.93 per pound, averaging $3.77.
"
1413,FCX,"However, during the second quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices declined ranging from $3.29 per pound to $3.89 per pound, averaging $3.57 per pound. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and a slowing U.S. economy. The drop in price has affected the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont.
"
1414,FCX,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
1415,FCX,"Despite the near-term challenges, the long-term outlook for the copper remains positive, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Outlook
"
1416,FCX,"Growth in emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. However, of late, demand in China has slowed down as the government cut its 2012 target growth rate to 7.5%, the lowest year-on-year growth projection in eight years. China’s recent $150 billion infrastructure has helped improve sentiment and holds promise for the metals and mining industry.
"
1417,FCX,"In the developed world, persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. The U.S. economy, which looked very promising earlier this year, no longer offers a robust picture. The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the economy’s momentum and its recent announcement of another round of quantitative easing, will hopefully jumpstart growth once again.
"
1418,FCX,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.

A Focus List DeletionW&T Offshore (WTI  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List after the close on Feb 1. As we discussed in the closing commentary the last few sessions, WTI has been hit by a decline in crude prices and investors turning against the energy sector, in general. WTI's fundamentals are unchanged. However, due to the large sell-off in the stock of over 25%, we're going to contain our losses here. We still like the energy sector and will be looking to re-enter it at a later date. We originally added WTI to the portfolio on Jan 6, 2010.

There was no company news but no news is bad news as Lubrizol has been pre-announcing earnings the last few quarters that were better than expected. Since it hasn't pre-announced this quarter, investors are believing the worst.
"
1429,FCX,"We have a big gain in the stock. We're going to exit our position tomorrow morning ahead of the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report. Lubrizol is in the same industry as NewMarket, which only managed to beat estimates by 2 cents last week, and whose stock was hammered as a result.

"
1438,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter results Thursday morning. While earnings came in above expectations, shares of FCX declined by 9% for the day. The stock is, in part, reacting to China's clamp down on growth. China is a huge consumer of raw materials, benefiting commodities companies like Freeport. As China decides to tighten, Freeport may see an adverse impact.

1444,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX  -  Free Report) reported strong second quarter results on Thursday, surprising Wall Street expectations with net income of $1.37 billion, or non-GAAP EPS of $1.49 which bested the consensus of $1.34 by 15 cents. This was not only more than double the profit from the year-ago quarter, it was the fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise from the miner with the average beat for the past year running at 16% now.
"
1445,FCX,"Revenues in the quarter surged 50% to $5.81 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $5.63 billion. Consolidated sales from mines totaled 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 356,000 ounces of gold and 21 million pounds of molybdenum compared with 914 million pounds of copper, 298,000 ounces of gold and 16 million pounds of molybdenum in the second quarter of 2010.
"
1446,FCX,"Molybdenum is an element with an extremely high melting point and is thus valued in the production of high-strength steel alloys because it readily forms hard, stable carbides. Freeport is able to extract molybdenum from mineral deposits in an oxidized state before processing it.
"
1447,FCX,"The Doctor Orders Profits
"
1448,FCX,"In mid June I was highlighting the extreme buying opportunity I saw in Freeport below $50. My article ""Copper Stocks: Low-Risk Plays for Long-Term Trend"" had three interconnected themes:
"
1449,FCX,"1) Copper demand from China and other Emerging Markets was still trending strong
"
1450,FCX,"2) Copper was under priced near $4 per pound
"
1451,FCX,"3) Freeport and other miners like Southern Copper (SCCO  -  Free Report) were a bargain trading below 10 times forward estimates
"
1452,FCX,"Here's what I wrote then...
"
1453,FCX,"""Copper, the industrial metal with a PhD in economics, may be a buy around $4 just from the looks of the chart alone. And when you consider that China and other emerging markets are not slowing down their rapid and massive urban development much, the demand picture looks like it should be consistently solid for years to come.""
"
1454,FCX,"And here's a current chart of the good Doctor...
"
1455,FCX,"You can clearly see that the rebound in risk appetite in late June that lifted equities also boosted commodities like copper. Also note how strong support was at $4 in June. Coincident with the good Doctor's rise, we saw a $9+ (20%), rally in FCX before their earnings report yesterday.
"
1456,FCX,"A Billion Pounds, and $1,500 Gold, Give Good Guidance
"
1457,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan's consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) are estimated to average $1.01 per pound of copper for 2011, sub $500 per ounce for gold, and $15 per pound for molybdenum for the second half of 2011. This is what company CFO Kathleen Quirk had to say about this quarter's sales and profit picture:
"
1458,FCX,"""Our results in the second quarter included positive pricing of all of our key commodities: copper, gold and molybdenum. Our realized price for copper of $4.22 per pound was over $1 higher than the previous year's period. For gold, our price of $1,509 per ounce in the second quarter of 2011 was higher than last year's $1,234 per ounce realization, and our price of molybdenum of $18 per pound approximated the year-ago period.""
"
1459,FCX,"A company like Freeport which does little forward hedging of gold, gets to reap the full benefits of the strong trend in the barbarous relic. And compared to most gold producers, they have one of the strongest balance sheets in the mining sector.
"
1460,FCX,"If they sell another 350,000 ounces of gold in Q3 at an average price of $1,500 -- the company expects to sell 1.6 million ounces for the year -- that's over half a billion dollars in revenues. And assuming average prices of $4.25 per pound of copper and another billion pounds sold in Q3 and Q4 each, the company's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to exceed $8 billion for the year 2011.
"
1461,FCX,"While EPS estimates have been trimmed back a bit since June to $5.98 for this year and $6.21 for 2012, this still represents a single digit forward P/E multiple. Clearly, the fortunes of both Dr. Copper and Freeport are tied to the pace of emerging markets growth. I'll address the warning shot fired by Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) about the global recovery at the end of this piece.
"
1462,FCX,"Southern Profits On Deck
"
1463,FCX,"The other copper stock I talked about buying last month near $30 -- especially for its 7% dividend -- has also done well in the past month. Southern Copper followed its Doctor's orders and looked strongly ""up and to the left"" with a nearly $6 surge. Another 20% winner on my copper call.
"
1464,FCX,"In that article (linked above) I showed a Zacks Price & Consensus chart which is a great way to see how stock price tends to trend over time with changes in analyst estimates. I noted the steep pullback in SCCO from $50 to $30 on the leveling-off of earnings expectations. Here's what I said then...
"
1465,FCX,"""Southern Copper is another one ripe for upward earnings estimate revisions. If the mood about global growth picks up, you'll see the estimates for SCCO likely tick up too, which could move the name from a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) to a #2 Rank (buy).""
"
1466,FCX,"We haven't seen any upward revisions to earnings estimates yet. But the strong move back above $35 and Freeport's strength today in a quiet market bodes well for SCCO headed into its quarterly results next Friday July 29. Here's a snapshot of the Zacks data for Southern's earnings growth...
"
1467,FCX,"When the CAT Speaks on Global Growth...
"
1468,FCX,"Explaining its earnings miss today, even on record sales and revenues, Caterpillar executives spoke about the slower-than-expected pace of recovery in the second quarter, particularly due to the impacts of the Japan quake devastation.
"
1469,FCX,"But, the company also raised guidance for the second half of the year, noting that excluding the impact of the Bucyrus acquisition, they expect revenues in a range of $54 to $56 billion and earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.25, compared with the prior guidance of $52 to $54 billion of sales and revenues and earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.75.
"
1470,FCX,"CAT anticipates Bucyrus will have a negative impact of $0.50 per share on profit during the year. Thus is the price of becoming the largest maker of mining equipment in North America and if analysts were caught surprised by this, it will quickly sink in and be looked past.
"
1471,FCX,"Keep in mind that both the company and Wall Street analysts have an incentive to be conservative in their guidance and estimates, respectively. And the 6% profit-taking in CAT today is probably presenting buying opportunities for many who still believe in the global growth story as I do.
"
1472,FCX,"This optimism also bodes well for our copper stocks. Throughout the early quarters of the recovery in 2009, CAT CEO Jim Owens and his successor Doug Oberhelman were important ""prophets of profit"" as they described the strong global demand for construction and mining equipment coming from emerging markets. I recommended and bought many industrial, materials, and energy stocks in 2009 and 2010 based on their analysis of the global economy -- and CAT's rising earnings because of it.
"
1473,FCX,"In this way, Caterpillar was as much a solid forecasting economist as Dr. Copper. Thankfully, both are still looking up now.

"
1475,FCX,"Today I review two short or ""naked"" put trades I have talked about this month to show tactical examples of how this option strategy can be used successfully to either generate income or to buy your favorite names at a discount. On paper, one of the trades is a winner, and one is a loser. But even the loser I am very comfortable with and I will explain why in detail.
"
1476,FCX,"We'll knock out the winner first and review the positive rationale and mechanics for using puts to earn option premium or to establish a buying level for a stock. On June 1, I talked about selling puts on Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) on any weakness because as stock prices fall, put prices rise. I specifically mentioned selling the July 48 put for $2.00 as the stock sold off about 4% on the day.
"
1477,FCX,"If FCX is below $48 anytime before July options expiration, the holder of the naked put could be assigned and forced to buy the shares at the strike price, less the initial credit of option premium received. Put buyers rarely exercise early, but since it can happen at any time and since put sellers are obligated to be long stock up to expiration, the seller of the put must post sufficient margin capital to cover that risk.
"
1478,FCX,"In some cases, the margin requirement can be the full amount of the purchase price of the shares, in this case $4,800 per naked put contract. But brokers do allow more flexible margining depending on the type of account you have and your option trading experience. See the June 1 article ""Strategic Put Selling"" for more details.
"
1479,FCX,"Earning a $2 Dividend, or Buying FCX at $46
"
1480,FCX,"If July expiration comes and FCX is above $48, anyone who sold the July 48 put for $2.00 will keep that option credit as income. In the most conservative way, you could look at this as a 4% return in about six weeks. Not a bad play and better than just about any annual dividend payment you could have earned elsewhere.
"
1481,FCX,"On the other hand, if FCX falls below $48 and you are assigned, you would buy the shares at an effective price of $46 because of the $2 option credit received up front. I call that buying the stock ""at a discount."" This scenario may still unfold with stock trading back and forth around $48 with less than three weeks to expiration.
"
1482,FCX,"The good news is that you could actually buy this option back today for less than you sold it for, even though the stock is lower than when I recommended the trade and put prices should theoretically be higher. FCX was trading around $49.50 at the time of the initial idea when the put was at $2.00.
"
1483,FCX,"Today, with FCX trading as high as $48.50 on the rebound from nearly $47 last week, the July 48 put could have been bought back for $1.60, netting a 40-cent per share profit and eliminating the risk of the naked put position. The primary reasons the option has become cheaper are time value decay and lower implied volatility -- i.e., risk -- in the option price.
"
1484,FCX,"Had a large rally occurred in FCX, we might be talking about buying back this option for a 25 cents or even a dime. Considering stocks have basically sold-off for the past few weeks, this isn't a bad outcome at all to be able to buy it back for a profit if we wanted. Obviously, institutional players feel that FCX is worth accumulating at these levels as well since the stock has found support in the mid-$40's.
"
1485,FCX,"Defined Risk, Precision Entry
"
1486,FCX,"You can see from the multiple scenarios at your disposal -- earn option income, buy stock at a discount, or close options early for a profit (or breakeven, or a loss) -- that you have lots of pre-determined control and choices with naked puts. And all of them give you sleep-at-night risk since all outcomes can be envisioned in advance.
"
1487,FCX,"And with all the choices of expiration and strike, you can tailor a trade to suit your risk/reward preferences. In the original trade idea from June 1, I also suggested looking at moving down in strike and out in time to capture more premium and lower the near-term risk of assignment by considering the January 45 put for $5. In other words, you get to define ""sleep-at-night"" risk for yourself.
"
1488,FCX,"This makes short puts a very powerful tool and weapon -- as long as you remember that selling them naked carries the same risks as buying the stock, since a significant slide or gap down in shares could virtually guarantee assignment and force you to buy the stock at the strike price, or exit the option for a loss if you choose. In any scenario, it's exactly like you are selling insurance to the market and you want to make sure you are comfortable with the premium you are getting paid for your risk.
"
1489,FCX,"Speculating on Crude With Tolerable Risk
"
1490,FCX,"In late May, even as I wrote about the strong probability of a sideways-to-lower stock market for the summer, I was bullish on crude oil and related equities. I took a stand there by selling puts on the United States Oil Fund ETF (USO  -  Free Report). I sold the July 39 strike puts for $1.65 on a bet that crude would stabilize near $100 and the USO would stay above $40.
"
1491,FCX,"I have done this trade profitably about five other times in the past nine months where I sell a front or second month put to collect premium. I never buy USO calls to speculate on crude because the ETF has severe limitations in its ability to track the underlying commodity and thus the calls don't appreciate in any meaningful way to make the risk worth it.
"
1492,FCX,"To see what I mean, just pull up a chart of USO and see how it has gone basically sideways between $35 and $40 for two years (the 50-week moving average is $37.77) while crude has launched from $35 to $115 since the credit crisis.
"
1493,FCX,"But selling USO puts is a no-brainer to me because I get paid up-front and if crude rallies, I keep the money. If crude goes sideways or even falls, I may still make a profit by buying back the puts as their premium erodes. And in the ""worst case"" scenario, the ETF falls below my sold strike price and I get assigned to buy the shares.
"
1494,FCX,"Which is exactly where I am now since USO is trading below $36 and I am obligated to buy 100 shares of the ETF at $39, less the $1.65 I received in advance. My breakeven here is $37.35 and I am almost $2 ""in the hole."" But I'm fine with that for a few reasons.
"
1495,FCX,"Tactical Put Selling
"
1496,FCX,"First, that was the bet I was willing to make on crude at the time and I don't second guess it in hindsight because given the information I had then, I would do the same again. I was in good company too as Goldman Sachs had just upped their forecast on Brent for the rest of the year.
"
1497,FCX,"Be that forecasting error as it may, it was a global-macro call on a volatile commodity and since I didn't go ""all in,"" Im not worried at all about buying it at $37.35 next month when I will likely be assigned. I'm not worried especially because I see crude above $95 and USO back above $38 in the next six months.
"
1498,FCX,"Second, based on my above views, I might actually scale into this position, adding new naked puts at the 36 or 33 strike as we go down or simply sideways. Right now, I'll wait and see if we get a bigger swoon in risk appetite that takes equities for a short-term bath and commodities with them. That kind of volatility will certainly bring higher put premiums to capture.
"
1499,FCX,"Third, on this particular instrument, the USO ETF, I am very comfortable taking long positions because I know it's not going to zero. Think we'll see WTI at $65 again anytime soon, driving USO below $30? Sure, its possible but I'll be betting against that possibility. And even if it does, I am not worried about USO imploding -- barring any ""black swan"" fund construction or maintenance issues -- because unlike an individual company, crude is not going to become worthless anytime soon.
"
1500,FCX,"The bottom line here is that every investor-trader could learn to use naked puts as part of their approach to markets. It's not a tool for all stocks and all circumstances, but it is a strategic weapon that can be used to tactically define risk and execute buy points in advance. Think of yourself as an insurance company managing global risk and of naked puts as unique buy-limit orders that pay you while you sleep, worry free.

"
1517,FCX,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
1523,FCX,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.00In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

1597,FCX,"• Bottom-up estimates: $59.81 for 2009, $76.06 for 2010, $90.84 for 2011
"
1598,FCX,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

"

"
1731,FCX,"•    Top Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $73.45 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top line as well as bottom line expectations and surprise information. This is very much of a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
1732,FCX,"The third quarter was a fantastic earnings season. With all of the reports in, there have been 379 which have exceeded expectations while only 72 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.26. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over deliver, this quarter the beats beat the misses by close to twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
1733,FCX,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed their earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.07%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal.  Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season. For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 226 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth, versus 271 which have fallen short of year-ago levels, a ratio of 0.83.
"
1734,FCX,"On the top line it was also a successful reporting season relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues were 10.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 276 firms reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus 195 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.42. On the other hand, only 149 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 349 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.43.
"
1735,FCX,"Put another way, only 29.8% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago. However, on a sequential basis revenues did rise by 2.9%. Looking forward, in the fourth quarter revenues are expected to be up by 2.9% sequentially and by 1.9% year over year. In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
1736,FCX,"The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government. The economy is growing due to increases in productivity. Higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.
"
1737,FCX,"The strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with four sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut. No sector is seeing more cuts than increases. For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.12, which while slightly lower than a few weeks ago, is still very high and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point.
"
1738,FCX,"The better than expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 1.92 for next year. While the total number of revisions is coming down (seasonally normal) the ratio is still quite bullish.
"
1739,FCX,"Now it is time to turn our focus to the fourth quarter. Saying that the market as a whole faces easy year-over-year comps is a bit like Noah remarking that it looks like rain -- a huge understatement. Total earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to be more than double year-ago levels, up 116.4%. This is mostly due to very easy comparisons after last year’s disaster.
"
1740,FCX,"However, the growth is very much concentrated in a few sectors, most notably the Financials, but with a nice assist from Autos and Construction (although those sectors are far smaller). Consumer Staples also are expected to show extremely high growth largely due to massive year-ago losses at News Corp (NWSA), on what is arguably a non-recurring item (the data is adjusted to remove non-recurring items, but it looks like we slipped on that one).
"
1741,FCX,"Because of the year-over-year distortion from the debacle that was last year’s fourth quarter, it is more instructive to look at the sequential growth (although keep in mind that some sectors, most notably Retail, are highly seasonal). There the picture is far more subdued, with total earnings in the fourth quarter actually expected to be 4.6% below third quarter levels. Although if we see even a normal amount of positive surprises, the level is probably going to be more like flat sequentially.
"
1742,FCX,"Aerospace is expected to be the sequential leader, but keep in mind that this sector was awful on a sequential basis in the 3Q, so that is not real strong evidence of a big underlying growth trend there. In all, 9 of the 16 sectors are expected to post lower total earnings in the 4Q than in the 3Q.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
1750,FCX,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
1751,FCX,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConglomerates -21.64% 100.00% 16.41 8 0 1 8Industrial Products -28.91% 100.00% 13.92 20 1 9 12Consumer Discretionary -14.07% 100.00% 12.10 22 5 8 22Construction 76.05% 100.00% 11.85 6 4 5 6Busines Service 9.12% 100.00% 11.11 8 0 3 6Consumer Staples 2.40% 100.00% 10.53 40 4 31 13Computer and Tech -9.95% 100.00% 7.69 57 8 34 48Aerospace -59.63% 100.00% 6.74 8 2 4 6Basica Materials -47.72% 100.00% 6.73 14 4 4 16Utilities 5.56% 100.00% 5.63 27 8 23 14Medical 3.62% 100.00% 5.63 36 1 34 9Retail/Wholesale 2.18% 100.00% 5.41 38 5 26 20Finance 416.90% 100.00% 5.41 56 16 39 39Oils and Energy -62.90% 100.00% 4.84 29 10 2 39Transportation -36.21% 100.00% 3.09 7 2 1 9Auto 183.55% 100.00% 1.54 3 2 2 4S&P -10.70% 100.00% 7.07 379 72 226 271Sales Surprises

1814,FCX,"Copper, the industrial metal with a PhD in economics, may be a buy around $4 just from the looks of the chart alone. And when you consider that China and other emerging markets are not slowing down their rapid and massive urban development much, the demand picture looks like it should be consistently solid for years to come.
"
1815,FCX,"Two copper miners are worth examining now while their stocks have pulled back and consolidate around softer “slow growth expectations. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX  -  Free Report)
"
1816,FCX," is the world’s lowest cost copper producer and has an excellent balance sheet with strong free cash flow and a forward P/E multiple of under 8 times based on the consensus of analyst estimates.
"
1817,FCX,"Below is a table of earnings estimates for FCX. First note the leveling-off of earnings from this year to next, as $6.24 to $6.41 EPS only gets you 2.6% growth. Next note the optimism of some analysts, of the 16 covering next year, with the Zacks Most Recent Consensus topping $8 EPS.
"
1818,FCX,"Should a couple of more analysts revise their 2012 projections upward, then you would see the Zacks #3 Rank (hold) likely get bumped up to a #2 Rank (buy). Keep an eye on the China growth story – since they are currently gobbling up half of the world’s newly mined copper – and an eye on the estimate revisions.
"
1819,FCX,"In the meantime, building positions in FCX while it trades between $45 and $50 isn’t a bad idea to play the longer-term emerging markets story. The Arizona-based company has primary mining operations in Indonesia and Spain.South of the Border

1821,FCX,", also based in Arizona, has its primary mining operations in Peru and Mexico. From the company’s 2010 annual report, which says it better than I could:
"
1822,FCX,"“Our greatest strength lies in our copper ore reserves, which at December 31, 2010 totaled 69.3 million tons of contained copper, calculated at a copper price of $2.971 per pound (as of December 31, 2010 the LME and COMEX copper price were $3.42 and $3.43, respectively). In terms of copper reserves, we believe we hold the world’s largest reserve position which guarantees the Company’s long-term sustainability and a satisfactory return on investment.
"
1823,FCX,"Below is a Zacks Price & Consensus Chart for Southern Copper which shows the leveling-off of analyst earnings estimates for both this year and next. Also note the steep pullback in stock price from its all-time highs above $50 back down to $30 as these milder estimates have been absorbed by investors. 
"
1824,FCX,"Southern Copper is another one ripe for upward earnings estimate revisions. If the mood about global growth picks up, you’ll see the estimates for SCCO likely tick up too, which could move the name from a Zacks #3 Rank to a #2 Rank.

"
1826,FCX,"If you like the copper story, on the back of the global emerging market’s story, then just keep your eye on the good Dr. I would be a buyer of the commodity and the related equities on pullbacks below $4.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks.com
"
1827,FCX,"One of my favorite strategies for making money off of your favorite stocks is the short or ""naked"" put, sometimes called ""cash-secured"" by brokers because they will require a certain percentage of your account capital to be used as margin to cover the potential event of assignment. When you sell a naked put, you are obligated to buy 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price if the stock falls below it come options expiration.
"
1828,FCX,"Yesterday I suggested investors should be looking for such opportunities as we enter the summer doldrums and a seasonally-weak period for the market. I named Suncor (SU  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report), and Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) as possible candidates in three different cyclical sectors. These are all Zacks #3 Rank or higher stocks and if you are interested in buying them on a pullback, selling a cash-secured put is one great way to do that.
"
1829,FCX,"For instance, let's say that you like Freeport and would consider buying it near chart support at $48. If you sold the July 48 put for $2.00, you would be obligated to buy the stock at $48 if shares fall below that strike price before July expiration and you are assigned. But in this case, since you received a $2 premium as a credit for selling the put, your effective buy price for the stock becomes $46.
"
1830,FCX,"What if FCX ends above $48 at expiration? You keep the entire option credit, less commissions of course. That's how you generate income on stocks you wouldn't mind buying anyway. You can roughly calculate your rate of return here by using $4,600 as a conservative margin estimate. With 44 days until July expiration, that would give you about a 4.3% return in just over six weeks. Not bad for a stock you wanted to buy ""at a discount"" anyway.
"
1831,FCX,"I say ""at a discount"" because with FCX currently trading around $49.50 as I write, this strategy allowed you to pinpoint the below-market price you wanted to buy the shares for. What's more, you have several combinations of strike and expiration to custom tailor the strategy to your risk-reward preferences. You could go out to January options and down to the 45 strike, which you might be able to sell for $5 if the stock drops another dollar or so. That would give you an effective buy price for the shares near $40.
"
1832,FCX,"In this case, you have taken on more time risk, but you also received a bigger up front option premium for that risk. That's the nature of selling puts, so consider yourself in the insurance business when you do so. You are providing liquidity and insurance to those currently hedging their FCX positions. For full details on the obligations and risks of selling puts, be sure to talk to your broker and ask them for educational resources like the PDF booklet ""Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options,"" published by The Options Clearing Corporation.
"
1833,FCX,"The main thing to keep in mind is to treat the short put strategy as an investment in the stock. Think and act as if you plan to buy the stock at the strike price, less the credit received, and you will have the right frame of mind because the strategy carries all the risks of being long stock. And a great time to implement the strategy is when the market is in a fear-driven move where the prices of options are rising to do a spike in implied volatility, much the way the VIX rises during sell-offs.
"
1834,FCX,"I'll revisit this strategy many times over the coming months as I expect a sideways-to-lower environment for stocks. We should get some good opportunities to either generate income on our favorite names or simply buy them ""on sale."" That's using puts strategically to increase your returns and target pre-determined entry points with an overall more efficient use of trading capital. And, when used on high quality stocks from the Zacks Rank stock rating system, that's smart investing when the rest of the world is running for cover.

1836,FCX,"Key Points:4Q earnings season off to strong start, with 206 of the S&P 500 reports in, median surprise of 4.28% and surprise ratio of 3.73 for EPS, 1.53% and 2.94 for revenues.Reported (206 firms) fourth quarter earnings growth of 31.2%, expected (294 firms) year-over-year growth of 19.5% for the vast majority of firms yet to report. On the Revenue side, 7.88% growth reported, but decline of 1.37% expected for those yet to report.Reported net margins (206 firms) rise to 10.95% from 9.00% a year ago, down from 11.21% in third quarter. Margins excluding Financials rise to 9.46% from 8.83% last year and 9.59% in third quarter.Net margins expected (294 firms) to expand to 7.31% (among yet to report) from 6.03% a year ago, and from 7.26% in third quarter. Excluding Financials, margins expected to rise to 6.77% from 6.43% a year ago, but down from 7.22% in the third quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 43.3% in 2010, 14.7% further in 2011.  Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 12.0%Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 6.09% in 2010, 4.77% in 2011, and 4.89% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues expected to be up 8.99% in 2010, 5.97% in 2011 and 5.45% in 2012.Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.42% in 2009 to 8.67% expected for 2010, 9.50% expected for 2011 and 10.13% in 2012. Major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.13% in 2009, 8.23% expected for 2010, 8.83% in 2011 and 9.39% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.98 for 2011, at 1.82 for 2012 -- both very bullish readings.  Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 2.05 for 2011, 1.66 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity expanding rapidly, making the revisions ratios more significant.S&P 500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, expected to earn $782.9 billion in 2010, $898.1 billion in 2011. In 2012, the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.0057 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.68 in 2009: $82.62 in 2010 and $94.77 in 2011 expected, bottom-up. For 2012, $106.17 expected in early read. Puts P/Es at 15.7x for 2010, and 13.7x for 2011 and 12.2x for 2012.
"
1837,FCX,"The 4th quarter earnings season is in full swing. We now have 206 or 41.2% of the S&P 500 reports in. However, the early reporting firms tend to be a bit bigger and more profitable than the stragglers, and those 206 firms actually represent 56.3% of the total expected net income.
"
1838,FCX,"That, of course, presupposes that all the remaining firms report exactly as expected, which is unlikely. But it shouldn’t be too far off -- those 206 firms also represented 54.0% of all the net income a year ago.
"
1839,FCX,"The reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising 31.2% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 4.28% is also fairly strong, although the ratio of positive-to-negative surprises is only somewhat above normal at just 3.73. Total net income of the reporting firms is 31.24% higher than a year ago, a slight slowdown from the 34.45% growth those same firms posted in the third quarter.
"
1840,FCX,"Big Earners Report First
"
1841,FCX,"It seems the higher growers reported early. The expectations are that the remaining 294 firms will post total net income that is just 19.45% higher than a year ago. That is an acceleration from the year-over-year growth of the third quarter (13.49%). It now looks like the final year-over-year growth will be 25.8% -- up from the implied level of 23.4% as of last week.
"
1842,FCX,"Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, that number implies that the remaining firms would have a median surprise of 0.00 and a surprise ratio of 1.00, which is highly unlikely. Thus growth will probably be well over to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter. At the very start of earnings season, the expected growth was under 20%.Revenues Slow
"
1843,FCX,"Revenue growth, though, is expected to slow down significantly, actually falling 1.37% -- down from positive growth of 8.91% in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among those that have reported is very healthy at 7.88%.
"
1844,FCX,"The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 2.71% year over year from 8.57% in the third quarter. That is in marked contrast to those that have already reported, where revenue growth is up from 7.17% growth in the third quarter.
"
1845,FCX,"Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story. However, as I mentioned above, revenue surprises have been quite strong so far, with a median revenue surprise of 1.53%.Net Margin Expansion
"
1846,FCX,"Thus, the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the Financials, where the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different. Much of the earnings growth in the Financials has come from firms setting aside less for bad debts than they did last year.
"
1847,FCX,"One should be a bit on the doubtful side about the quality of those earnings, particularly in the absence of mark-to-market accounting. Among those that have reported, net margins are 10.95%, or 9.46% if one excludes the Financials, up from 9.00% (8.83% excluding financials) a year ago, but down from 11.21% (9.59% excluding Financials) in the third quarter.  The expected net margin for the remainder is 7.31% (6.77% excluding Financials) up from 6.03% (6.43% ex-Financials) last year.
"
1848,FCX,"Net margins continue to march northward, on a yearly basis. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.42% in 2009. They are expected to hit 8.67% in 2010 and continue climbing to 9.50% in 2011 and 10.13% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different -- particularly during the recession -- if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.13% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and are expected to be 8.23% in 2010, 8.83% in 2011 and 9.39% in 2012.Full Year Expectations
"
1849,FCX,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $782.9 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $898.1 billion, or increases of 43.3% and 14.7%, respectively.
"
1850,FCX,"The early expectation is for 2012 to have total net income of just over the $1 Trillion mark. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.17. That is up from $57.68 for 2009, $82.62 for 2010 and $94.77 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.39%, a P/E of 15.7x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.
"
1851,FCX,"With almost two 2011 estimates being raised for each one being cut (revisions ratio of 1.98), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. The bullish argument is further boosted by such historical factors such as being in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four) and having a Democrat in the White House and the GOP at least partially in charge at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave.
"
1852,FCX,"While there is not a huge sample size of years with that political alignment, those that exist were very good ones for the stock market. Just having a Democrat in the White House has historically meant good things for the stock market. In fact, in the 50 years since JFK “asked not what your country can do for you, the S&P 500 has advanced by a total of 1220 points (from 59.96 to 1280.26 on 1/20/11). Of those, more than all of them (1455) have come with a Democrat in the Oval Office (22 years), while the market has lost a total of 234 points with a GOP President. (Of course, a point gained under Kennedy or Nixon was a bigger percentage move than a point gained or lost under G.W. Bush or Obama).
"
1853,FCX,"Political Gridlock an Obstacle
"
1854,FCX,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling. If it is not raised, the U.S. Government could go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the Government would probably have to shut down (not immediately, as there are a few games that can be played, but if it were to last for more than a few weeks, shutdown and default is likely).
"
1855,FCX,"That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. While it is inconceivable that it will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.
"
1856,FCX,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor and are a major reason behind the rising net margins, and resulting strong earnings growth.Overall, Earnings a Major Positive
"
1857,FCX,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 14.7% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved.
"
1858,FCX,"Growth of 14.7% is not exactly awful. Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 4.77%, or 5.97% if one excludes the Financial sector, is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseSo far, 206 of S&P 500 firms (41.2%) have reported -- that is a big enough sample to suggest this will be another strong earnings season.So far, so good. Median surprise of 4.28%, and a 3.73 surprise ratio (149 beats, 40 misses); 72.3% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 160, falling EPS for 46 firms, 3.48 ratio, 77.7% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 31.2% among those that have reported.Materials and Conglomerates both have double-digit median surprises, Energy and Industrials also strong. Autos and Utilities in negative territory.
"
1859,FCX,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front.
"
1860,FCX,"Early on, the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things.

Excluding Financials, revenues expected rise 2.71% year over year in the fourth quarter. Significant slowdown from the 8.57% growth posted in the third quarter.Four sectors expected to post lower revenues than a year ago, twelve higher. Revenue for the Financials is a major source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense.

1864,FCX,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last four weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify there must be more than three estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50.
"
1865,FCX,"In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
1866,FCX,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit.

"
1898,FCX,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise
"

"
1985,FCX,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.00In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

2046,FCX,"Earnings Preview 1/15/10Next week, the 4Q09 earnings season really starts to gain some steam. There will be a total of 165 firms reporting, including 61 members of the S&P 500. These will include such bellwethers as IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), GE (GE  -  Free Report), Goldman  Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report). It will be a relatively light week for economic data, so earnings will really take center stage.Monday
"
2047,FCX,"• Nothing of significance in terms of hard numbers, but we do get the Treasury TIC data on long-term capital flows.Tuesday
"
2048,FCX,"• Building permits are expected to have risen to 585,000 in December from 584,000 in November. The November numbers were a big disappointment, but that was mostly due to a decline in the very volatile apartment and condo numbers.
"
2049,FCX,"• Housing starts are expected to have rebounded to 580,000 in December from a disappointing 574,000 in November, as with permits the disappointment mostly came from the volatile Apartment and Condo sector (5 or more unit buildings)
"
2050,FCX,"• The headline Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to come in unchanged for December after soaring 1.8% on the back of much higher energy costs in November.
"
2051,FCX,"• Stripping out food and energy costs, the Core PPI is expected to have risen by 0.2%, down from a 0.5% increase in November.Wednesday
"
2052,FCX,"• The only release of any significance will be the weekly crude inventory numbers; last week they rose sharply, but consensus expectations for this week were not available.Thursday
"
2053,FCX,"• Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They rose slightly in the last week, but before that were in a very steep downtrend. Last week there were 440,000 initial claims. Look for the decline to resume. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late, even if one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, but that also reversed last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week, regular continuing claims were 4.596 million, while extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 5.304 million. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!Friday
"
2054,FCX,"Nothing of great significance is due out.Potential Positive SurprisesHistorically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises have a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is expected to report a loss of $0.15, down from a $0.69 per share loss a year ago. The big beat from its main competitor Intel (INTC) raises the odds that AMD will also have a positive surprise. Last time out AMD posted a positive surprise of 36.6% and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 6.3%. AMD has a Zacks Rank of 2.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) is expected to report EPS before non-recurring items of $0.25, down from $0.37 a year ago  In the 2Q, GE posted a positive surprise of 35.0% and over the last month; the consensus estimate for its 4Q earnings is up 1.6%. GE is a Zacks Rank #2 stock.Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) is expected to earn $15.30 per share this year, after losing $0.85 a year ago. In the third quarter, they blew the estimates out of the water with a massive 75.4% positive surprise. Over the last month the mean estimate for the 4Q is up 5.9%. FCX holds a coveted Zacks Rank #1.Potential Negative SurprisesA couple of regional banks with big exposure to Ohio look most likely to disappoint. Key Corp (KEY) is expected to post a loss of $0.39 a share, an improvement from a loss of $0.47 a share a year ago. Last time they disappointed by 20.5%. Worse for this Zacks Rank #4 stock, analysts have cut estimates for this quarter by 1.4% over the last month.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) is expected to lose $0.31 a share this quarter. While that is a big improvement from the $2.06 a share they lost last year, it is still a loss. They disappointed by 155.6% last time out, and analysts have cut the estimate for this quarter by 0.7% over the last month.

"
2104,FCX,"The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing, of metals and minerals. The industry is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of sales.Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. This is due to the per capita consumption in these two counties approaching the U.S./European levels, which could − theoretically at least − double metal demand in the longer term.Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest drivers of metal consumption, more than 50% of the total demand. Other metal consuming industries include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) are big consumers of metals including steel and aluminum.The steel industry, with companies engaged in the extraction of iron ore and coke coal for the processing of iron and steel, is a case in point. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. ArcelorMittal (MT) is the world’s largest steel company with production of 103.3 million tons in 2008.The precious metals and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semiprecious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. The gold industry is dominated by Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization. Demand for gold has been improving sequentially; however, it is significantly lower year over year, distorted by the exceptionally strong demand in 2008.The outlook for jewelry demand continues to remain weak. While the US economy has shown tentative signs of a recovery, a high degree of uncertainty continues to dampen any improvement in discretionary spending. Total supply of gold worldwide contracted slightly in the last three months of 2009. The key factors weighing on the supply were an increase in producer de-hedging and a negative contribution from the official sector, in addition to lower levels of scrap than previous quarters.OPPORTUNITIESWe expect the global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of the user industries. China is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the coming years. Despite the current slowdown in consolidation within the global metal industry, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity remains a critically important growth strategy for companies. While the economic downturn is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years.There has been an upward movement in copper prices in recent months, primarily due to stockpiling in China. Market conditions are expected to be favorable for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Companies like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) which have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for copper in the developing markets.We also expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficit for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA) should benefit from the improving outlook for aluminum and alumina prices.The World Steel Association is forecasting an 8.6% year-over-year decline in steel production, better than the previous forecast of a 14.1% decline, driven by a strong growth in Chinese steel demand. With signs of recovery across the world in the second half of 2009, the association is anticipating global steel demand in 2010 to grow by 9.2% to 1,206 million tons, which is similar to the level in 2008.With steel demand picking up in the last couple of months, steel producers are restarting facilities. Recently, U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) − the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe, has restarted its blast furnace at its Hamilton, Ontario plant after a nine-month shutdown.The current surge in steel demand narrowed losses for the third largest steel maker in the U.S. as well as for Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S. − Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) − in the third quarter of 2009.Gold’s value and wealth preservation attributes continued to attract investors and consumers. According to the World Gold Council (WGC), total demand for the metal in the third quarter of 2009 reached 800.3 tons, or $24.7 billion -- up 15% from the second quarter. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets rebounded from the very low levels seen in the first quarter, while industrial demand started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions.The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. We expect to see a continuing trend among central banks diversifying away from their dollar exposure in their reserves in favor of the proven store of value represented by gold. Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining (NEM) are showing strong levels of production.WEAKNESSESThe global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Overcapacity in the industry could increase the level of metal imports and squeeze metal prices. In the recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in Chinese market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in China increasing metal exports.Key metal consuming industries such as auto, shipbuilding and construction have been experiencing weak demand in the last few quarters, forcing global metal producers to slacken production levels. U.S. Steel slashed production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) had to shrink its output by about 15% in December last year. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to take such a measure, proof of the unhealthy operating environment.As a whole, the steel industry posted weak results in the third quarter of 2009. U.S. Steel recorded its third sequential loss − $3.03 billion, or $2.11 per share − in the third quarter of 2009, in contrast to a net income of $9.19 billion or $7.79 per share in the third quarter of 2008. Commercial metals company AK Steel (AKS) posted a negligible income of $6.2 million compared to $188.3 million in the same quarter of 2008.Despite its relatively higher growth rate compared to the developed world, the outlook for the Indian economy is for lower growth rates compared to the last few years. Nearly 45−50% of the world gold production is consumed in India. Gold is a luxury item in this economy, and the demand downtrend is most visible in large cities where gold is consumed. A slow growth, low inflation and low interest-rate environment is a nightmare for the gold market.Foreign currency is one of the major risks for gold producers, as they usually have their mining operations outside their countries. Revenues and costs for gold producers are primarily incurred in foreign currency. Kinross Gold (KGC  -  Free Report) is one of the top 10 gold producers, which has facilities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Russia and Africa. Although it has a diversified clientele, the operations are vulnerable to foreign currency risks. Hence, any adverse movement will affect cash flows and the profitability of the gold producer.Despite a sharp rise in recent metal prices, future pricing remains uncertain, and we believe continued demand weakness, production resumption by some mills and lower iron ore and coking coal prices in the second half of 2009 may drive monthly prices down again. The recent significant reduction in global metal production in late 2008 and into 2009 has resulted in decreases in many raw material prices. We expect that such prices will rebound only when global metal production returns to more customary levels.

2105,FCX,"Industry Rank Analysis 1-7-09In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 ranked stocks than #4 or #5-ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week.As regular readers of this article know, I like to look for both industries with good overall scores and those that are showing significant improvement in their relative ranking. Because we track 206 different industry groups, I also like to focus on the bigger industries, those with lots of stocks in them. Since the industry ranks are based on the average of the ranks of the stocks in the industry, it is relatively easy for an industry with only one or two firms to float to the top of the list (or sink to the bottom).Allocating stocks across so many different industries is often quite arbitrary, so I also like to find a pattern in a bunch of related industries. It is the pattern of related industries that caught my eye this week. There is a very nice pattern of activity in several industries that have to do with mining. The strength also makes sense based on the fundamentals, since metals prices have been very strong of late.Normally, I would not mention the iron mining group, even though it is tied for 3rd place among all the industries, since it only has two firms in it, and because it only moved up one spot. Then again, there was a limit to how many spots it could move up when it was already tied for fourth place. It is on the list entirely because of Cliffs Resources (CLF  -  Free Report), which is a Zacks #1-Ranked stock.However, along with the ferrous metal miners, the non-ferrous metal miners also look quite good, staying in 14th place for the second week in a row with an average score of 2.33. Two of the six stocks in the group currently hold a coveted Zacks #1 Rank, Anglo Platinum (AGPPY) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report).While the base metal miners look much better on an absolute basis, the precious metals miners are showing very significant improvement. The silver miners jumped 50 spots this week into a tie for 32nd place with an average score of 2.84. Two names there that hold Zacks #1 Ranks are Hecla Mines (HL  -  Free Report) and Buenaventure (BVN). Silver has been stronger than gold on the commodity exchanges of late. That is very normal. The two metals tend to move in the same direction, but silver tends to be the more volatile of the two.The gold miners are a much bigger group, with 31 firms in the industry, which makes it harder for it to find the top (or bottom) industry rankings. It still looks pretty good, though, coming in tied of 78th place with an average rank of 2.84. Goldcorp (GG  -  Free Report) was the only one to win a Zacks #1 Rank, although there were several with Zacks #2 Ranks that are worth looking at.The miscellaneous miners would not normally get a mention in here, since they have a right-in-the-middle-of-the-pack average score of 3.00 and are tied for 102nd place. They did, however, improve by 43 spots from last week. It is also a fairly large industry, with 27 firms in it, and the more firms in an industry the more the average will be close to 3.0. However, two names to consider from the group, both with Zacks #1 Ranks, are Anglo American (AAUKY) and Billiton (BBL  -  Free Report).With the U.S. economy apparently on the mend and China roaring ahead, the raw material producers could be very well positioned. With central banks around the world keeping rates ultra low, precious metals will also tend to benefit. Also, both the Chinese and the Indians have a much higher cultural propensity to store their wealth in precious metals than is true in the West, so as people in those parts of the world become more wealthy, demand for gold and silver is likely to continue to rise.Sector  ""This Week'sZacks Rank "" ""2 Weeks agoZacks Rank "" ""FY10Revisions Ratio "" ""FY10 EstimatesRevised Up "" ""FY10 EstimatesRevised Down "" ""FY11Revisions Ratio""Auto-Tires-Trucks 2.64 2.81 1.65 28 17 3.4Conglomerates 2.77 2.85 2.47 47 19 3.8Basic Materials 2.78 2.86 1.3 127 98 0.98Consumer Staples 2.79 2.72 1.93 135 70 2.96Aerospace 2.88 3.16 1.2 24 20 2Industrial Products 2.89 2.96 1.89 108 57 1.7Computer and Technology 2.9 2.89 3.77 482 128 3.75Business Services 2.92 2.94 1.6 48 30 1.09Retail-Wholesale 2.95 2.82 1.95 240 123 1.99Oils-Energy 2.98 3.05 0.92 246 268 0.98Consumer Discretionary 2.99 3.05 1.65 114 69 1.76Medical 3.02 2.98 1.23 226 183 1.2Construction 3.1 3.04 1.4 35 25 1.54Utilities 3.12 3.06 1.17 55 47 1.76Finance 3.15 3.14 0.92 280 304 0.95Transportation 3.18 3.17 1.43 80 56 1.75

2107,FCX,"Key Points:
"
2108,FCX,"Earnings Surprise ratio (#beat/#miss) at 5.96, almost double normal
"
2109,FCX,"Median Earnings Surprise  7.56%, very strong
"
2110,FCX,"Year over year Earnings Growth ratio (# Pos Growth/# Neg Growth) at 0.66
"
2111,FCX,"Sales Surprise Ratio at 1.54
"
2112,FCX,"Sales Growth Ratio at just 0.41
"
2113,FCX,"Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 6.1% below what those same 198 firms reported a year ago, 5.4% above what they earned in the 2Q09
"
2114,FCX,"Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 4.7% year over year, up 0.5% from 2Q09
"
2115,FCX,"2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 up to 2.48, 2010 ratio at 2.17
"
2116,FCX,"S&P500 expected to earn $560.3 billion in 2008, $699.6 billion in 2010
"
2117,FCX,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With almost 40% of reports in there have been 155 which have exceeded expectations while only 26 have fallen short, a ratio of almost 6:1. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
2118,FCX,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two -- there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.56%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
2119,FCX,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 79 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 119 which have fallen short of year ago levels, a ratio of 0.66.
"
2120,FCX,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 25:1. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.52.
"
2121,FCX,"A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
2122,FCX,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 198 firms that have already reported are 4.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 105 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 68 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.54.
"
2123,FCX,"On the other hand, only 57 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 119 with lower revenues -- a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 28.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
2124,FCX,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
2125,FCX,"The strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only two sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases. Then again, there have been no reports yet for those two sectors.
"
2126,FCX,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.48 -- its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.17 for next year.

2133,FCX,"More than half of reports in for six sectors
"
2134,FCX,"Year over year Earnings Growth ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 0.66
"
2135,FCX,"Massive positive surprises in cyclical Materials, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
2136,FCX,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small.  The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
2137,FCX,"Also keep in mind that the consensus is generally tighter for defensive sectors like Staples and Medical than for cyclical sectors like Materials, thus a 8.96% median surprise for Staples might be more significant than a 12.71 median surprise for Discretionary. Both, however, are impressive.
"
2138,FCX,"Overall, Tech appears to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front, with a 25:1 surprise ratio and a 7.69% median surprise, although strong arguments could be made for several other sectors. Some of the more impressive Tech earnings surprises include Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and SanDisk (SNDK).
"
2139,FCX,"Basic Materials has had the biggest positive surprises, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) particularly impressive.

Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks, it always happens during earnings season.
"
2181,FCX,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase. On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 7.43, so it's not just the cyclicals.

"
2201,FCX,"After seeing a flat day Tuesday, stocks were again little changed on Wednesday as more economic reports came in mixed. The market is searching for direction at the start of 2010 and reluctant to move amid a mixed economic atmosphere. Stocks may continue to move slow until Friday's much-awaited unemployment report.

2206,FCX,"Focus List UpdatesDollar Tree Inc.  (DLTR  -  Free Report) jumped higher in the slow session, adding 5.87% on the day after Family Dollar reported better than expected Q1 results ahead of the bell. Shares of DLTR have been mostly flat over the last few months in spite of rising estimates and an attractive valuation. 
"
2207,FCX,"Dolan Media (DM) has been on a tear the last few sessions as the housing data appears to be taking a turn for the worse. Dolan is a counter-cyclical play on that sector. The stock jumped another 5.04% today. 
"
2208,FCX,"Yesterday, Dolan announced it had acquired an additional 7.57% membership interest in National Default Exchange, or NDeX, in which it already had a 84.67% ownership stake.

"
2210,FCX,"Focus List AdditionsChina Automotive (CAAS  -  Free Report) was added to the Focus List after the close today, Jan 6. The company supplies power steering components for the Chinese auto industry. Over the past 3 months the full-year estimates for 2010 have been soaring, now averaging 91 cents, up from 62 cents. This represents earnings growth of 37%. Shares are trading at about 27 times forward earnings, but the growth rates are creating a good value with the PEG ratio just under 0.8 times. 
"
2211,FCX,"W&T Offshore Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report) was added to the portfolio after the close on Jan 6. The company is an energy explorer primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. While WTI is expected to take a loss this year, mainly due to the price crash in natural gas, analysts are bullish on 2010. The 2010 Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen 13 cents to $1.50 per share in the last 30 days. This represents earnings growth of 482% from 2009. WTI has attractive valuations, with a forward P/E of just 8.2. W&T Offshore is also a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock. It provides us with some energy exposure in the portfolio.
"
2212,FCX,"Focus List DeletionsGoldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List after the close today, Jan 6. The Wall Street giant, as we said yesterday, continues to suffer through a rash of estimate cuts, with Meredith Whitney being the latest to lower her outlook. Over the past 30 days there have been roughly twice as many lowered revisions than raised. The bank is expected to post a contraction in EPS in 2010 and at the rate estimates are falling, it could be a steeper decline than expected.  
"
2213,FCX,"Schweitzer Maudit (SWM  -  Free Report) was removed from the portfolio after the close today, Jan 6. Shares of SWM have been trending higher for the last few months but it recently fell to a Zacks Rank #4 (sell) stock on some downgrades to the next-year estimate. We still like this company but we follow the Zacks Rank system very closely so it's time for us to close our position with a solid gain. 
"
2214,FCX,"Wall Street saw fresh highs for the year on little economic news but promising earnings reports. Upbeat reports from companies like Eaton Corp (ETN  -  Free Report) and Gannett Co. (GCI) are putting some investors in a buying mood, signaling that the economy may bounce back sooner than anticipated.  
"
2215,FCX,"The Dow jumped 96.28 points, or 1%, to 10,092.19. The S&P 500 picked up 10.23 points, or 0.9%, closing at 1,097.91. The Nasdaq advanced by 19.52 points, or 0.9%, to 2,176.32.

"
2220,FCX,"Shares were up 3.38% for the day and continued to rise in after hours after the earnings announcement. As a result, TXN's portfolio loss was reduced to 6%. We are watching this one closely but will continue to hold here, looking for a turnaround into positive territory.
"
2221,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) was the Focus Lists top performer today on higher commodities. The stock is very close to a 52-week high and has gained 17% since being added to the portfolio in early September. We will continue to hold as we expect more upside form FCX.

"
2227,FCX,"Earnings estimates for Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2009 is currently $5.19 per share, marking a gain of 37% in 3 months. The 14 covering analysts for the year have also contributed to enhancements of 4.4% in 2 months, 1.6% in 30 days and even a nearly 1% advance in the past week.

In December, Zacks Equity Research reaffirmed its ""Outperform"" rating on FCX, stating: ""We believe market conditions will remain favorable for copper for the next couple of years, driven by higher consumption of metals in the developing economies."" Cantel Medical Corporation (CMN) has put together 7 consecutive quarters of EPS above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Taking just the past 4 quarters into account, this provider of infection prevention and control products has surprised by 24% on average.

"
2276,FCX,"Analysts continue to raise more estimates than they are cutting. Unlike recent weeks, the total number of revisions is now rising, meaning that the changes in the revisions ratios are now being driven more by new estimates being made than old estimates falling out.
"
2277,FCX,"Over the next few weeks the total number of revisions will increase dramatically. The increases are wide spread with only 3 sectors seeing cuts on balance for 2009 and only 2 seeing net cuts for 2010.
"
2278,FCX,"Total net income growth is in the process of turning around - the decline of 23.8% expected for the third quarter is well below the 30%+ declines we have been seeing in recent quarters, and growth should turn extremely positive in the fourth quarter. We are however talking about year-over-year changes, and the change says more about 2008 than it does about 2009.
"
2279,FCX,"On a sequential basis, the total net income for the third quarter is expected to be almost identical to the total net income in the second quarter. Almost all to the 4Q turnaround is due to the financials. In the fourth quarter of last year, the S&P 500 as a whole earned $69.7 billion before non-recurring items as the Financial sector lost a total of $64.4 billion.
"
2280,FCX,"In the fourth quarter of this year the S&P 500 is currently expected to earn $152.6 billion, for a swing of $82.8 billion. The financial sector is now expected to earn $17.1 billion (the quality of the earnings is still lousy), for a swing of $81.4 billion, or 99% of the total improvement.
"
2281,FCX,"On a sequential basis, total net income is expected to fall for the S&P 500 by just 0.2% in the third quarter over the second quarter and to rise by 12.2% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Yes, the fourth-quarter improvement is nice, but it is not as robust as the 119.9% year-over-year gain would seem to indicate.
"
2282,FCX,"The third quarter is somewhat similar, in that year-over-year earnings growth excluding the financials is much worst than when including them, with a decline of 28.8% rather than 23.8%. The troubles started in the third quarter last year for the sector and then got really bad in the fourth quarter.

2340,FCX,"Despite the earnings surprise, the stock finished down 1.48% on heavy volume. After hitting new 52-week highs continuously the last few weeks, the stock was priced for a stellar earnings report. It's not surprising that some investors were disappointed.

Shares also got a shot in the arm when an analyst raised their target price to $41. Today's gain was much needed as the stock was starting to trend lower over the past few days.

"
2358,FCX,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With almost 40% of reports in there have been 155 which have exceeded expectations while only 26 have fallen short, a ratio of almost 6:1. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
2359,FCX,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two -- there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.56%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
2360,FCX,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 79 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 119 which have fallen short of year ago levels, a ratio of 0.66.
"
2361,FCX,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 25:1. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.52.
"
2362,FCX,"A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
2363,FCX,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 198 firms that have already reported are 4.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 105 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 68 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.54.
"
2364,FCX,"On the other hand, only 57 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 119 with lower revenues -- a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 28.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
2365,FCX,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
2366,FCX,"The strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only two sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases. Then again, there have been no reports yet for those two sectors.
"
2367,FCX,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.48 -- its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.17 for next year.

2376,FCX,"Massive positive surprises in cyclical Materials, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
2377,FCX,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small.  The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
2378,FCX,"Also keep in mind that the consensus is generally tighter for defensive sectors like Staples and Medical than for cyclical sectors like Materials, thus a 8.96% median surprise for Staples might be more significant than a 12.71 median surprise for Discretionary. Both, however, are impressive.
"
2379,FCX,"Overall, Tech appears to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front, with a 25:1 surprise ratio and a 7.69% median surprise, although strong arguments could be made for several other sectors. Some of the more impressive Tech earnings surprises include Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and SanDisk (SNDK).
"

Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks, it always happens during earnings season.
"
2422,FCX,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.

"
2451,FCX,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With almost 40% of reports in there have been 155 which have exceeded expectations while only 26 have fallen short, a ratio of almost 6:1. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
2452,FCX,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two -- there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.56%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
2453,FCX,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 79 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 119 which have fallen short of year ago levels, a ratio of 0.66.
"
2454,FCX,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 25:1. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.52.
"
2455,FCX,"A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
2456,FCX,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 198 firms that have already reported are 4.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 105 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 68 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.54.
"
2457,FCX,"On the other hand, only 57 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 119 with lower revenues -- a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 28.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
2458,FCX,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
2459,FCX,"The strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only two sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases. Then again, there have been no reports yet for those two sectors.
"
2460,FCX,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.48 -- its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.17 for next year.

2469,FCX,"Massive positive surprises in cyclical Materials, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
2470,FCX,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small.  The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
2471,FCX,"Also keep in mind that the consensus is generally tighter for defensive sectors like Staples and Medical than for cyclical sectors like Materials, thus a 8.96% median surprise for Staples might be more significant than a 12.71 median surprise for Discretionary. Both, however, are impressive.
"
2472,FCX,"Overall, Tech appears to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front, with a 25:1 surprise ratio and a 7.69% median surprise, although strong arguments could be made for several other sectors. Some of the more impressive Tech earnings surprises include Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and SanDisk (SNDK).
"
2473,FCX,"Basic Materials has had the biggest positive surprises, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) particularly impressive.

On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 7.43, so it's not just the cyclicals.

2535,FCX,"Freeport McMoran Copper/Gold Co. (FCX  -  Free Report) hit yet another 52-week high last week after reporting third-quarter results that were far better than expected, coming in at $2.07 per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. After the great quarter, estimates surged higher, with the current year adding 59 cents and moving to $4.49. The next-year estimate is projecting bullish 41% earnings growth.
"
2536,FCX,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) pulled back from its 52-week high last week in spite of reporting better than expected third-quarter results on Oct 22. Earnings came in at $1.25 per share, easily outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. Since the release the current-year estimate has added 14 cents and advanced to $3.74 per share.
"
2537,FCX,"As gold sets new highs, it would only be natural to assume that profit forecasts for gold mining companies would be soaring too. Surprisingly, profit forecasts are not jumping.
"
2538,FCX,"Though some brokerage analysts have raised their full-year projections in recent weeks, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is not moving higher for most gold miners. Rather, it is essentially unchanged for Barrick Gold (ABX  -  Free Report), Eldorado (EGO  -  Free Report), Goldcorp (GG  -  Free Report) and most of their peers.
"
2539,FCX,"Where are we seeing increases are for companies that are significantly dependant on other metals, such as copper or silver. For example, the 2009 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport-McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) has risen 67 cents over the past 30 days to $3.79 per share. (This morning, FCX reported third-quarter profits of $2.07 per share, topping forecasts for $1.14 per share). Analysts hadPan American Silver (PAAS  -  Free Report) is also seeing expectations rise with the Zacks Consensus now at 75 cents per share, versus 70 cents a month ago.
"
2540,FCX,"Ore Quality Is An Issue
"
2541,FCX,"A big reason why the gold miners are not shining as brightly as the precious metal is the quality of the ore being mined. There is a general school of thought that the miners are digging up ore that is more difficult to process. As result, this is adversely impacting costs.
"
2542,FCX,"When miners dig up gold, they are effectively taking rock out of the ground. Though the goal would be to just dig up gold, the actual rocks contain various other metals and minerals. This means the mining company has to separate the gold from the other metals. Ore is considered to be higher quality when there is a greater concentration of gold in the rocks. Conversely, ore is considered to be of lower quality if the rock contains less gold.
"
2543,FCX,"Obviously, it is in every miner's best interest to dig up higher quality ore. However, as more and more gold is dug up, the quality of the ore decreases, hurting margins. It is this concern that has many analysts unwilling to raise their profit forecasts.
"
2544,FCX,"Investors should note that this is not dissimilar to what is occurring with oil. Many of the newly discovered oil fields are in areas where it is expensive to drill in. An example is Brazil's Tupi field, which lies several miles below sea level.
"
2545,FCX,"Not The First Time Analysts Have Been Cautious
"
2546,FCX,"What's interesting about the lack of estimate revisions is that this is not the first time it has happened. Back in February, when gold broke above $1,000 for the first time this year, I pointed out that brokerage analysts were not raising their forecasts. (Read Why Gold Miners Are Not Glittering.) Rather, analysts were cutting forecasts at that time.
"
2547,FCX,"Since then, gold mining stocks have rallied with Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX  -  Free Report) gaining about 43%. However, had you invested in a fund that tracked the S&P 500 instead, you would have realized an approximate 42% return. In other words, you could have gotten a similar return with considerably more diversification by buying S&P 500 SPDR (SPY  -  Free Report) instead of GDX. (An investment in gold, via Gold SPDR (GLD  -  Free Report) would have only earned you an 11.2% return over the same period of time.)
"
2548,FCX,"As you can see, while gold has been rallying, it has not given investors the best opportunities to profit. The mixed earnings estimate picture for gold miners suggests that the risks of investing in these companies remains elevated. Though gold mining stocks could still go higher, especially if third-quarter margins are better than expected, there are industries whose short-term prospects are brighter.

2610,FCX,"Of course, it doesn't hurt that FCX reported second-quarter EPS that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 100% in late July, leading to solid improvements in earnings estimates.   
"
2611,FCX,"Volume for this Zacks #1 Rank Top Performer is nearly 13 million so far today, which is below the daily average of 20.5 million.  
"
2612,FCX,"FCX is a leading international mining company that operates large, long-lived, geographically-diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum.

"
2620,FCX,"Key Points:Total earnings so far down 9.4% from last year, but up sharply from Q4
"
2621,FCX,"Financials much better than expected, but quality of earnings is awful
"
2622,FCX,"Excluding Financials, total earnings are down 22.2% from a year ago and -12.2% from Q4
"
2623,FCX,"Total net income is down in all sectors but Financials and Health Care
"
2624,FCX,"Health Care, Tech and Discretionary all showing lots of positive surprises
"
2625,FCX,"Full S&P 500 (SPX) total net income expected to be 25.1% lower than last year
"
2626,FCX,"Revisions Ratios improve but remain deep in negative territory
"
2627,FCX,"Bottom-up estimate for S&P 500 now $59.36 in 2009 versus $59.42 last week.
"
2628,FCX,"S&P 500 now expected to earn $74.21 in 2010 versus $74.01 last week
"
2629,FCX,"Total Net Income Growth
"
2630,FCX,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected.
"
2631,FCX,"This is particularly true in the financial sector. However, there the quality of earnings is exceptionally poor, with billions of dollars of earnings due to declines in the prices of their bonds. This is pure accounting nonsense. Mark-to-market is apparently ok for liabilities, but not for assets?  Never mind that most bonds have covenants that require that if the issuer buys back the bond they can only do so after a certain date and at a prearranged price, which is almost always above par.
"
2632,FCX,"If Financials are excluded, the picture is vey different, with total net income down 22.2% from a year ago, and 12.2% lower than in the 4th quarter. The 139 (27.8%) firms that have reported, collectively earned $57.5 billion versus $63.5 billion a year ago and $28.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The 112 non-financial firms have collectively earned $41.8 billion versus $53.7 billion a year ago and $47.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
"
2633,FCX,"Health Care is the only other sector showing year-over-year growth in total net income, and that is just 3.1%. The weakest performances so far in terms of total net income growth have been Materials, Industrials and Consumer Discretionary.
"
2634,FCX,"However, with less than one-third of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far, so the results could still change significantly. Also the percentage of firms reporting is far from uniform across sectors (still no utilities reports for example).
"
2635,FCX,"Still, many of the earnings declines have been less than expected, and the raw number of positive surprises is leading disappointments by slightly more than 2:1. The median surprise is very healthy at 5%. Despite the better than expected earnings reports, estimate cuts continue to run almost 2x the number of positive estimate revisions for 2009 and over 2:1 for 2010.
"
2636,FCX,"Since the first quarter is part of the full year earnings any firm that surprises positively and does not see its full year estimates raised has an implied estimate cut for the remaining quarters of the year. That being said, the current revisions ratio of 0.51 is substantially higher than it was a month ago (0.29). The 2010 revisions ratio has also improved substantially, to 0.46 from 0.27 a month ago. In other words, estimates are being cut, but at a slower pace than then were previously.

"
2643,FCX,"Just over 1 in 4 firms have reported their first quarter results. Of the 33 results in, positive surprises lead disappointments, but by less than the normal margin. The ratio of positive surprises to disappointments stands at 2.08:1, while in recent years it has regularly been well over 3:1. The median surprise is 5.00%, which is above historical norms. These figures will be very volatile in the early going and will most likely change significantly by the time earnings season is over.
"
2644,FCX,"Tech has the best overall surprise profile so far, with 18 positive surprises and just 2 disappointments. The median surprise is a very healthy 10.4%.
"
2645,FCX,"Health Care and Consumer Discretionary also have shown surprisingly good results. By raw count, financials have had just as many disappointments as positive surprises, but the positive surprises have come at the bigger and more significant firms (and are of extremely poor quality). Energy has also been disappointing, but it still very early for the sector with just over 10% of the results in.

"
2654,FCX,"Only Telecom and Discretionary are in neutral territory. The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. The revisions ratio is based on the four week moving totals of estimate changes. Thus the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts falling off faster than old estimate increases than it does with new estimate revisions.
"
2655,FCX,"Technology leads the pack this week. Within the sector, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) was impressive with 12 increases and no cuts, which resulted in a 20.5% increase in its mean estimate. TXN alone was responsible for 1 out of 5 estimate increases in the sector.

2656,FCX,"The weakness in the Industrial sector was wide spread, some of the more significant cuts in the sector were in Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Ingersoll Rand (IR  -  Free Report) and Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report).
"
2657,FCX,"The Materials sector was very weak overall, most of that was due to weakness in the Steel and Paper companies. However, one stock that was moving against the grain of the sector was Freeport McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) where the mean estimate is up more than 90% over the last month.

"
2681,FCX,"Despite the significant equity market rally off the March lows, we still see a challenging global economic backdrop and a less than robust environment for the Machinery sector.As foreign economies deal with weaker exports to the U.S and Europe, industrial customers are cutting back on capital spending. Equipment orders are decelerating in almost every end-market -- from machines used in construction, infrastructure, agricultureÊto base metal projects.There are several data points that help to paint the picture of a sharply deteriorating global economic backdrop. Japan's core machine orders did rise 1.4% in February, but on a y-o-y basis orders were down 30.1%. Orders have fallen in 9 of the last 14 months. What's more, according to the cabinet office in Japan, overseas orders fell 22.9% in February.While a manufacturing survey conducted by the cabinet office indicated core orders would rise 4.1% in the first quarter of 2009, we think this forecast may prove to be too optimistic. We would not be surprised to see core orders decline in each quarter of 2009. Also, in February, Japanese industrial production fell 9.4%. Exports fell 49.4%.Also, according to the VDMA machine makers association, German plant and machinery orders fell a massive 49% in February compared to the same period a year ago, with export orders down 50% and domestic demand down 45%.  Given that February exports fell 23%, we were not surprised to see German industrial production decline 20.6% in February compared to same period of last year.Germany was not alone. Italy saw February output decline 20.7% and Greece saw output decline 4.6%. In fact, the whole euro region saw January industrial production fall 17.3%.The domestic picture appears to be no brighter. Total industrial production fell 1.4% in February, following a decline of 1.8% in January and a decline of 2.4% in December. If one only looks at manufacturing output, the picture is even worse, with a 0.7% monthly decline following declines of 2.7% and 2.9% in January and December, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, manufacturing output is down 13.1%.Capacity Utilization also fell sharply in February, down to 70.9% from 71.9% in January for the overall index. A year ago, the countryÕs factories, power plants and mines were working at 80.7% of capacity, which is just about in line with the long-term average (1972-2008) of 80.9%. Even worse, capacity utilization for manufacturing dropped to 67.4% from 67.9% in January and from 78.5% a year ago.When looking at the global macro backdrop for industrial production and machinery orders amid weaker U.S consumption, we expect a continued slowdown in capital spending.OPPORTUNITIESWhile the credit crunch and slower economic growth dampens private sector spending, fiscal expenditures appear ready to play a counter-cyclical role. China announced a rather large stimulus package in November. In early April, Japan proposed a $150 billion stimulus program, which if approved would equate to almost 3% of GDP.Also, the U.S Congress passed a stimulus package that President Obama signed on Tuesday, February 17, 2009.  The bill contains money that will flow into infrastructure spending.  The only issue is the timeframe of the spending.  For example, according to CBO estimates, of the $27.5 billion in the budget for highway spending (Title XII - Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Highway Construction), $9.625 billion will be spent by the end of FY2010. This equates to 35% in the first two (FY) years and the remaining portion realized through the (FY) years 2011-2016.Amid the current, global economic slowdown, there may be a silver lining. Central bankers have gone from raising interest rates and fighting inflation to slashing rates and flooding the system with liquidity. Specifically, the U.S Federal Reserve has engaged in quantitative easing.  Just recently, the FED announced it would spend over $1 trillion to buy mortgages-backed securities, agency debt, and Treasury securities. In our view, these monetary conditions have helped to put a bid into commodity prices. We would become more constructive on commodity stocks, such as Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report), on signs reflation measures were sustainable into 2010.WEAKNESSESWe remain cautious on the U.S residential construction (& related) space. In our view, there is still too much existing and new home inventory to justify a new up-cycle in starts, which partially impacts the order flow of machinery companies that sell or lease equipment to the homebuilders.On the demand side, the combination of a weaker U.S labor market and low consumer confidence readings does not appear to add to the pool of available homebuyers. On the subject of lower mortgage rates, we think it will lead to a greater amount of refinance activity than it will new home sales purchases.

2736,FCX,"It is going to be an exciting week. The Tour de France could have its general classification shaken up with a brutal mountain stage on Monday. Barry Bonds could break Hank Aarons home run record; he is two shy after hitting two homers at Wrigley on Thursday afternoon. Fans across the world will know how the final confrontation between Harry Potter and Voldemart (sorry, I forgot that I wasnt supposed to say his name) turns out. (And no, I dont know the answer and I dont want anyone spoiling it for me either.)
"
2737,FCX,"The economic calendar will have its first report of note on Wednesday with June existing home sales data. Thursday features June new home sales and June durable goods orders. The week ends with the final University of Michigan consumer confidence index and the advance estimate of second-quarter GDP. 
"
2738,FCX,"Second-quarter earnings will be front and center. We have confirmed scheduled reports for 847 companies, 175 of which are in the S&P 500. Dow components 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), AT&T ( T), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Du Pont (DD), ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Merck  (MRK  -  Free Report) will report. Given the possibility of positive surprises (second-quarter estimates for MMM, BA and XOM have been revised higher within the past 30 days), a further ascent by the Dow into record territory seems likely.
"
2739,FCX,"Speaking of surprises, results for the second-quarter are looking alright so far. Not great, but certainly nothing to complain about either. Approximately one-fourth of S&P 500 companies have reported and positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2.8:1. Median company growth is running at 9.4%. For the broader S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600), growth is a little slower at 8.6%. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a 2.6:1 ratio. Relative to the same point during first-quarter earnings, median company growth is better this earnings season, but the proportion of negative surprises is also higher. Nonetheless, it is still relatively early, so we caution about reading too much into these numbers.

2740,FCX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of July 23  27
"
2741,FCX,"One of the things I focused on in last Wednesdays Industry Rank Analysis was an improvement in earnings projections for multiple oil-related companies. Higher oil prices are causing brokerage analysts to change their earnings assumptions. As a result, both ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) could both top expectations when they report second-quarter results.
"
2742,FCX,"COP said in early July that worldwide refining margins for the second quarter are expected to be significantly higher than the first quarter. Offsetting this may be a decline in production levels because of maintenance, the companys exit from Dubai and a few other factors. Nonetheless, brokerage analysts believe profits will be above first-quarter and year ago levels. The company is projected to report profits of $2.59 per share, 21 cents more than the consensus estimate of a month ago. The Most Recent Consensus is even more bullish at $2.65 per share. COPs first-quarter results were below expectations, but the company did top estimates during the previous three quarters. ConocoPhillips is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jul 25, before the start of trading.
"
2743,FCX,"XOMs market cap was $521 billion on Friday morning, a sign that investors are reacting positively to raised earnings expectations. (To put this number in perspective, ExxonMobil is currently worth nearly 25% more than General Electric (GE  -  Free Report)). More than half of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their second-quarter forecasts on the oil conglomerate during the past 30 days, sending the consensus estimate 17 cents higher to $1.92 per share. The Most Recent Consensus Estimate is more bullish at $1.95 per share. XOM has exceeded expectations during the each of the past four quarters by an average margin of 15 cents per share. ExxonMobil is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jul 26, before the start of trading.
"
2744,FCX,"Volatile copper prices have not deterred brokerage analysts from being optimistic about Freeport-McMoRans (FCX  -  Free Report) second-quarter results. One brokerage analyst raised his forecast over the past week and five others have adjusted their projections during the past 30 days. The net result of these revisions has been a 17-cent increase in the consensus estimate to $2.64 per share. The Most Recent Consensus calls for profits of $2.69 per share. FCX has topped expectations for nine consecutive quarters. Freeport-McMoRan is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jul 25, before the start of trading.
"
2745,FCX,"Despite some bad press, JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report) realized a 1.7-point improvement in its load factor during June. (Load factor is the ratio of passenger miles to available seat miles. The more crowded a plane is, the higher load factor is.) This improvement led six of the 11 covering brokerage analysts to raise their forecasts for second-quarter profits. The consensus estimate calls for the discount airline to have earned 11 cents per share, a penny higher than the average forecast of a month ago. The Most Recent Consensus is predicting profits of 12 cents per share. JBLU topped first-quarter estimates by seven cents per share, but missed fourth-quarter expectations by a penny per share. JetBlue is scheduled to report on Tuesday, July 24, before the start of trading.
"
2746,FCX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jul 23  27Lexmark International (LXK) recently cut its guidance. Citing a decline in inkjet revenues and aggressive pricing and promotion on hardware, the company expects that adjusted earnings to be in a range of 62 to 67 cents per share, including a tax benefit of five cents per share. The company had previously predicted that second-quarter profits would be in the range of 82 to 92 cents per share. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts slashed their forecasts in response, sending the consensus estimate down to 64 cents per share. LXKs first-quarter results were seven cents below expectations. Lexmark is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jul 24, before the start of trading.

2751,FCX,"James M. Iocca (aka: watchlist james) is a studious investor. His investment style was developed through diligent research. Departing somewhat from the momentum type of approach many of the other Simulator top players employ, James relies more on the fundamentals in picking his stocks. 
"
2752,FCX,"This astute investor pays attention to analysts recommendations, and he looks for positive cash flow, solid returns on invested capital and strong balance sheets among other fundamental indicators. While income statements and balance sheets are a big part of his trading game plan, James will also consider important technical attributes, such as stock performance history, current share price trends and the overall market climate. 
"
2753,FCX,"His research tools include Zacks screening strategies, various analyst reports and well-known publications such as the Wall Street Journal and Barrons. 
"
2754,FCX,"This contestants investment strategy enabled him to currently hold 15th place in the Zacks $100K Challenge with an overall return of roughly 53% since the beginning of this year. Some of his current portfolio positions include Holly Corp. (HOC), Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report), CROCS Inc. (CROX  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report) and Massey Energy Co. (MEE) just to name a few. Take a look at this challengers entire portfolio by clicking here. Check out his complete trading history by clicking here.How does he do it?
"
2755,FCX,"This market enthusiast, who has achieved a BS, MBA and is currently working a doctoral dissertation in Business Administration, considers several variables before putting in a buy order. For the most part, he screens through the eyes of a fundamentalist. However, like any successful investor, James checks various technical components as well.  
"
2756,FCX,"He stated that he looks at price/earnings ratios, analysts recommendations, articles relating to the stocks performance in Barrons, Wall Street Journal, Standard and Poor, Dunn & Bradstreet, Business Week, Forbes and Fortune. James added that he also analyzes a stocks performance chart.How does he know when to sell?
"
2757,FCX,"A mix of fundamental and some technical analysis is also implemented before this market player gets rid of a position.
"
2758,FCX,"When I purchase a stock, I set a percentage loss of 5% to trigger a sale. I also scan to check to see if there is an analyst downgrade or if reported quarterly earnings do not meet analysts expectations, replied James. Moreover, if trading value is declining and the stock price is dropping, this could be a sign that the stock should be sold.Where does he see the market at year-end?
"
2759,FCX,"This market watcher said, my stock market outlook is positive because of current and projected economic trends. My prediction as to where the Dow Jones Industrial average will be at the end of 2007 is 14,324.69.Any advice for beginners?
"
2760,FCX,"James advocates avid reading. He suggests investors get their hands on as much business news as possible. In addition, this successful investor is a fan of face-to-face consultations with financial advisors. Such interactions will allow individuals to ask questions and learn how to properly place trades. Two things that James believes are important primers before one delves into the market.
"
2761,FCX,"The reaction to Alcoas (AA) first-quarter surprise has been positive overall. Since the company reported quarterly profits of 79 cents per share, five of the 15 covering brokerage analysts have raised their full-year forecasts. The new consensus estimate calls for earnings of $3.26 per share, five cents above the average projection of a week ago. It should be noted that one analyst did lower his forecast, but he still remains comparatively bullish with a prediction of $3.30 per share.
"
2762,FCX,"Alcoa generated an 11% increase in sales, thanks to both good demand and higher prices. The company saw particular strength in the aerospace market, but also noted that Chinese demand remains very good. CEO Alain Belda described the world market as being robust.
"
2763,FCX,"Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) followed Alcoas report with its own first-quarter surprise. STLD generated earnings of $1.01 per share, three cents above the upper end of its raised guidance and five cents above the consensus estimate. Revenues rose 30%, reflecting strength in the non-residential construction and industrial markets. 
"
2764,FCX,"A decline in prices adversely impacted margins; the company saw its average consolidated selling price drop by $31 per ton on a sequential quarterly basis. The price decline may have been caused by higher inventory levels within the channel during the first-quarter  a headwind that raised concern for the entire industry. STLD observed in late-March that inventory levels at steel service centers had declined, however  a bullish sign. 
"
2765,FCX,"Two of the nine covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts on STLD following the release of the first-quarter results. The new consensus estimate calls for 2007 earnings to total $3.87 per share versus $3.84 a week ago and $3.76 two months ago.

2769,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report), which was first presented on May 17, topped the Streets earnings estimate for the past eight quarters by an average margin of 16.2%. Consensus estimates have been trending higher. Earnings per share are forecasted to grow 35% over the next 3-5 years. FCX has a current dividend yield of 2.2% and a five-year average dividend yield of 1.5%.
"
2770,FCX,"Full Analysis
"
2771,FCX,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc. engages in the exploration, mining and production of copper, gold and silver. The company's operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, PT Freeport Indonesia, PT Irja Eastern Minerals and Atlantic Copper, S.A.
"
2772,FCX,"When FCX was first featured as a Growth and Income stock on May 17, it had exceeded analysts earnings estimates for six consecutive quarters. Over the past two quarters, the company surprised to the upside yet again. For the past eight quarters, FCXs average margin of surprise was 16.2%.
"
2773,FCX,"On Oct 17, the company posted third-quarter profits of $1.58 per share. With analysts calling for $1.50, the company beat estimates by 5.3%. Compared to the prior-year period, earnings soared 83.7%. Revenues jumped 66.8% to $1.64 billion from $983.3 million a year ago. 
"
2774,FCX,"For the first nine months of the year, profits ballooned 105.7% and revenues rose 51.9%. FCX increased revenues for the past four years and grew profits for five years running.
"
2775,FCX,"Consensus estimates for this quarter and next quarter are up 11.0% and 32.4%, respectively, over the past 90 days. Profit forecasts for the full years of 2006 and 2007 jumped 3.2% and 13.1%, respectively, over the same period of time. Earnings per share are forecasted to grow 35% over the next 3-5 years, which crushes the 15% projected growth rate of the industry. 
"
2776,FCX,"The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 31.25 cents per common share of stock on Oct 4. Furthermore, on Aug 1, the Board announced a supplemental common stock dividend of 75 cents per share. The supplemental dividend was paid in addition to the companys regular quarterly dividend. FCX has a current dividend yield of 2.2% and a five-year average dividend yield of 1.5%. 
"
2777,FCX,"FCX is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. Zacks #2 Rank stocks have generated an average annual return of 21.6% since 1988. Because the Zacks Rank has a market cap bias, Growth & Income investors may find a greater number of large-cap stocks by considering both Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) and Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stocks in their selection criteria.
"
2778,FCX,"We are coming to the end of the second quarter and in just a few short weeks we will be in the heart of earnings season. We have been starting to get a few early reports in (we define the second quarter as the fiscal period ending in May June or July) and the results have been extremely positive so far. Granted these firms are not a representative sample, but so far so good. The most noteworthy of the early reporters are four big investment banks, which blew earnings expectations out of the water. 
"
2779,FCX,"However, as we enter the quarter, analysts are a bit on the cautious side with the median year-over-year growth rate expected in the S&P 500 at only 8.3%. That is a sharp slowdown from the 13.2% growth posted in the first quarter. Yet shortly before the first quarter reporting season started the analysts were only expecting 8.9% growth for that quarter. Positive surprises then simply overwhelmed disappointments by better than 3:1 and the actual growth was much higher than expected. It would not shock me at all to see that happen again in the second quarter. The three sectors with the highest expected growth for the quarter are Energy (38.3%), Industrials (16.0%) and Materials (14.3%). All three sectors are also continuing to see strong upward estimate revisions for both this year and next.
"
2780,FCX,"For all of 2006, earnings growth is expected to be very solid. The median expected growth rate among S&P 500 firms is 11.4%, and the strength is expected to continue into next year with 12.9% growth expected. The picture is fairly similar if growth is measured on a total net income basis as well. For 2006, total earnings of S&P 500 firms are expected to expand by 13.6% and continue with 10.9% growth in 2007. There is no evidence that this growth is about to falter. If it were to start to do so, it would first show up in the estimate revisions data. As things stand now, analysts are on balance still raising more estimates than they are cutting. Over the last month, a total of 566 estimates for 2006 were raised while only 488 were cut (ratio of 1.16). For next year there were 508 increases versus 386 cuts (ratio of 1.32). The absolute number of estimate revisions is at a seasonal low point, as earnings season gets underway expect to see the number close to triple. However, the ratio of increases to cuts is still significant. 
"
2781,FCX,"Among the most significant upward revisions in 2006 estimates this week were:
"
2782,FCX,"Phelps Dodge (PD) - While copper prices are off their highs, they are still way up from a year ago. In the last week, PDs mean estimate for 2006 is up 1.25%, and is up 3.84% over the last month. For 2007, the mean estimate is up 2.84% over the last month. For both years, the last month has seen three analysts raise their estimates with none cutting. (The revisions were made to pre-merger forecasts.) Other copper firms such as Freeport-McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper (PCU) have also been seeing upward earnings revisions.Bear Sterns (BSC)  Like the other big investment banks, Bear Sterns reported better than expected earnings. As a result its mean estimate rose 2.89% this week and is up 6.52% over the last month. For next year the mean estimate rose 4.84% over the last month. Nine analysts raised their numbers for this year, and eight for next year while none cut for either year. BSCs competitors such as Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) have also seen similar upward movement in their expectations. Paccar (PCAR)  The maker of big trucks saw its mean estimate rise 1.23% over the last week, and 1.29% in the past month. For next year the mean estimate is up 0.48% over the month. No estimates were cut and two were raised for this year and one was raised for next year. 
"
2783,FCX,"Among the most significant falling estimates were:
"
2784,FCX,"Freddie Mac (FRE)  The mean estimate for this year fell 2.75% this week at the mortgage giant as it reported lower than expected earnings and on news that regulators may cap the size of its investment portfolio. This comes on the heels of a 2.99% decline last week. For the month, the mean extimate is down 6.65%. Five analysts cut their estimates and none increased. I would note that Freddies sister Fannie also suffered estimate declines in the past week. Weakness in the housing market also implies weakness in the mortgage market.KB Homes  (KBH  -  Free Report) Evidence continues to accumulate that the housing market is cooling off rapidly. Over the last week the mean estimate is down 4.24%, and down 9.96% for the month. For the month, six estimates have been cut and none increased. For next year, the drop has been even more pronounced over the las month with the mean estimate falling 16.21% as eight analysts cut and none increased. KBH is far from alone among the homebuilders in seeing its estimates drop for both this year and next. Jabil Circuit (JBL  -  Free Report)  A weak earnings report and plans to shut down most of its domestic manufacturing capacity led analysts to slash their forcasts for JBL. The mean estimate for this year fell 10.35% this week. Over the last month the estimate is down 13.41% as five estimates were cut and none were raised.  For next year, the mean estimate is down 7.54% over the last month due to nine cuts and no increases. 
"
2785,FCX,"The median firm within the S&P 500 is expected to achieve 11.8% growth this year. For 2007, the median expected growth rate for S&P 500 firms is 12.9%. The sectors with the highest expected growth rates (on a median firm basis) are Materials (21.2%), Industrials (16.7%) and Energy (16.7%). The slow growing sectors are Consumer Staples (6.4%) and Utilities (7.3%). The picture is much the same when growth is measured on a total net income basis, with the S&P 500 expected to report earnings 13.6% higher in 2006 than in 2005, and a further 10.9% growth in 2007. While the growth rates for the leading sectors are very similar when measured this way rather than by the median, particularly for 2006, the growth rates for the Technology and Health Care sectors are far more anemic for 2006 when measured on a total net income basis. On the other hand, the Financials will report much higher growth on a total income than a median basis, as will the Utilities.

"
2787,FCX,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to the total market capitalization for the sector.
"
2788,FCX,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the differences between the size of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
2789,FCX,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.2%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
2790,FCX,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.3% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.2% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.5% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.2%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. 
"
2791,FCX,"S&P MidCap 400
"
2792,FCX,"The median firm in the S&P MidCap 400 is expected to report earnings growth of 10.88% in 2006. Estimate revision activity has been, on balance, negative over the last month with 217 estimates increased and 279 estimates cut. The story is much the same for next year with 217 estimates increased and 219 cuts over the last month.
"
2793,FCX,"Among the firms in the mid cap index showing notable estimate increases this week was Trinity Industries (TRN  -  Free Report), which makes rail cars and barges. It raised its guidance for both the second quarter and the year, citing strong demand from the railroads which are currently thriving. As a result its mean estimate for this year rose 9.13% this week (same for the month) and 5.39% for next year. For each year this was due to a single analyst raising his numbers versus no cuts. 
"
2794,FCX,"The slowdown in the housing market is affecting Ryland Group (RYL) where the mean estimate fell 1.68%% over the last week. This is a continuation of recent cuts, over the last month the mean estimate for 2006 is down 12.84%. Things are not looking very bright for next year either as the mean estimate is down 12.0%. For each year there were seven cuts and no increases.
"
2795,FCX,"S&P SmallCap 600
"
2796,FCX,"In the S&P SmallCap 600, the median firm is expected to report 12.12% growth in 2006. Over the last month there have been 181 estimates increased and 203 estimates cut for 2006 earnings. Things are similar for next year with 152 increases versus 163 cuts. Among the more significant estimate revisions was a 2.48% increase this week for Frontier Oil (FTO) reflecting the continued strength in oil prices. Over the last month, its mean estimates are up 6.74% for this year and 6.42% for next year. 
"
2797,FCX,"On the downside, small-cap homebuilders were not exempt from the pressures facing their bigger brothers. Standard Pacific (SPF) saw its estimates for this year fall 3.38% for the week and 8.68% in the month as six estimates were cut and none increased. The picture was even bleaker for next year as the mean estimate plunged 17.1% over the last month. This Week in Earnings
