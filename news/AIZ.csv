33,AIZ,"Assurant inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions lately. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised substantially 44.9% downward. For 2018, the consensus mark moved 2.4% south.  Shares of Assurant have also underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 9.5%, lagging the industry’s growth of 10.3% during the period. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of D. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.Assurant has been witnessing lower net earned premiums and other considerations over the last few years and the first three quarters of 2017 were no exception. Each quarter experienced a year-over-year decline in the same. This continues to further weigh on total revenues that have been decreasing for a while now. Assurant’s In-force policies have also been trending downward over the last several years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom-line in 2017 represent a year-over-year decline of 17.3% and 8.8%, respectively.Though the third quarter was rampaged by a series of cat events, the fourth has till date only suffered the brunt of California wildfires. Assurant estimates fourth-quarter pre-tax reportable catastrophe loss from the same between $6 million and $8 million. The company incurred a huge cat loss in the previous quarter, wherein Global Housing segment was affected the most.The above segment is estimated to be weighed on by lower mortgage originations, decrease in real estate-owned volumes and declining placement rates. Total revenues have declined nearly 19% over the last couple of years.For 2017, the company expects Global Housing’s net earned premiums and net operating income to decrease due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business, which represents lower placement rates for the second half of 2017 plus lower contributions from mortgage solutions.Assurant’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over the last few years.Return on equity (ROE) undermines a company’s growth potential. Assurant’s trailing 12-month ROE of 3.6% compares unfavorably with the ROE of 7% for the industry, reflecting that it is inefficient in using shareholder funds.Choosing the StocksWhile Assurant doesn’t appear to be an attractive pick right now, there are a few other solid stocks in the insurance space that promise greater returns. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have boiled down to three favorable stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.

34,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 net operating loss of $1.40 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.79. Also, the net operating loss in the reported quarter compared unfavorably with the net operating income of $1.00 in the year-ago quarter. Significantly higher catastrophe losses resulted in such a weak earnings performance.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteNonetheless, the company remains focused on delivering its full-year 2017 financial objectives. Also, the company anticipates its buyout of The Warranty Group to boost its opportunities to scale and enhance lifestyle offerings in 2018, while experiencing more predictable and diversified earnings as well as cash flow in the long term.Total revenues fell 7.9% year over year to $1.6 billion, mainly due to lower premiums earned. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.Net investment income improved 6.3% year over year to $132.6 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses increased 5% to $1.7 billion, mainly due to a significant increase in policyholder benefits.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model, which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments — Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 8.4% year over year to $530.3 million, primarily due to anticipated lower placements rates in lender-placed insurance as well as catastrophe premiums. Also, reduced demand for originations and field services, together with the decrease in client volumes in mortgage solutions led to this downside. However, revenue growth in multi-family housing partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating loss of $110.3 million, which compared unfavorably with the net operating income of $44.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This dismal performance was mainly attributable to the $186.8 million of catastrophe losses arising from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the Mexico City earthquake.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 9.3% year over year to $841.7 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.Net operating income of $42.6 million surged 50.5% year over year. The upside was driven by a tax benefit of $9.6 million along with growth in mobile and additional real estate joint venture partnership income.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 3.2% year over year to $44.6 million, primarily owing to growth in the United States and Canada, especially in Final Need.Net operating income declined 14.6% year over year to $12.3 million due to lower real estate joint venture investment income.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $13 million, substantially narrower than the year-ago quarter net operating loss of $17.4 million. Lower taxes and reduced corporate expenses in the reported quarter, drove this improvement.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $570 million in corporate capital as of Sep 30, 2017. Total assets rose 9.1% to $32.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $63 million in the third quarter. While share buyback totaled $34 million, dividend payout totaled $29 million.The company anticipates to complete its return of $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company has $408 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization.2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe losses) to increase on a moderate basis compared with the 2016 level. This is primarily on the back of anticipated profitable growth in fee-based, capital-light offerings (comprising Connected Living, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions) and lower net operating loss at Corporate. However, declines in lender-placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit this uptrend.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe losses) to grow in double-digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses. Further decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization, which represents lower placement rates for the second half of 2017, along with reduced contributions from mortgage solutions are anticipated to reduce the above-mentioned metric. However, expense savings and profitable growth in multi-family housing are likely to partially offset this downside.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase owing to an improved performance in Connected Living, fueled by growth in new and existing mobile programs as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies. The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue. The company anticipates revenues to fall, primarily due to a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about $500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses. This apart, the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally. However, results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its fee income and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to range between $55 million and $60 million at Corporate & Other compared with $71 million in 2016, thanks to lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced corporate expenditures.Zacks RankCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other firms from the insurance industry that have reported third-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line of The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), The Travelers Companies, Inc.

35,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.16%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterAssurant has likely witnessed a decline in net premiums earned in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business plus reduced contributions from mortgage solutions. Also, unprecedented hurricane activity will add to this downside. To that end, Assurant has projected pre-tax reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, arising from Harvey, to range between $134 million and $140 million. Such losses will impact the performance of Global Housing segment the most in the third quarter.Further, the company anticipates loss from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. However, these losses will be covered by the company’s reinsurance program.Additionally, the company has likely reported lower revenues, mainly due to lower premiums earned as well as a decline in fees and other income. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.6 billion, reflecting a noticeable decrease of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Also, the company has likely incurred higher expenses, mainly due to a rise in selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses plus interest expenses. This in turn will weigh on the Multi line insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, the company has likely experienced higher fee income and earnings at Global Preneed in the third quarter and estimates further growth in the same from this segment, fueled by sales increase across North America owing to alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Also, Assurant has probably witnessed some solid results at the Global Lifestyle segment on the back of higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living. Also, an improved performance in mobile business as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies, have possibly augured well for the company to achieve good results in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Assurant has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of $1.79.

QuoteZacks Rank: Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are as follows:Ares Capital Corporation (ARCC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 2 with an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.

36,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 net operating income of $2 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. Also, the bottom line improved 6.9% from the year-ago period. Lower effective tax rate owing to the tax cut and decent underlying profitable growth in key businesses like mobile business and multi-family housing, drove this improvement. However, higher level of net operating loss at the Corporate segment and a substantial catastrophe loss in Global Housing, partially offset this upside.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. Quote Total revenues improved 7.2% year over year to $1.6 billion, mainly attributable to higher premiums earned, fees and other income as well as net investment income. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.2%.Net investment income improved nearly 8% year over year to $130.2 million.Total benefits, loss and expenses increased 12.4% to $1.5 billion, mainly due to a substantial increase in policyholder benefits, selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing slid about 1.6% year over year to $523.1 million, primarily due to lower placement rates as well as real-estate owned volume in lender placed insurance plus reduction in client demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions. However, sustained growth in multi-family housing and higher contributions from international housing products partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating income of $71.2 million, which increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. This improvement was mainly attributable to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.  Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle improved 14.1% year over year to $918.5 million. This benefit was primarily driven by growth in new and existing mobile protection programs as well as vehicle protection. However, a decline in mobile trade-in volumes partially offset the upside.Net operating income of $55.8 million rose 6.5% year over year. The upside was driven by the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 4.5% year over year to $46.2 million, primarily owing to growth in the United States including prior period sales of the Final Need product.Net operating income slipped 1% year over year to $9.8 million, mainly due to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $20 million, substantially wider than the year-ago quarter’s net operating loss of $10.1 million. Increases in employee-related costs from the year-earlier quarter along with the adverse impact of the reduced effective tax rate were responsible for this downside.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $575 million in corporate capital as of Mar 31, 2018. Total assets rose 1.8% to $32.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018 from $31.8 billion at year-end 2017.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company did not buy back any shares in the quarter under review.The company’s total dividends amounted to $30 million in the first quarter.2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe loss) to grow between 10% and 14% from the reported results of $413 million in 2017. The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and a considerable rise in underlying segment earnings (while adjusting for $12.5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items). Declines in lender-placed insurance and credit insurance are likely to be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi-family housing as well as vehicle protection.Notably, with the sanction of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), Assurant’s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22-23% from 33% with nearly one-third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe loss) to grow in excess of net operating income, representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate, moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Further, the company expects to witness a decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and mortgage solutions. However, continued growth in multi-family housing is likely to partially offset this downside. Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019. Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20-21% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth. Revenues are projected to be close to 2017-levels as decrease in lender-placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as vehicle protection expansion and expense efficiencies. The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside. Lower effective tax rate of 22-24% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results. Moreover, the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection, globally.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Lower effective tax rate of about 22% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is estimated to enhance results.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to be close to 2017’s loss of $63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate & Other. The loss will likely increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20%.Dividends from the units, namely Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to be higher than the net operating income (including catastrophe loss) owing to the implementation of TCJA.   Zacks RankAssurant carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other players from the insurance industry having already reported first-quarter earnings, the bottom line of The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report), MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp. (RLI  -  Free Report) surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

38,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3 after the market closes. The company delivered a positive surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 16.3%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Assurant’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have been driven by a strong performance across most of its business lines.Growth in mobile business as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies possibly have augmented operating income at Connected Living. However, declines in lender-placed and credit insurance are likely to have been a partial offset. Growth at vehicle protection business has been driven by sturdy sales made earlier.Global Lifestyle largely benefited from higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs in fourth-quarter 2017. However, the company does not expect any increase in trade-in volumes during the first quarter 2018. This is because sales of new smartphones have been lower than expected. Nonetheless, a compelling product and client mix are expected to have aided Global Lifestyle’s performance.Revenues and earnings at Global Preneed have probably been driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. A lower tax rate will boost its performance.However, the company estimates lender-placed declines in its Global Housing.Lower tax incidence owing to a drop in the tax rate will possibly cushion the bottom line. Also, continued share buybacks should have upped the metric. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.89 per share, up 1.1% year over year.What the Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat on earnings this to-be-reported quarter.

41,AIZ,"New analyst coverage unearths extensive data on stocks for investors. Analysts are privy to vital information which is crucial for investment decisions. Lack of information creates chances of misinterpretation of stocks (over or undervalued).Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst(s) usually portrays higher investor inclination. Investors, on their part, often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it. In other words, they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value.Obviously, stocks are not randomly chosen to cover. New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst(s). At times, increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it. After all, who doesn’t like to produce something that is already in demand? Hence, we often find that analysts’ ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks.Needless to say, the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change.Impact on Stock PriceThe price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts. Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage. Positive recommendations — Buy and Strong Buy — generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations. On the contrary, analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation.Now, if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage, investors start paying more attention to it. Also, any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock.So, it’s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks.Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago (This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage).Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago ('Less than' means 'better than' four weeks ago).Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof.Here are the other screening parameters:Price greater than or equal to $5 (as a stock below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors).Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares (if volume isn’t enough, it will not attract individual investors).Here are five of the seven stocks that passed the screen:Heritage Commerce Corp. (HTBK  -  Free Report) is a holding company of Heritage Bank of Commerce, Heritage Bank East Bay, Heritage Bank South Valley and Bank of Los Altos.

42,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 net operating income of $1.84 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.5%. Also, the figure skyrocketed 300% from the year-ago period. Lower reportable catastrophe loss and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses in Global Housing, drove this improvement.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. Quote The company remains optimistic on building a strong foundation in 2018 with the closing of its buyout of The Warranty Group and leveraging the company’s expanded scale and experience in key Housing and Lifestyle markets in order to achieve sustainable long-term, profitable growth.Total revenues declined 2.8% year over year to $1.7 billion, mainly due to lower premiums earned, fees and other income plus net investment income. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%.Net investment income deteriorated 12.2% year over year to $118.6 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased 10.6% to $1.5 billion, mainly owing to a substantial decline in policyholder benefits as well as selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses.Full-Year HighlightsFor 2017, Assurant reported net operating income per share of $3.98, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.6% but deteriorating 10.9% year over year.Total revenues of $6.3 billion fell 9.6% year over year.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model, which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments — Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 1.5% year over year to $562.8 million, primarily due to anticipated lower lender-placed insurance revenue, net of reduced catastrophe premiums. Also, reduced demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions led to this downside. However, growth in multi-family housing and revenues from new lender-placed loans onboarded in 2017, partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating income of $89.6 million, which skyrocketed 729.6% from the year-ago quarter. This stellar performance was mainly attributable to lower reportable catastrophes and the absence of lender-placed regulatory expenses compared with the prior-year quarter.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle slipped 1.7% year over year to $913.6 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in this particular segment.Net operating income of $42.8 million increased 23.7% year over year. The upside was driven by higher contributions from Connected Living, fueled by global mobile programs including a $5 million client recoverable and growth from vehicle protection. However, results were partially offset by declines in credit insurance.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 9% year over year to $45.9 million, primarily owing to growth in Canada along with realization of revenues from prior period sales of the Final Need product in the United States.Net operating income plunged 57.8% year over year to $4.6 million, mainly due to a software impairment worth $5 million.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $29.1 million, substantially wider than the year-ago quarter’s net operating loss of $20.3 million. Lower net investment income and a charge related to workforce reductions, worth $4.6 million, were responsible for the deterioration.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $540 million in corporate capital as of Dec 31, 2017. Total assets rose 7.2% to $31.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2017 from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $169 million in the fourth quarter. While share buyback totaled $139 million, dividend payout totaled $30 million.The company has $293.4 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization.2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe loss) to grow between 10% and 14% from the reported results of $412 million in 2017. The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and considerable rise in underlying segment earnings (while adjusting for $12.5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items). Declines in lender-placed insurance and credit insurance might be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi-family housing as well as vehicle protection.Notably, with the sanction of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Assurant’s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22-23% from 33% with nearly one-third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe loss) to grow in excess of net operating income, representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate, moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Further, decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization is anticipated as the housing market continues to improve. However, continued growth in multi-family housing and better performance in mortgage solutions are likely to partially offset this downside. Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019. Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20%. Revenues are projected to be close to 2017 levels as decrease in lender-placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection as well as expense efficiencies. The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside. Lower effective tax rate with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results. Moreover, the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection, globally.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Lower effective tax rate with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to be close to 2017’s loss of $63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate & Other. The loss will increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20%.Zacks RankAssurant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

43,AIZ,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing, with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues.

Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry Sneak PeekThe insurance industry, as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third quarter. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Feb 8.American International Group Inc.

44,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7 after the market closes. The company delivered a positive surprise in all the trailing four quarters of 2017 with an average beat of +16.3%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Results at Global Housing segment in the fourth quarter are likely to be weighed on by cat loss, stemming from California wildfires. Assurant estimates fourth-quarter pretax cat loss between $6 million and $8 million. Nonetheless, the company expects placement rate that declined in the third quarter to moderate in the quarter to be reported. However, net earned premiums and earnings are expected to have decreased in the period, attributable to ongoing normalization of lender-placed and soft performance in mortgage solutions. For 2017, the company anticipates Global Housing’s net earned premiums and net operating income to fall due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business.A combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies has likely aided Global Lifestyle segment’s earnings growth and margin expansion. Growth in the wireless and automotive business is projected to have fueled domestic revenues.Growth in mobile business as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies possibly has augmented operating income at Connected Living.The company is likely to have benefited from growth in its fee-based capital-light offerings and lower loss at Corporate segment, partially offset by sluggish performance at lender-placed and legacy businesses. It expects net operating loss at Corporate segment between $55 million to $60 million, lower than the level in 2016.Share buyback should boost the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.58 per share, up 243.5% year over year.The company anticipates operating earnings (excluding catastrophe loss) in 2017 to increase from the year-ago level.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

46,AIZ,"XL Group Ltd. (XL  -  Free Report) has recently announced catastrophe loss estimates of approximately $1.33 billion, emanating from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Total catastrophe losses, including smaller loss events, is estimated at about $1.48 billion pre-tax or $1.35 billion post tax. These estimates are within the company’s expectations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has also changed to a loss of $4.23 per share against the year-ago earnings of 42 cents per share.  The estimate has been revised down over the last 30 days. The company is set to release third-quarter earnings results on Oct 24.However, our proven model cannot conclusively state if the company is likely to beat estimates this time. Thisis because XL Group’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lower the predictive power of an earnings beat, when combined with a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes prediction difficult.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Nonetheless, the insurer has a track of delivering positive surprise in the last five quarter.Being a property and casualty insurer the company has been prone to suffering losses owing to catastrophe events. Catastrophe pre-tax losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums for the second-quarter 2017 was $92.1 million compared with $240.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s underwriting profit for the first-half 2017 was $338.6 million which grew 22.1% year over year.The P&C insurer will not be able to evade the aftermath of such catastrophe events, which in turn poses a serious threat to weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. While hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria each contributed to the company’s loss estimates by 25%, 40% and 25%, respectively, 10% of such estimates is attributable to Mexican earthquakes and Typhoon Hato. The loss will however be borne equally by Insurance and Reinsurance segments.Challenged by these natural calamities, the company continues to have significant catastrophe reinsurance protections for 2017 and 2018, including catastrophe bond protections, some of which will extend through 2019.A catastrophe loss materially reduces profitability, thereby affecting the companies’ finances. Being a property and casualty insurer, XL Group will not escape the disaster caused by such catastrophe events. However, banking on its strong capital position and  expert team,the company remains well positioned in addressing the challenges or risks faced by its clients and brokers.Share Price MovementShares of the company have underperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has gained 9.6%, the industry has rallied 12.3%. We expect its diversified product offerings fueling higher premiums to drive the stock higher in the future. Other Cat Loss EstimatesOther insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. The Navigators Group, Inc (NAVG  -  Free Report) anticipates incurring pre-tax catastrophe loss of $50-$70 million ($33-$45 million after tax) in the third quarter. W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) has recently projected a catastrophe loss of about $110 million, which translates to $72 million after tax. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pretax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

47,AIZ,"Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates, originating from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $503 million, net of reinstatement premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $7.02 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 25.4%. We expect estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.Being a property and casualty insurer, Markel will bear the brunt of the disaster caused by these catastrophe events, weighing on its underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, the company’s underwriting profit has been improving over the years owing to its niche focus, effective management of insurance risk and focus on developing and maintaining underwriting as well as pricing guidelines on existing products and new product development.Notably, the company’s combined ratio has been better than the industry average over the last five years through 2016, though the same deteriorated 500 basis points in the first half of 2017 due to less favorable development on prior-year loss reserves.Irrespective of catastrophe alleviating techniques, severe blows from weather-related calamities make earnings unstable and hazardous. Nonetheless, Markel is capable of meeting insurance claims, courtesy a sturdy balance sheet.Shares of Markel have rallied 20.8% year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 12.3%. Strong operational results driven by insurance, investments and Markel ventures should continue to drive shares.Markel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

48,AIZ,"Shares of The Navigators Group, Inc. (NAVG  -  Free Report) have slid 1.8% in the last three trading sessions after the company announced expected catastrophe loss estimates emanating from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican tremors. The company anticipates to incur catastrophe loss of $50-$70 million pre-tax ($33-$45 million after-tax) in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.1%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.Despite challenging market conditions, in 2016, the company had delivered underwriting profits for the fifth year with a combined ratio of 96.7%. However, underwriting profit plunged 38.2% compared with 2015 as the International Insurance underwriting segment was adversely affected by North American exposures underwritten at Lloyd’s. The recent catastrophe events are expected to weigh heavily on the company’s underwriting income, draining its margins in the process.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation rampaged parts of the United States, which again bore the brunt of a slew of hurricanes and ravages of successive tremors.While Harvey shook Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran roughshod in regions across the Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the deadliest in a decade. No sooner than the country had experienced a breather with Hurricane Jose not turning as destructive as expected than another hurricane Maria happened to hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.A catastrophe loss materially reduces profitability, thereby affecting the companies’ finances. Being a property and casualty insurer, The Navigators Group will not escape the disaster caused by such catastrophe events. Irrespective of the techniques deployed by the company to ease catastrophes, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates.

49,AIZ,"Multi-line insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion ($1.9 billion to $2.0 billion after-tax), net of reinsurance, in the third quarter.The loss is related to hurricanes Harvey ($1.1 billion to $1.2 billion), Irma ($1 billion to $1.1 billion) and Maria ($600 million to $700 million). The Mexico earthquake is estimated to cause $150 million of loss.The loss will be incurred in the company’s Commercial segment, which benefited in the previous quarter from low catastrophe loss.We expect the segment’s profitability to suffer in the third quarter from high loss claims at a time when the segment’s top line is already weighed down by challenging market conditions.Year to date, the stock has lost 5.4%, underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 7.2%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which continued to be ravaged by a number of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed as a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean between $ 40 billion and $85 billion.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Hurricane Irma.On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

50,AIZ,"W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) has recently announced estimated catastrophe loss estimates erupting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in Mexico. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $110 million, which translates to $72 million after-tax. Shares of the company have slid 0.2% in the last two trading sessions following the announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 37 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 58.4%. We expect the estimates to move south as analysts incorporate the catastrophe loss impact.Catastrophe losses have traditionally had a significant impact on the company’s results. In 2016, the company incurred cat losses of $105.1 million, which were 82.5% wider than 2015. However, in the first half of 2017, the company witnessed a much lower level of weather-related losses, due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. Catastrophe loss came in at $47.5 million, a substantial decline of 15.5% compared with the first half of 2016. The recent cat loss will further escalate claim losses, thereby draining margins.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma hit regions spanning across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner had the country heaved a sigh of relief — with Hurricane Jose not turning as destructive as anticipated — than another hurricane Maria, happened to strike Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the estimate for insured losses from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. The Mexican tremors will cost the insurance industry billions, per the same catastrophe risk modeler.Being a property and casualty insurer, W.R. Berkley will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events, weighing on the underwriting profitability in the process. Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax.

51,AIZ,"RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $625 million (net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums) in the third quarter.The loss will emanate mainly from hurricanes Harvey ($225 million) and Irma ($175 million). The Mexico earthquake and hurricane Maria, together, will cause $225 million of losses.   The loss is expected to weigh on the company’s combined ratio. The company incurred 14% year-over-year higher claim expenses of $0.34 million in the first half of 2017. The recent cat loss will further amplify claim loss, draining margins.A meaningful portion of reinsurance and insurance written by the company provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. So its results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, and the coverages offered.The company continues to suffer from soft pricing in the reinsurance market, which has been continuing for the last seven years now. Year to date, the stock has gained a mere 1.2%, vastly underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 11.4%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which was ravaged by a trio of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across the Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner had the country heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed as a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion, as per Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry-insured losses for Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean between $ 40 billion and $85 billion.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimates $200 million post-tax cat losses from Maria, $24 million from Mexican earthquakes, $520 million from Harvey and between $640 million and $760 million from Irma.On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning around the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.RenaissanceRe carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

52,AIZ,"American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates stemming from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria and two Mexican tremors. The company projects catastrophe loss of about $105 million or 95 cents per share post-tax.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.62 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses.To offset the loss effect, American Financial maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage. It includes $15 million per occurrence net retention for property and casualty operations. Additionally, it maintains supplemental fully collateralized reinsurance coverage up to 95% of $200 million for catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million of traditional catastrophe reinsurance via a catastrophe bond.Being a property and casualty insurer, American Financial will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events. The company’s earnings have traditionally been affected by inclement weather conditions. Even drought, which does not otherwise qualify as a calamity, had impacted the company’s earnings.Irrespective of catastrophe mitigation techniques deployed by the company, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile. Nonetheless, American Financial has a track of generating combined ratio better than the industry for 26 of the last 28 years.Shares of American Financial have gained 4.1% in the third quarter, thereby marginally underperforming the industry’s increase of 5.9%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 earnings being revised 3.6% downward over the last 60 days.

57,AIZ,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 27, 272 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of these companies account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization.Total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% rise in revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings per share estimates and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.The insurance industry, an integral part of the the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), will witness soft results in the third quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our report, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 2.9% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect insurance pricings to be strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy of three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though the rate environment is advancing at snail’s pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continued low rates. Annuity sales should also benefit from higher rates.However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of four multiline insurance stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Nov 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico. A lower amount of share buyback would also hurt its bottom line.We expect to see earnings strength in its Consumer segment as the company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets.Our proven model shows that AIG does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 — to beat earnings estimates.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is 15.7 million, up 3.5% year over year.Increased revenues from Global Supplemental Business are likely on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent.

Estimated gross catastrophe losses, excluding homeowners’ flood, are $576 million, stemming from Hurricane Harvey.The company expects reinsurance recoveries to reduce the number by $23 million. About 55% of the catastrophe losses were related to auto coverage. Allstate added that about $53 million estimated losses and expenses from commercial insurance, auto-protection contracts and loss-adjusting expenses were not covered by reinsurance.Allstate is yet to estimate catastrophe loss from Hurricane Irma that hit regions spanning Caribbean to Florida in September. In July 2017, Allstate had estimated to have incurred pretax catastrophe losses of $181 million or $118 million after tax attributable to 13 catastrophic events that took place in June.

HCI Group, Inc.

These have weighed on the company’s claims and benefits, expenses, and cash flow, draining its underwriting profitability. However, the company is making efforts to lower losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. It is also limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets by raising premiums. This may lead to a decline in the number of policies in force.Zacks Rank & Share Price Impact The Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time.

59,AIZ,"After providing loss estimates from the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has come up with loss estimates due to Hurricane Maria and two Mexican earthquakes. The insurer projects $220 million pre-tax or $200 million post-tax losses from Maria.These losses are net of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums. Pre-tax losses of $152 million or $135 million after-tax will drag Chubb’s commercial and personal property as well as casualty insurance operations. Reinsurance businesses will be hurt by $53 million loss. Despite the deficit, the estimated reinstatement premiums are pegged at an extra $15 million pre-tax.With respect to Mexican earthquakes that struck in September, the company expects to incur insured losses of $25 million pre-tax or $24 million post-tax, plus net of reinsurance and inclusion of reinstatement premiums.Chubb also anticipates to have incurred a catastrophe loss of about $107 million pre-tax or $86 million after-tax from all other damages for which, it had not yet provided any estimates.Recently, Chubb has calculated losses amounting to $650 million pre-tax or $520 million post- tax from Harvey, while the same from Irma is expected to be between $800 million and $950 million pre-tax or $640 million and $760 million after-tax. Per Moody’s Analytics, economic losses from Irma are estimated at $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion.Being an insurer, Chubb could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Despite catastrophe losses, expense efficiencies from the merger and impressive combined ratios helped Chubb generate strong underwriting profitability through the last two reported quarters.Shares of Chubb have lost 1.9% in the third quarter, underperforming the industry’s increase of 5.9%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised downward 21.7% while the same for 2018 has slid 0.4% in the last 30 days.

60,AIZ,"Specialty insurer ProAssurance Corporation (PRA  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $7.5 million (net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums) for the third quarter.These losses are from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which created havoc in Texas, several states in the southeast United States and islands in the Caribbean.The loss will be incurred in the company’s Lloyds Syndicate segment (which contributed nearly 7% of the gross premium in the first half of 2017) and is attributed to its 58% participation in business written by Lloyd's Syndicate 1729.The expected loss is likely to weigh on the segment’s loss ratio, which deteriorated 1320 basis points year over year in the first six months of 2017. The segment reported a 11.4% increase in revenues in the first half of 2017.Year to date, the stock has lost 2.1%, underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 10.7%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which continued to be ravaged by a trio of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.ProAssurance carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

61,AIZ,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) has evaluated pre-tax catastrophe loss stemming from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as earthquakes in Mexico. Loss from Harvey is projected to be $650 million pre-tax or $520 million after tax. Loss from Irma is anticipated to be between $800 million and $950 million pre-tax or $640 million and $760 million after tax.These losses are net of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums and are attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the third quarter is currently pegged at 46 cents per share, plummeting 84.1% year over year. We expect this estimate to move further south as analysts incorporate the catastrophe loss impact.Being a property and casualty insurer, Chubb could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results.

63,AIZ,"Property and casualty insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $593 million pretax ($385 million after tax) for the month of August 2017.The loss may be attributed to six events from Hurricane Harvey. While these losses will cost $591 million pretax, the company expects to incur the remaining $2 million from the prior-period adverse reserve reestimate.Allstate also expects to incur nearly $181 million, pre-tax ($118 million after-tax), in estimated catastrophe losses for the month of July 2017.Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the company that have and will continue to result in material year-to-year fluctuations in its results and financial position. In the first six months of 2017, Allstate incurred cat loss of $1.75 billion, down 2.2% year over year.The company might incur additional loss from hurricane Irma that occurred this month.In order to mitigate weather-related losses, Allstate is focusing on catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. Despite these efforts, we cannot rule out the possibility of losses from catastrophes and severe weather incidents, going forward.Nevertheless, shares of Allstate have been rising steadily year to date, generating returns of 22%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.7%.The outperformance reflects optimism surrounding the stock from initiatives taken by the company such as profit-improvement plans in its auto business, which suffered high auto claims for the past many quarters. Efforts to diversify its business and product offerings at a time when some of its business lines are subjects of friction have also been viewed favorably by investors.  There seems no end to woes and mass devastation as parts of the United States continue to be rampaged by a host of Hurricanes hitting one after another.

No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed to a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics.

64,AIZ,"There seems no end to the woes and mass devastations as parts of the United States continue to be rampaged by a host of Hurricanes. While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in the regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief as Hurricane Jose was not so destructive in effect than another Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed to a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Loss counts are yet to come for the damages caused by Maria. The only good news is that Irma’s impact is projected as lower than anticipated.We can safely say that the third quarter of property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by Hurricanes, disrupting the results of insurers in the process. Continuous damages can even induce underwriting loss, resulting in major deterioration in combined ratio in the third quarter of 2017. Third-quarter earnings will therefore be badly affected.Insurers have already started releasing loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. The insurer stated that this loss will impact the third-quarter performance of its Global Housing segment the most.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. In fact, in the wake of such a grave loss, the insurer halted its share repurchase program. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Hurricane Irma. HCI Group also anticipated the extent of loss to exceed its $16 million reinsurance retention level.Insurers need to be prepared with enough funds to address huge claims arising due to calamities. The main challenge lies in settling claims smoothly without affecting their own financials. Due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, the insurers could build reserves over the last several quarters. We expect such capital accumulation to help insurers meet the claims and yet at the same time, save them from buckling under the burden.  The industry is currently ranked at #206, representing the bottom 8% of the Zacks Industry Ranks. The industry has also underperformed the S&P 500 over the last month.

We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate the impact of the catastrophe loss.HCI Group has been bracing its operations with strategic initiatives.

66,AIZ,"The two most important factors concerning the insurance industry are impact of two catastrophe events and uncertainty over the next rate hike.The third-quarter results of non-life insurers will be hurt by the two hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — that rampaged Houston, Texas Gulf Coast and regions ranging from Caribbean to Florida. Losses from these catastrophes will surely upset the underwriting results dragging the bottom line.While The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax, Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) projects between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums resulting from the Harvey tropical storm. Assurant also projects loss from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax.However, there is still a faint ray of hope to harp on. For such catastrophes will help insurer increase price that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. Also, cautious underwriting should help insurers from capital erosion.The cloud of uncertainty regarding the next rate hike makes investors eagerly wait for the upcoming FOMC Meeting on Sep 19. While the Federal Reserve has already hiked rates twice in 2017, everybody now eagerly awaits the third one. Good news is that the Fed announced intention for three rate hikes in 2017. However, at the annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole, WY on Aug 25, no hints were dropped about the next hike in interest. In fact, lack of signals about the announcement of the next rate hike was interpreted as ‘dovish’ by the markets.Benefits of improving rates could already be seen in insurers’ results.  Progressing economy, encouraging employment data, stringent underwriting standards as well as influx of capital instill confidence among investors.Assured PicksIt’s every investor’s wish to invest in stocks that are currently undervalued but have great growth potential. Value investors always look to put money in stocks that tend to trade at a lower price or the value is lower than the intrinsic one whereas, growth investors look for stocks with earnings increase relatively better than the market. Therefore growth investors ideally search for value stocks to reap better returns.It’s a daunting task to zero in on stocks, currently undervalued yet with high-growth offer. Here comes our Zacks Rank and  Style Scores that help identify such stocks. Back-tested results have shown stocks with Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.We take Value Score and Growth Score of A or B and Buy-ranked stocks to select such stocks.Florida-based Health Insurance Innovations, Inc.

67,AIZ,"Assurant Inc.

The loss will impact the third-quarter performance of its Global Housing segment the most. In fact, the segment has already been facing headwinds regarding lender-places business. The company is realigning business with an eye on higher growth returns. We expect the outcomes to remain depressed as the segment’s performance is hampered by the catastrophe.With respect to Hurricane Irma, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer expects loss to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. However, the same will be covered by its reinsurance program. This July, Assurant announced a $1.36 billion 2017 property catastrophe reinsurance program, intended to lower the company’s risk and financial exposure, thereby augmenting financial capabilities.The reinsurance coverage comprises $1.03 billion for the U.S. catastrophe loss and $0.33 billion for the International segment. Within the program, Assurant will cover $100 million loss while reinsure 90% of $324 million loss from its Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. The International per-occurrence catastrophe coverage for Caribbean region is $152.5 million. These will likely cushion the company’s third-quarter results.Assurant stated to maintain strong surplus levels in insurance companies. It boasts a solid capital position with $625 million of capital as of Jun 30, 2017.Assurant had also experienced catastrophe losses from Louisiana floods in the year-ago quarter. Catastrophe losses were $33 million in third-quarter 2016 compared with none in third- quarter 2015.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.45 per share, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 45%.

68,AIZ,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) recently announced pre-tax catastrophe loss estimates stemming from Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas on Aug 25, 2017. The company projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax.Travelers being a property and casualty insurer will not escape the disaster caused by these catastrophe events since its underwriting results have severely taken a beating. The company has been witnessing high level of catastrophe losses for a considerable period of time. Notably, the last quarter marked the maximum catastrophe losses since 2011. However, this statistic might change once the damages from both the storms are estimated.In the year-ago quarter too, Travelers experienced catastrophe losses resulting from hail storms in the Western region of the United States and floods in the Southeast region of the United States. Catastrophe losses of $89 million weighed on underwriting gains that slumped 46% and combined ratio deteriorating 330 basis points year over year.On a positive note, shares of Travelers have gained 2.3% in yesterday’s trading session, the first trading day after Hurricane Irma struck Florida over the weekend. Satisfactory news is that the narrower-than-expected damage caused by Irma has likely helped Travelers from not losing in the session.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.77 per share, translating to a year-over-year plunge of 26.1%. We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate the impact of the catastrophe loss.Concurrently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) property and casualty insurer has also announced to halt its share repurchase program in the wake of the catastrophe activities as part of capital management strategy during a considerable catastrophic environment.

70,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc.’s (AIZ  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 net operating income of $1.63 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Also, the bottom line improved 14.8% from $1.42 per share earned in the year-ago quarter.Lower Corporate and other expenses resulted in the improvement. However, lower contributions from Global Lifestyle, driven by an absence of $18 million one-time tax benefit in the year-ago quarter, partially offset this upside. Notably, the company did not incur any reportable catastrophe loss in the second quarter, in comparison to $16 million of the same in the prior-year quarter.Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteTotal revenue fell 5.2% year over year to $1.56 billion due to lower premiums earned as well as a decline in fees and other income. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 billion by 2.4%.Net investment income improved 1.6% year over year to $121.7 million.Total benefits, losses and expenses declined about 9% to $1.4 billion, mainly due to a significant decline in selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses plus interest expenses.Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model which supported its multi-year transformation. As of fourth-quarter 2016, Assurant reported through four segments – Global Housing (formerly known as the Assurant Specialty), Global Lifestyle (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions), Global Preneed (formerly included in the Assurant Solutions) and Corporate & Other.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing fell about 2% year over year to $550.2 million, primarily due to anticipated lower placements rates in lender-placed insurance as well as reduced demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions. However, growth in multi-family housing as well as new client revenues in lender-placed insurance partially offset this downside.Net operating income dipped about 1.2% year over year to $56.2 million. The ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and higher non-catastrophe losses led to the downside.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 8.6% year over year to $836.0 million. This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.Net operating income of $40.2 million plunged 19.8% year over year. The downside was driven by a one-time tax benefit of $18 million in the prior-year quarter.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 6.9% year over year to $46.3 million, primarily due to expanded volumes in Canada.Net operating income climbed 13.3% year over year to $12.8 million, mainly driven by higher fees and investment income. Higher expenses partially offset this upside.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $10.6 million, substantially narrower than the year-ago quarter net operating loss of $19.4 million. Lower taxes and fees associated with Assurant Employee Benefits (sold in Mar 2016) as well as reduced corporate expenses in the reported quarter, drove the improvement.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $625 million in corporate capital as of Jun 30, 2017. Total assets inched up 1.2% to $30.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, from $29.7 billion at year-end 2016.Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company’s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to $142 million in the second quarter. While share buyback totaled $112 million, dividend payout totaled $30 million.The company spent about $25 million to repurchase an additional 0.2 million shares from Jul 1 through Jul 28, 2017. It now has $442 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization.2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe losses) to remain flat with the 2016 level. This is primarily due to the anticipated profitable growth in fee-based, capital-light offerings (comprising Connected Living, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions) and lower net operating loss at Corporate. However, declines in lender-placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit this uptrend.Assurant projects operating earnings per diluted share (excluding catastrophe losses) to grow in double-digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses. The ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and reduced contributions from mortgage solutions are anticipated to decrease the above-mentioned metric. However, expense savings and profitable growth in multi-family housing is likely to partially offset this downside.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase due to an improved performance in Connected Living, fueled by mobile as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies. The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue. The company anticipates revenues to fall, primarily owing to a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about $500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses. This apart, the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally. However, results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its fee income and earnings, mainly due to sales growth across North America due to the company’s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies.Assurant expects a full-year net operating loss of about $60 million at Corporate & Other compared with $71 million in 2016, mainly due to lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced corporate expenditures.Zacks RankCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong other players from the insurance industry that have reported their second-quarter earnings so far, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) as well as The Travelers Companies, Inc’s.

71,AIZ,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered this QuarterAssurant is likely to report bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, primarily driven by one-time client recoverables and an improved extended service contract profitability in Global Lifestyle. The Multi line insurer also anticipates its total operating earnings (excluding catastrophe losses) to be somewhat in level with that of 2016, with operating earnings per share estimated to increase in double digits.The company has likely experienced higher fee income and earnings at Preneed in the second quarter and further estimates growth in the same from this segment, fueled by increased production across North America as well as operational efficiencies.Assurant has probably witnessed some solid results at the Global Lifestyle segment, owing to higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living. Also, an improved performance in mobile business has possibly augured well for the company to achieve good results in second quarter.Additionally, Assurant’s fee-based capital-light businesses are expected to display growth in the to-be-reported quarter, which will be a key driver of return on equity (ROE) expansion by 2020.However, the Multi line insurer has likely witnessed weaker results at Mortgage solutions, due to lower than expected demand.Also, the company might have experienced lower premiums earned in the quarter, which is again anticipated to have weighed on revenue improvement.Furthermore, Assurant’s Global Housing segment has likely displayed lower net earned premiums and earnings in the second quarter. The company anticipates continued declines in this segment for the full-year 2017.With respect to the surprise trend, Assurant delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.82%.Assurant, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Assurant, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Assurant, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

Delinquent inventory decreased 12.8% year over year to 36,037.MGIC Investment has been severely hit by the financial crisis in 2008.  Nonetheless, the company has been witnessing improvement in new business written owing to strengthening of purchase mortgage market, improving persistency and the company’s growing market share (measured by new insurance written).

77,AIZ,"A favorable operating environment has set the stage for insurers to perform well through the second half of 2018. Though macro factors like interest rate hike, trade tariffs, rise in oil prices and inflation rate should continue to render volatility in markets and sectors, the insurance industry is expected to push limits, banking on inherent strength cushioned by a beneficial operating environment.Driving ForcesStrengthening of the U.S. economy has propelled the Federal Reserve raise rate from its near-zero level. In its June meeting, Federal funds rate was projected at 2.4% for 2018. Though insurers have lowered their exposure to rate sensitive instrument, yet given the accelerated pace of rate hikes, they stand to benefit.Employment statistics instill optimism as a solid labor market reflecting lower unemployment level and higher wages increases the disposable income, thus widening scope for more policy writings. Fed officials anticipate a 3.8% unemployment rate while GDP is expected to grow 2.7% in 2018.Also, increased frequency of catastrophe events has impelled an increase in coverage policies.The tax rate overhaul, amounting to $1.5-trillion lower tax burden, slashed the rate to 21% from 35%. A lower tax incidence broadens chances of effective capital deployment as well as margin expansion. Insures have already started to see benefits of this lower tax incidence.  The first half of 2018 escaped the brutal blows of nature but given the unprecedented nature of catastrophes, none is sure what lies ahead. The second half of 2017 witnessed the merciless wrath of nature turning the year into the costliest phase in terms of catastrophe loss. While Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in August, Irma and Maria devastated parts of the United States in September. And further adding to the woes, were two consecutive earthquakes in Mexico in September. Also, there were California wildfires during October affecting many.Catastrophic occurrences weigh on insurers’ underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, price hikes by the industry players following a series of cat events, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and taking reinsurance covers should help insurers withstand the deficits.While greater demand for insurance (particularly with the emergence of new insurable risks including cyber threats) will keep the business of P&C insurers afloat, their willingness to negotiate on policy terms and ample capital strength will intensify the competition for grabbing a sizeable market share in the quarters ahead.Given an all-time high capital level, mergers and acquisitions are arresting attention of late. While these should help curb competition, consolidations should enhance insurers’ portfolio.Robust reserves, all-time high capital level, focus to boost the top line while improving the bottom line should help insurers emerge winners going ahead.Stocks Trading CheapYear to date, the insurance industry has declined 6.9% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.6%.However, given a favorable operating backdrop and solid fundamentals of the industry, it seems apt to add insurance stocks to investors’ portfolio now as the valuation looks cheap now. Price-to-book ratio (P/BV), the most appropriate multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, is 2.15, lower than the S&P 500 index’s 3.85 as well as the Finance sector’s reading of 2.47.Stocks to Add to PortfolioWith the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted an array of insurance stocks with a bullish Zacks Rank supported by upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days and an impressive Value Score of A or B. Value Score helps identify companies that are undervalued. This deviation from their fair value is what creates an exceptional upside opportunity.

82,AIZ,"President Trump has upped the ante against China in a standoff, which is fast developing into a full-fledged trade war. On the evening of Jun 18, he threatened to impose tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, escalating trade tensions. China responded strongly on the morning of Jun 19, promising to retaliate if such tariffs indeed come into effect.Meanwhile, the Dow logged its fifth straight daily decline on Jun 18 as investors remained jittery over the standoff between the two countries. Since these events could drastically dent investor confidence, picking value stocks with low-beta looks like a smart option at this point.Beta measures the tendency of a stock's returns to respond to market swings. Low correlation stocks provide protection during turbulent times as they are less prone to day-to-day fluctuations.Additional Tariffs in the Offing, China to RetaliateOn the evening of Jun 18, Trump said that he has asked the U.S. Trade Representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on which additional tariffs of 10% could be imposed. These tariffs would be enforced “if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced.”In the event that China chooses to retaliate, tariffs would be levied on another $200 billion of goods. China issued a strong response to this statement on the morning of Jun 19, characterizing the move as “extreme pressure and blackmail.” The country’s Commerce Ministry has promised to adopt “quantitative and qualitative measures and retaliate forcefully” in case the United States goes ahead with its decision.Trump Slaps Tariffs, China Strikes BackThis fresh exchange comes almost immediately after the two countries had imposed retaliatory tariffs on each other. On Jun 15, President Trump announced that the United States is imposing tariffs on $50 billion of China’s imports. Also, he said that the United States “will pursue additional tariffs” in case China pursues retaliatory measures.On Jun 16, China’s finance ministry stated that it will launch tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of U.S. imports. Tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. imports, primarily on agricultural goods, will commence from Jul 6.  (Read: 6 Defensive Stocks to Buy as Trade Tensions Flare Up)Our ChoicesTrade tensions between the United States and China have undergone further escalation after Trump’s recent proclamation.

83,AIZ,"Estimates for Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) have been revised upward over the past 60 days, buoying analysts’ optimism on the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 0.7% and 0.3% to $4.52 and $5, respectively.As a provider of life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds and investment management products and services, Prudential boasts a rich history of 140 years of operations. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) financial services leader have soared nearly 46.4%, outperforming the industry's surge of 38.6% over the last couple of years.  Let’s focus on the factors that make Prudential a wealthy choice for fetching fat returns to investors’ portfolio.Pension risk transfer business poised for growth: Prudential’s Retirement segment is set to benefit from the company’s penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Appetite for risk of pension plan sponsors have off late increased, given a low interest rate, greater accounting and regulatory changes and larger-than-expected funding contributions. There has been a worldwide escalation in pension de-risking demand with the United Kingdom emerging as the leading market.Rising demand for retirement benefits’ products: As baby boomers approach the age of retirement, Prudential should witness huge demand for products that benefit the silver years. About one-fourth of the population will turn 65 or older by 2050. Also, Asian markets including Korea and Taiwan, each of which also has a grey populace is showing keen interest in retirement-oriented products. The company should enjoy a competitive edge on the back of Prudential’s vast distribution network, a superior brand image and time-tested presence.Growing international business: Prudential is expanding its global foothold, mainly in Japan, Korea and China, vital for long-term growth. The company’s Brazilian business has gained a sufficient scale and should become an important contributor to its earnings growth in the overseas division over the next few years. Further, business growth in Malaysia, an attractive market with low life insurance penetration, a well-developed regulatory environment and a long-term growth potential, must boost the company’s foreign operational activities.Effective Capital Deployment: Banking on robust, sustainable cash generation, Prudential envisions a free cash flow ratio of about 65% of adjusted operating income on average over time. The insurer’s annualized dividend has nearly doubled over the last five years and currently yields 3.65%, better than the industry average of 2.49%. It also has $1.5 billion under share buyback authorization for 2018. All these collectively make Prudential a lucrative pick for yield-seeking investors.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $12.15, representing a year-over-year increase of 14.8% while for 2019, the consensus mark stands at $12.82, translating into a 5.6% year-over-year rise.Prudential has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 8.5%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company shows a decent earnings surprise history, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last three quarters with an average beat of 5.85%.Attractive Valuation: Shares are trading at a price to book multiple of 0.8, lower than the industry average of 1.31.  Price to book is the best multiple to value insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps finding stocks that are undervalued. This deviation from their fair value is what creates an exceptional upside opportunity. Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable Value Score Score of A or B coupled with a bullish Zacks Rank offer the best investment bets.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the insurance industry may also consider other top-ranked stocks like Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report), Assurant, Inc.

84,AIZ,"Moody’s Investors Service, a subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation, recently gave ratings to Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) and its property and casualty (P&C) as well as life insurance operating subsidiaries. This rating action followed the closure of Assurant’s buyout of The Warranty Group from TPG Capital for about $2.5 billion. The credit rating giant downgraded Assurant's senior debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2 while for its P&C operating subsidiaries, the rating agency downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings to A3 from A2 and from A3 to Baa1 for its life insurance subsidiaries. The outlook for these ratings remained stable.Ratings Representation of Assurant and its UnitsAssurant’s substantial increase in financial leverage together with higher levels of goodwill and intangibles are reflected by the ratings downgrade. Moody’s projects consolidated financial leverage (on a pro forma basis) to increase approximately 28%, up from 22.6% from year-end 2017. However, the rating giant mentioned that the company’s financial leverage on the basis of tangible equity is likely to be much higher.The buyout of The Warranty Group is likely to widen Assurant’s market presence in vehicle service contracts, apart from boosting its geographic diversification and achieving substantial savings through expense synergies. But the company’s exposure to catastrophe loss will render volatility to both earnings and capital.The downgrade of insurance financial ratings for Assurant’s life insurance units, American Bankers Life Assurance Co of Florida and Union Security Insurance Company, is in line with the rating actions on Assurant. With the stable outlook, the rating agency anticipates that Assurant will continue to deliver better-than-expected results, especially on the back of a lower tax incidence, which is likely to boost the company's bottom line, considerably in the near future.  Solid market position amongst a number of niche, specialty P&C insurance markets forms the basis of the Multi line insurer’s ratings.However, considerable cat loss exposure plus a modest scale and susceptibility to adverse changes with respect to legal and regulatory environment are likely to offset the aforementioned strengths.Factors Leading to an Upgrade or DowngradeThe factors that could lead to a ratings upgrade include a noticeable reduction in gross and net catastrophe exposures, consolidated financial leverage meaningfully lying below 25% on a sustained basis, better capitalization and solid profitability on a continued basis as well as parent company liquid resources around $500 million.On the flip side, the factors that might lead to a downgrade are a considerable rise in catastrophe exposure (on gross or net basis) as a percentage of shareholder equity or a 10% or more decline in shareholder equity, consolidated financial leverage above 35% on a sustainable basis, earnings coverage of interest lower than 4x for an extended period and parent company liquid resources much below $250 million.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence as well as in maintaining credit worthiness of a stock. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, Assurant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Assurant have lost 6.7%, narrower than the industry’s decrease of 8.8%. We expect the company’s concerted efforts to diversify its product and service portfolio as well as its segmental performance and a robust capital position to turn the stock around in the near term. Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), Federated National Holding Company (FNHC  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp.

85,AIZ,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AIZ due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Assurant Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Up Y/YAssurant reported first-quarter 2018 net operating income of $2 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. Also, the bottom line improved 6.9% from the year-ago period. Lower effective tax rate owing to the tax cut and decent underlying profitable growth in key businesses like mobile business and multi-family housing, drove this improvement. However, higher level of net operating loss at the Corporate segment and a substantial catastrophe loss in Global Housing, partially offset this upside.Total revenues improved 7.2% year over year to $1.6 billion, mainly attributable to higher premiums earned, fees and other income as well as net investment income. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.2%.Net investment income improved nearly 8% year over year to $130.2 million.Total benefits, loss and expenses increased 12.4% to $1.5 billion, mainly due to a substantial increase in policyholder benefits, selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums, fees and others at Global Housing slid about 1.6% year over year to $523.1 million, primarily due to lower placement rates as well as real-estate owned volume in lender placed insurance plus reduction in client demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions. However, sustained growth in multi-family housing and higher contributions from international housing products partially offset this downside.The company reported net operating income of $71.2 million, which increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. This improvement was mainly attributable to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.  Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Lifestyle improved 14.1% year over year to $918.5 million. This benefit was primarily driven by growth in new and existing mobile protection programs as well as vehicle protection. However, a decline in mobile trade-in volumes partially offset the upside.Net operating income of $55.8 million rose 6.5% year over year. The upside was driven by the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.Net earned premiums, fees and others at Global Preneed grew 4.5% year over year to $46.2 million, primarily owing to growth in the United States including prior period sales of the Final Need product.Net operating income slipped 1% year over year to $9.8 million, mainly due to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate.Net operating loss at Corporate & Other was $20 million, substantially wider than the year-ago quarter’s net operating loss of $10.1 million. Increases in employee-related costs from the year-earlier quarter along with the adverse impact of the reduced effective tax rate were responsible for this downside.Financial PositionAssurant’s financial position remains strong with around $575 million in corporate capital as of Mar 31, 2018. Total assets rose 1.8% to $32.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018 from $31.8 billion at year-end 2017.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company did not buy back any shares in the quarter under review.The company’s total dividends amounted to $30 million in the first quarter.2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income (excluding reportable catastrophe loss) to grow between 10% and 14% from the reported results of $413 million in 2017. The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and a considerable rise in underlying segment earnings (while adjusting for $12.5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items). Declines in lender-placed insurance and credit insurance are likely to be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi-family housing as well as vehicle protection.Notably, with the sanction of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), Assurant’s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22-23% from 33% with nearly one-third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth.Assurant projects operating earnings per share (excluding catastrophe loss) to grow in excess of net operating income, representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate, moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management.The company expects Global Housing to witness a year-over-year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Further, the company expects to witness a decline in the ongoing lender-placed insurance normalization and mortgage solutions. However, continued growth in multi-family housing is likely to partially offset this downside. Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019. Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20-21% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth. Revenues are projected to be close to 2017-levels as decrease in lender-placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.Global Lifestyle’s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as vehicle protection expansion and expense efficiencies. The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside. Lower effective tax rate of 22-24% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is anticipated to boost results. Moreover, the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection, globally.Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings, mainly on the back of the company’s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform. Lower effective tax rate of about 22% with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth, is estimated to enhance results.Assurant expects full-year net operating loss to be close to 2017’s loss of $63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate & Other. The loss will likely increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20%.Dividends from the units, namely Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to be higher than the net operating income (including catastrophe loss) owing to the implementation of TCJA.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.
