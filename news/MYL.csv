Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies rose 0.1%.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler upgraded Valeant to a buy rating from neutral and raised her price target to 27 from 15. She noted, ""we acknowledge the turnaround.""""After a drug-by-drug review, we conclude that Valeant is growing its key brands and has stabilized losses from older products,"" she said in a report to clients. ""There is even potential pipeline upside.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseToday, Valeant's profile looks more Mylan's (MYL), Koffler said. About 70% of its sales consist of stable products that are either consumer-focused or are older drugs that have already gone generic.Further, ""there is actual growth potential from its pipeline, which contains multiple catalysts in 2018-20,"" she said. ""For this stock to work in the next year, we think Valeant simply needs to execute on its quarters and push through new product launches.""So far that's happening. In the first-quarter, Valeant stock jumped after the pharmaceutical company topped sales views and raised 2018 guidance. The firm will soon change its name to Bausch Health Companies, after its Bausch and Lomb segment.Valeant pledged to double its dermatology revenue over the next five years. Koffler doubts that promise will come to fruition. But she does see $1 billion in sales from Valeant's ""significant seven"" drugs as possible.Among the ""significant seven,"" Valeant lists psoriasis treatments called Siliq, Jemdel and Duobrii. It also has treatments for glaucoma, eye redness and opioid-related constipation.The firm expects sales to grow at a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate from 2018 to 2021, and for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to grow 5% to 8%. Koffler sees the guidance as challenging.But other pharmaceutical companies have set similarly high, ""seemingly unattainable,"" growth targets, she said. Plus, there's minimal clinical downside for Valeant as ""there are minimal pipeline expectations, so if anything works, it is upside to the stock.""Upcoming, the Food and Drug Administration will consider approvals of three drugs — two psoriasis treatments and a drug to treat acne. It's also possible Valeant could unveil data from studies of medicines to treat acne.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses Short

4,MYL,"Investors didn't cut Mylan (MYL) any slack Thursday after the company announced that U.S. regulators will likely delay its generic version of blockbuster asthma inhaler Advair.On the stock market today, Mylan tumbled 5.2% to close at 39.51. Meanwhile, shares of generic pharmaceutical companies dipped 0.8%. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which developed asthma inhaler Advair, advanced 1.9% to 41.94.The Food and Drug Administration found ""minor deficiencies"" in Mylan's application for its generic Advair. It will likely issue a complete response letter, rejecting the application. The news isn't entirely surprising, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said.Koffler argued that the announcement is a ""cosmetic setback"" after Mylan gained approval for a biosimilar of Amgen's (AMGN) Neulasta.

""We say cut them some slack.""Koffler kept her buy rating and 51 price target on Mylan, and still models $71.5 million in 2018 sales of generic Advair. In 2020, she sees generic Advair sales hitting a peak at $365.3 million. Mylan kept its outlook for 2018 total sales of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion.Mylan's application for generic Advair received a priority designation from the FDA. That means it could grab approval prior to the standard 90-day time period after Mylan responds to the minor deficiencies.""Though we don't currently know how long it will take the company to gather the information to compile the response, and what it will entail, we believe that risk associated with a lengthy delay is modest at this point,"" Koffler said.Glaxo's full-year guidance assumes that a competitor will bring generic Advair to market in mid-2018. In that scenario, it models about $998 million in U.S. sales of Advair for the year. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be flat to down 3% on a constant-currency basis.Advair brought in about $4.17 billion in global sales in 2017.

7,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) surged to a nearly eight-week high Tuesday after the Food and Drug Administration approved its knockoff of Amgen's (AMGN) bone marrow stimulant Neulasta.On the stock market today, Mylan popped 3.8% to close at 39.98. Earlier, the stock rocketed as much as 8.1% to touch a high last seen in mid-April. Meanwhile, shares of Amgen dipped 2 to 181.73. Shares are forming a buy point at 192.72 out of a cup base.This is the first Neulasta biosimilar approved, but it likely won't be the last, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report to clients. Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) and Novartis (NVS) are also working on biologic copies of Neulasta. Coherus shares jumped 5.6% to 16.05. Novartis was off 1.1% to 74.90.He expects the approval to challenge near 20% of Amgen's top line. After the first U.S. approval in 2017 of a biosimilar of Neupogen — the short-acting version of Neulasta — Amgen's product revenue fell by 30% annually due to volume and price erosion, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""A similar erosion pattern for such an important product would unlikely be offset by the company's growth product portfolio and the new launch of (migraine drug) Aimovig, and Amgen's top-line revenue would be at risk for a potential decline,"" he said.For Amgen, U.S. Neulasta sales were $3.93 billion in 2017, representing 17% of its total revenue. Porges says Mylan's Neulasta biosimilar, a drug called Fulphila that was codeveloped with privately held Biocon, shouldn't hurt Amgen's 2018 revenue outlook for $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion.Further, Amgen could work to push its Neulasta Onpro medical device, which automatically injects the drug into a patient's body, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a report. In the first quarter, about 62% of Neulasta's $1 billion in U.S. sales came from Onpro.But MacKay cut his price target on Amgen by 1 to 183, and kept his sector perform rating. He called for weakness in shares and trimmed his U.S. 2018 sales expectations for Neulasta to $3.56 billion from $3.61 billion. The Street expects $3.81 billion.Next up, Coherus' Neulasta biosimilar will go before the FDA in November. Later, Novartis and its partner Apotex will have updates. A second U.S.-approved biosimilar of Neulasta would create increased competition and potential price headwinds, MacKay said.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler sees Mylan generating $100 million in 2018 revenue from its Neulasta biosimilar. That will climb to $554 million in 2022, its peak year, she estimated in her report to clients.""Realistically, sales may outperform our expectations as Neulasta's profiled syringe currently generates sales of about $1.4 billion per year, and Mylan is thus far the only approved biosimilar, and may therefore fill the channel ahead of competition,"" she said.Leerink's Porges noted Amgen and Mylan are fighting a patent battle. Amgen claims Mylan's Neulasta biosimilar infringes of two of its patents for methods of purifying proteins used in biological products. A trial will likely begin in mid-2019.""We view these manufacturing patents as weak protection for Amgen, and we are not surprised to see Mylan launch at risk against them,"" he said. Mylan expects to launch Fulphila within a few weeks.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

8,MYL,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues. Patients must be monitored after their first dose.""The attribute neurologists care most about in a next-generation S1P therapy is the absence of first-dose monitoring,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said. ""They also rank an advantage on liver enzyme impact pretty far down the list of comparative advantages they're looking for in an S1P vs. Gilenya.""It's not clear whether ozanimod will have a similar requirement. But Celgene management indicates ""the going assumption is that ozanimod won't avoid it,"" Raymond said in his note to clients.""As we see it, unless ozanimod can avoid first-dose monitoring, Celgene faces an uphill battle in its efforts to differentiate the molecule,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

A European Medicines Agency committee has recommended approving the Amgen/Allergan biosimilars and Pfizer's Herceptin biosimilars.

Rest-of-the-world sales were in line, growing 8% to $626.7 million.The decline in North America was ""primarily due to the combined impact of the loss of exclusivity in olmesartan (blood pressure) products, lower sales of branded products, including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, the divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets and the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards,"" Mylan said in a news release.Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share climbed 3% year over year and beat consensus by a penny. That metric came in line with Mylan's own expectations.Despite the shortfall in the first quarter, Mylan reiterated its guidance for 2018 sales of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion, beating consensus for $12.43 billion at the midpoint.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Friday, Perrigo said the FDA will likely delay its generic ProAir, though the firm didn't say why. Previously, Perrigo had expected to launch its copycat in the fourth quarter of 2018. It had expected generic ProAir to be worth 9 cents in full-year earnings per share and had guided to $5.05-$5.45 a share in overall profits on its May 8 quarterly earnings conference call.Steadman noted the difficulties with developing an asthma product. GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Advair also faces mounting competition. Teva launched a generic in 2017 and Mylan (MYL) is expected to launch one this year. But he sees the delay for generic ProAir as ""relatively minor.""""As evidenced with generic Advair development and now ProAir, it's been extremely difficult to develop generics for inhaled products and we're not certain of the timeline for a potential ProAir launch,"" he said.For Teva, Perrigo's delay means there are no other potential makers of generic ProAir in 2018, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note. ProAir generated $350 million in U.S. sales in 2017.Still, Teva is facing a number of other issues as it attempts to restructure under new Chief Executive Kare Schultz. Its plan, unveiled in February, cuts the workforce by 14,000, closes several plants and terminates a slew of specialty programs in an effort to save $3 billion.""While a delay in generic competition would be a benefit to Teva's top line, this is obviously a rather minor positive relative to the other challenges the company is currently facing,"" Divan said. He sees ProAir adding $20 million to $40 million quarterly through mid-2019.Divan has an outperform rating and 23 price target on Teva.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

27,MYL,"Amgen's (AMGN) future among biotech companies could be in trouble, an analyst said Tuesday.The No. 1 company in its sector trades at a premium to biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), but its pipeline contains fewer blockbuster opportunities. Meanwhile, generic and biosimilar competition is hacking away at a $15 billion chunk of its revenue, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Investors have been rewarding Amgen for its share repurchase programs and steady cash flows. But it lacks long-term stability. Generally, investors look for biotech companies with unpriced optionality in their pipelines. Amgen doesn't have that.""In Amgen's case, the inability to identify which programs might offer that upside, particularly for a company of this size, reinforces our belief that Amgen must commit to significant business development activity to expand its portfolio or its pipeline,"" Porges said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePorges estimates 65% of Amgen's portfolio is likely to steadily decline. Some of its biggest moneymakers — Epogen, Aranesp, Neupogen, Neulasta and Enbrel — are facing rivalries. The growth potential of new and acquired products isn't enough to offset declines in these franchises.Epogen and Aranesp treat anemia. Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) just gained approval to make a copy of Epogen/Procrit. Novartis (NVS) also has a copycat of Neupogen, a bone marrow stimulant.Blockbusters Neulasta and Enbrel are also at risk. Neulasta also stimulates bone marrow. Enbrel treats some chronic diseases, including forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Novartis already has a copycat of Enbrel. Novartis, Mylan (MYL) and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) are working to copy Neulasta.In response, Amgen has restructured its expense base, initiated a dividend and levered up the company's balance sheet, Porges said.But, ""compared to peers, we regard Amgen as a more defensive stock, but also one lacking the explosive upside potentially typically associated with breakthrough or rapidly growing bio-therapeutic stocks,"" he said.Porges sees Amgen as worth about $130 billion or 194 per share, which is about 10% above the most recent closing price. He has a market perform rating and 210 price target on Amgen stock. On the stock market today, shares rose 1.1% to close at 178.36. Shares of biotech companies lifted a fraction.""The most concerning conclusion of this analysis is the lack of opportunity in Amgen's pipeline outside the elements in our (sum-of-the-parts),"" he said. Celgene and Biogen, on the other hand, have ""greater pipeline optionality and growth prospects.""Eventually, the firm will have to engage in smart mergers and acquisitions, Porges said. The best mergers and acquisitions will pivot away from Amgen's challenged legacy products to mid- to late-stage pipeline opportunities to build on its revenue projections for 2020-30.It's possible the biotech could be interested in a ""merger of equals.""As it stands, ""the company's current pipeline is either very early or has shared economics, and thus is unlikely to meaningfully alter the outlook for an about $120 billion company with current revenue of $23 billion per year,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

28,MYL,"Amgen (AMGN) stock took double hits Tuesday as Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) grabbed approval for a knockoff of Amgen's anemia treatment and Eli Lilly (LLY) reported strong results for a competing headache drug.On the stock market today, Amgen stock toppled 2.1% to close at 172.34. Pfizer dipped 0.5% to finish at 35.69. Lilly slipped 1% to 82.21.Shares of all three stocks are consolidating with respective buy points at 192.72, 39.53 and 89.19. And shares of biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies each fell a fraction.The Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer's drug called Retacrit midday Tuesday. Retacrit is a biosimilar — and almost identical biologic copy — of Amgen's drug Epogen/Procrit. Epogen/Procrit is an anemia treatment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePfizer's approval isn't a major hit for Amgen's revenue, which saw just $244 million in first-quarter sales of Epogen. Epogen was Amgen's seventh biggest drug in the first quarter, but sales declined 10% vs. the year-earlier period.But others are attempting to copy Amgen's biggest drugs, Neulasta and Enbrel. Neulasta increases bone marrow stimulation. Enbrel treats five chronic diseases including some forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Both are blockbusters.Novartis (NVS) has an Enbrel biosimilar called Erelzi. The drug is approved, but Novartis' unit Sandoz can't launch Erelzi until its patent dispute with Amgen is complete. Novartis' Sandoz, Mylan (MYL) and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) also are working on biosimilars of Neulasta.Amgen is also rivaling Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) with a migraine drug in a class called anti-CGRPs, short for calcitonin gene-related peptide. All four firms are working on treatments that would prevent chronic migraines.On Tuesday, Lilly said its medicine, called galcanezumab, met its key goal in a late-stage study of patients with episodic cluster headaches. It reduced weekly cluster headaches compared with a placebo across weeks one to three of a two-month treatment period.A statistically significantly greater percentage of patients treated with Lilly's medicine also saw at least a 50% reduction in weekly attacks compared to placebo at week three. The drug proved safe and tolerable. Lilly's drug is also being studied in migraines.Amgen and Novartis partnered to develop Aimovig. It's likely to be the first in its class to get approval to prevent chronic migraines. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision about Aimovig later this week.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

The stock ended the regular trading session down 4.4% to 17.78. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 22.74.

Adjusted profit of 94 cents a share fell 11.3% but crushed views for 68 cents. Sales came in at $5.07 billion, dipping 10.4%, but that still beat the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $4.8 billion.Generic drugs, Teva's biggest unit, declined 23% in North America to $1.09 billion. Teva cited price erosion in the U.S. for the slide. But in Europe, Teva's generic drugs climbed 17% to $997 million. Growth in over-the-counter volume was partially offset by price reductions.Sales of multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone tumbled by a third globally to $645 million, but that still beat Koffler's view for $594.5 million. In the U.S., revenue declined by 40% as Copaxone now faces generic copycats from Mylan (MYL) and Novartis (NVS) and its partner Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA).Austedo brought in $30 million, crushing Koffler's estimate for $18 million. The drug was first approved in April 2017 to treat cholera associated with Huntington's disease. In August 2017, it got approval to treat involuntary body movements tied to long-term use of some drugs.Teva also boosted its 2018 guidance and now sees adjusted profit of $2.40-$2.65 per share, up from $2.25-$2.50.

By year's end, Teva expects to achieve at least half the $3 billion spending cut it has planned.""Now that we have more details on the plan, including a 2018 outlook that we believe is achievable and we are seeing signs of early execution toward that plan, we are taking the additional step and upgrading Teva shares,"" Divan said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva popped 3.6% to finish at 19.27.Guidance for $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales for the year includes the potential impact of a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone 40-milligram. Teva said on its earnings conference call that the first quarter should be the strongest.IBD'S TAKE: Teva is trading in line with its 50-day moving average. But what does that line mean and is it at risk? Head to the Investor's Corner for a closer look at using the 50-day moving average to pinpoint opportunity or risk.Mylan (MYL) already has approval of a Copaxone copycat. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed on its generic, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit should have a generic on the market this year, analysts say.Copaxone was ""the one bright spot"" in the fourth quarter, Divan said. Revenue of $821 million declined 19% but held up better than expected. He assumes a second generic will enter the market in the first half of 2018 and sees rapid sales erosion through 2019.A delay to Teva's migraine drug is a new negative, but was expected, Divan said. In that class of drugs, called CGRP inhibitors, Teva is rivaling Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR).""We believe the migraine market is large enough for multiple blockbusters, even if Teva is third or fourth to the market,"" he said.U.S. generics are likely to continue facing challenges in 2018 amid pricing pressure, an acceleration in Food and Drug Administration approvals of competing generics and difficulty in acquiring share from drug originators, he said.Divan expects U.S. generic sales of $4 billion in 2018 declining to $3.8 billion in 2019 and then facing single-digit declines beyond that.""However, here as well we believe expectations entering 2018 are more reasonable than what they have been in the past, providing an opportunity for the company to meet or beat expectations as we move forward,"" he said.RELATED:Regeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These RivalsCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 DiseasesThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

40,MYL,"Plunging shares of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) weighed on generic drug stocks Thursday after sales and profits continued to drop and it offered weak 2018 guidance, all on top of word of a potential delay for its key migraine drug.X For the fourth quarter, Teva brought in adjusted profit of 93 cents per share on $5.46 billion in sales, declining 32.6% and 15.9%, respectively. Sales of multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone declined 19% to $821 million amid growing generic competition.For the year, Teva sees adjusted profit of $2.25-$2.50 per share on $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales, lagging the consensus for $2.93 and $19.17 billion, respectively. Teva's outlook reflects the likelihood of increasing challenges.""Management noted that roughly half that decline reflects the impact of the loss of exclusivity on Copaxone 40 milligrams,"" Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note to clients. ""A significant chunk of the decline also, and not surprisingly, reflects continued pressure in the U.S. generics business.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva plunged 10.6% to close at 18.64 though earlier it fell as much as 12.6%. Generic drug stocks collectively dipped 3%.Analysts say rival Mylan's (MYL) new Copaxone generic is priced at a 30% discount to Teva's branded drug. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis (NVS) unit Sandoz should have a 40-milligram generic on the market this year after a Pfizer (PFE) manufacturing facility passed its re-inspection.Generic drug sales fell 16% year over year to $3.11 billion. In 2017, Teva recorded $17.1 billion in goodwill impairments related to its U.S. generics business. Pricing pressure, government regulation, accelerated generic approvals in the U.S. and delays in launches continue to be challenges.While sales were down, Teva profits and revenue both topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of 81 cents a share on $5.3 billion in sales. Copaxone sales also beat the consensus view for $611 million, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Still, she expects another generic entrant in mid-2018.IBD'S TAKE: Teva's Relative Strength Rating has been on the rise this month. It now has an RS Rating of 86 out of a best-possible 99. See what goes into that rating by visiting IBD Data Stories.Further, Teva said the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in its migraine drug, fremanezumab, received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding the fill/finish part of its facility. This means fremanezumab could be delayed.Fremanezumab is currently set to go before the FDA in June. The drug belongs to a class known as anti-CGRPs, which aim to prevent migraines. Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are all working on drugs in this class.""This is another source of anxiety surrounding a business that simply cannot afford to have additional missteps, particularly in the context of a highly competitive anti-CGRP/migraine space,"" Amsellem said.RELATED:Sanofi, Regeneron Dip As Eczema Drug Dupixent Lags In EuropeCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

Both metrics missed analyst views for adjusted profit of $1.20 a share on $3.1 billion in sales.Mylan also raised the lower end of its 2017 sales and earnings guidance. For the year it now sees $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion in sales, the midpoint of which was just ahead of analyst views for $12.07 billion. On a year-over-year basis, sales would rise 9% at the midpoint.Adjusted income is expected to come in at $4.45-$4.70 per share.

50,MYL,"A British billionaire reportedly is considering buying a stake in Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), prodding shares of the Israeli drugmaker to pop Monday despite a price-target cut following a lackluster quarter.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva jumped 8.9% to close at 12.41. Allergan (AGN) also sustained a price-target cut following its mixed report last week, and shares dipped 0.3% to close at 174.34.Len Blavatnik is looking to acquire up to a $3 billion stake in Teva, according to Reuters, which cited reports from Israeli outlets over the weekend. Teva has a $12.4 billion market cap. Shares hit a 17-year low last week after third-quarter earnings missed and Teva cut its 2017 guidance.Blavatnik could either acquire a stake in Teva through a private stock listing or by scooping up some of Allergan's 10% stake. Allergan received 10% of Teva as part of a deal last year in which it sold its generics business to Teva. Last week, Allergan said it was looking to sell that stake.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan trimmed his price target on Teva to 8 from 14, and kept his underperform rating. He expects the stock to continue to ""languish"" as investors await an updated strategic plan from new Chief Executive Kare Schultz.""Teva left a lot of questions unanswered on their conference call,"" Divan said in a note to clients. ""This is understandable since the new CEO just joined the company the day before, but the lack of insight is still frustrating.""IBD'S TAKE: At least one biotech had ""alarming"" results, though earnings were mixed for most. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the industry group thus far in the third-quarter earnings season.Teva, the No. 2 maker of generic drugs, now finds itself on the flip side of the coin. Mylan (MYL) just launched a generic version of Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug from Teva. Now, Divan sees Teva pulling in $1.01 billion in U.S. Copaxone sales next year, down 71% year over year.""Mylan came to market immediately and at a price that was lower than Teva expected,"" he said.Questions also remain for Allergan, Divan said in a separate report. He cut his price target on Allergan to 224 from 243, though he kept his outperform rating. Like Teva, Allergan is soon to face generic competition for Restasis, an eye drug. It sees competition in either January or July 2018.""Our base case now assumes Restasis generic entry in the U.S. at the start of 2018, instead of mid-2018,"" he said. ""Our base 2018 EPS of $15.25 is down from our previous $16.55 in large part because of this change and what we assume would be a relatively rapid erosion in sales.""Generics could also pressure Namenda EX (extended release), Estrace, Delzicol and Aczone, drugs to treat dementia, a menopausal side effect, ulcerative colitis and a type of acne, respectively.Divan also lowered his estimate for Kybella, a drug to reduce fat under the chin, ""given the limited commercial progress that product has made.""

51,MYL,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

52,MYL,"In the wake of a weak earnings report, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) has a ""long road ahead"" as rival Mylan (MYL) prepares to launch a copycat of Teva's Copaxone drug and the U.S. generics environment worsens, an analyst said Thursday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva dove to a 17-year low with shares collapsing 19.9% to finish at 11.23, though earlier they crashed as much as 22.6%. The stock hit its lowest point this decade, touching a low it last saw in May 2000.For the quarter, Teva reported $5.61 billion in sales, up 1%, in line with the consensus. But adjusted earnings of $1 per share lagged the average view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.03 and toppled 20% year over year.The biggest source of pain came from Teva's generics unit which plunged 8% to $3 billion. In the U.S., generic drug sales fell 9%. European sales increased 6% to $985 million. Sales for the remainder of the world declined 18%, while over-the-counter sales decreased 22%.President Donald Trump has said he'd like to install a competitive system to bring down drug prices. To that end, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has pledged to speed generic approvals and lower drug costs.IBD'S TAKE: Teva isn't the only drugmaker that struggled in the third quarter. Dow's Pfizer fell to a seven-week low as several drugs in its legacy medicines unit lost market exclusivity. Head to The Income Investor for more on what befell Pfizer in the quarter.Teva acknowledged the decline in the U.S. was ""mainly due to challenging market dynamics including pricing declines resulting from customer consolidation into larger buying groups and accelerated FDA approvals for generic versions of competing off-patent medicines.""Specialty medicines also declined 1% to $2 billion. In the U.S., sales fell 4% to $1.5 billion, partially offset by increases of 10% and 12% in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. The unit brought in 36% of total sales for the quarter, Teva said in a news release.The biggest declines for Teva were from its Azilect, a Parkinson's disease drug, and Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis medication. Azilect toppled 64% to $36 million and Copaxone, Teva's largest moneymaker, plunged 7% to $987 million after the FDA approved generic versions of the drug.Respiratory drugs climbed a collective 30% to $351 million as sales of oncology drugs inched up 12% to $302 million.Teva cut forecasts, citing earlier generic competition for multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. Teva now sees 2017 adjusted profit of $3.77-$3.87 per share vs. prior guidance of $4.30-4.50. Full-year revenue will be $22.2 billion-$22.3 billion, compared with previous guidance of $22.8 billion-$23.2 billion.Analysts had previously called for adjusted income of $4.11 on $22.69 billion in sales.For the fourth quarter, the new 2017 guidance implies sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion and 70-80 cents adjusted earnings per share. Both metrics lagged consensus expectations for $5.82 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $1.07 per share.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat summed up Teva's quarterly report and guidance cut in one sentence: ""This will be a long road ahead for Teva.""Animal health specialist Zoetis climbed 4.3% to close at 67.31 after topping analysts' views for sales and adjusted income in the third quarter.Zoetis wrapped the period with adjusted profit of 65 cents a share and revenue of $1.35 billion, above expectations for 63 cents on $1.325 billion, respectively. Sales grew 9% and adjusted profit rose 25% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The firm also raised full-year targets. For 2017, it sees adjusted earnings of $2.34-$2.39 per share on $5.23 billion to $5.28 billion in sales. Analysts had modeled adjusted profit of $2.34 a share on $5.21 billion in revenue.RELATED:How Blood-Disease Data Sent These 2 Biotech Stocks FlyingNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing ViewsMylan Topples As President Named In 'Mind-Blowing' Antitrust Scheme

53,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) and company President Rajiv Malik were among those named in a sweeping lawsuit Tuesday, in which 46 state attorneys general expanded a complaint charging 18 drugmakers with what prosecutors called a ""mind-blowing"" scheme to fix generic drug prices.XThe newly expanded complaint alleges that the drugmakers colluded to fix the prices of pharmaceuticals by communicating at trade shows, conferences and other events, as well as through email, phone and text messages.All together, the 18 companies worked together to falsely inflate the prices of 15 drugs to treat glaucoma, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, anxiety and asthma as well as several other conditions, the attorneys general allege.""We allege in this complaint that the defendant companies' collusion was so pervasive that it essentially eliminated competition from the market for these 15 drugs in its entirety,"" Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in a prepared statement.Jepsen, who is leading the charge, described the conspiracies alleged as ""mind-blowing.""Mylan says it stands by Malik and has ""found no evidence of price fixing on the part of Mylan or its employees."" Mylan said it's still waiting for the attorneys general to share the information intended to substantiate the new allegations.""Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its president, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully,"" the firm said in a prepared statement. ""Mylan and Rajiv Malik both intend to defend this case vigorously, and we look forward to the opportunity to present a full defense.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have largely had mixed reports this quarter, though Celgene's sales miss on lower-than-expected sales of Otezla caused the stock to slide hard. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at earnings season thus far.In 2015, generic drug sales in the U.S. were estimated at $74.5 billion and, today, the generic drug industry accounts for about 88% of all prescriptions written in the U.S.Along with Mylan, the lawsuit also includes generic giant Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA). The new complaint added Actavis Pharma — acquired by Teva from Allergan (AGN) — Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) and Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Mylan toppled 6.6%, near 35.10, as the broad generic drugs group plunged a collective 1.7%. Another generic firm named in the complaint, Lannett (LCI), led the downward slide, falling 13.7% to close at 19.90.Along with Mylan's Malik, Satish Mehta, chief executive and managing director of privately held Emcure Pharmaceuticals, the parent company of Heritage Pharmaceuticals, was the other individual named in the complaint.Earlier this year, two former Heritage executives admitted to a price-fixing scheme between April 2013 and December 2015 involving a generic antibiotic and a diabetes drug. Heritage was among six drugmakers named in the initial lawsuit in late 2016.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat expects a series of settlements. He had originally expected Teva to pay $300 million to $700 million in damages if it ultimately settles and Mylan to pay $380 million to $770 million.RELATED:Generic Drugmakers Crash After Perrigo Searched In Antitrust ProbeCelgene CEO: Drug-Pricing Debate Hinges On Incentives For InnovationDOJ Charges Pharma Execs With Price-Fixing; Teva, Mylan Stocks Fall

54,MYL,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) received two price-target hikes Friday, following a five-day conference on cloud computing that demonstrated its growing strength in artificial intelligence.X Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ken Sena raised his price target on Amazon to 1,525 from 1,430, a 30% premium from where the stock currently trades. Sena raised estimates on Amazon Web Services, the company's fast-growing cloud computing unit. He expects AWS revenue to reach $60 billion in the fourth quarter, up 39% from the year-ago period.Amazon announced a slew of new products and services at its annual cloud computing conference in Las Vegas this week, called re:Invent, with about 43,000 attendees.

56,MYL,"Allergan (AGN) stock tanked Monday after a federal judge invalidated patents covering eye-drug Restasis, in a dispute pitting Allergan against a group of generic drugmakers led by Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan toppled 3.5% to finish at 198.41. Teva fell 1.8% to close at 14.71, as Mylan lifted a fraction to end the regular trading session at 38.18.Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the Restasis patents were too obvious to protect, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. Bryson tended to agree with Allergan that there would be a case for infringement if the patents were held to be valid.Allergan pledged in a news release to appeal the decision. The ruling invalidates four patents on Restasis. To date, none of the proposed generic versions of Restasis have received approval and none are able to launch in the market, the firm noted.""Allergan remains committed to vigorously defending the intellectual property of our products, which allows us to continue to invest in developing and bringing forward new medicines for millions of patients,"" Chief Legal Officer Robert Bailey said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks tracked in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of better-performing drugmakers.This followed Allergan's move last month to transfer the rights to these patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe — a legal play that's been called creative and controversial as it takes advantage of the Native American tribe's sovereign status.Bryson had ""serious concerns about the legitimacy of the tactic,"" Raffat said.""Allergan purports to have sold the patents to the tribe, but in reality it has paid the tribe to allow Allergan to purchase — or perhaps more precisely, to rent — the tribe's sovereign immunity,"" he said. If successful, this method could give patent defendants a new method of defeating challenges.Raffat expects a final decision based on Allergan's appeal late into 2018.

58,MYL,"Allergan (AGN) was already facing a ""public relations backlash"" after transferring patent rights for its Restasis eye medication to a Native American tribe, when a judge on Monday then invalidated four of those patents.XNow, Allergan faces an uphill battle in regaining credibility on Wall Street, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients. He cut his price target on Allergan to 243 from 266, but kept his outperform rating.""We generally have been fans of the Allergan management team, but find it challenging to defend the steps that were taken with the patent agreement,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""We believe it will take some time for the management team to regain the credibility it has lost through this process.""The process involved transferring the rights to its Restasis patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in September to avoid a patent challenge. As a Native American tribe, St. Regis Mohawk has sovereign immunity. But the play has been called both creative as well as controversial.On Monday, a judge invalidated four patents covering Restasis. Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the patents were too obvious to protect. He also expressed serious concerns regarding the legitimacy of the transfer to St. Regis Mohawk.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a best-possible 99. It lags top players like AbbVie with a CR of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other high-ranking drug stocks.Even before Monday, Allergan stock had lost 12% of its value following the agreement, Divan wrote. The loss in district court also does nothing to ""erase the public-relations backlash the company has suffered from going through with the agreement in the first place.""Combined with a push by the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic drugs at a faster clip, Divan assumes a generic launch of a Restasis drug by mid-2018, up from his earlier view for 2022. Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are among those working on generic versions of the drug.For longer-term investors, Divan sees 198 as an attractive entry point to the stock. In the short term, catalysts include third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 and the potential for a guidance update with and without generic Restasis competition.""If guidance is not provided on the Nov. 1 call (at least at a high level), investors will likely have to wait until the January time frame for the company's 2018 guidance,"" Divan said.Data readouts include a late-stage trial in treating acute migraines and a midstage trial of a drug to prevent migraines in the first half of 2018. Both belong to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs. Teva, Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working in this arena.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan slipped 0.3% to close at 197.78, after ending Monday trades down 3.5%.RELATED:Allergan Tanks After Judge Invalidates Restasis PatentsWhy Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

60,MYL,"Never count out Mylan (MYL), an analyst said Wednesday, after the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic versions of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug — setting shares of the two companies on vastly divergent paths.XBy the close of trading on the stock market today, Mylan had spiked 16.2% to 37.80. Teva, meanwhile, plunged 14.6% to 16.08. Analysts largely hadn't expected the FDA to approve generic Copaxone until 2018.The approvals were for a 20-milligram daily dose and for 40-milligram shots three times per week. The 40-milligram approval is the first generic at that dose. Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) got approval for a 20-milligram daily Copaxone generic, Glatopa, in 2015.Mylan also announced a patient support service dubbed Mylan MS Advocate to help ease patients off branded Copaxone and to its generics with an interactive mobile app, in-home injection training, a 24/7 call center, copay assistance for eligible patients and support from a nurse experienced at treating MS.Analysts were widely surprised at the approvals, which came on the heels of fresh comments from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Bloomberg regarding the need to speed generic drug approvals to spur competition and reduce drug prices.""Bottom line, this is incrementally positive for Mylan while for Teva both a negative surprise and a cash flow hit to 2018,"" RBC analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his underperform rating on Teva stock.Teva called the impending launch by Mylan ""at-risk,"" meaning the rival generic drugmaker could be subject to damages and other remedies pending the outcomes of appeals decisions and other patent litigation.In one case, Teva is arguing against a December 2016 decision by the Patent Trial Appeal Board that found all claims from three Copaxone patents were invalid. Teva also is arguing against a January decision in district court that invalidated the claims of four patents covering Copaxone.The firm also is suing five companies, including Mylan, claiming they infringed on a patent covering the manufacturing process for Copaxone. All five companies are working to bring generic copies of the MS drug to the market.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 7 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 7% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. See better-rated drug stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Teva expects Mylan's generic launch to eat 25 cents earnings per share in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. RBC's Stanicky noted Teva had previously predicted one or two generics could lead to $1 billion to $1.3 billion in annual revenue downside and a $1 hit to per-share earnings.""Teva previously guided to slow Copaxone deterioration due to the stickiness of its patient support program which could play out initially,"" he wrote. However, Mylan's patient support program ""should drive more switching over time.""Consensus numbers project 9% erosion to Teva's Copaxone in the fourth quarter and a decline of 39% in 2018, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. He expects Teva to ""have to dig deeper for additional cost cuts to offset some of this.""BTIG analyst Timothy Chiang models Mylan bringing in $425 million to $450 million in generic Copaxone sales in the first 12 months following its launch, assuming generic pricing is a 35%-40% discount to the branded drug and Mylan can grab 25%-30% of market share.""We believe the company gaining approval on both strengths of Copaxone not only validates Mylan's core competency as a premier generics company, it also provides an important signal to investors that one can simply never count out Mylan — especially in the area of complex generic products,"" he said.Chiang kept his buy rating on Mylan stock and boosted his price target to 45 from 42.Mylan, in a news release, said it and other first filers could be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity, but noted that the FDA hadn't yet made a formal determination on that. In the 12 months ended July 31, both strengths of Copaxone brought in $4.34 billion in sales, the firm said.The approvals could be a negative for other entrants, like Momenta and Novartis' Sandoz which are working on getting approval for a 40-milligram version of Copaxone. In February, the duo got a warning letter from the FDA which detailed issues at manufacturer Pfizer's (PFE) fill-finish plant.Momenta stock plunged 13.7% to 15.10 in response to Mylan's approvals.Payers are likely to also put pressure on Biogen (BIIB) to lower the prices of its MS drugs, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research report. In 2016, the six-drug suite brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales.""We believe this highlights the need for Biogen to concede price or share as multiple new generics and branded therapies enter the market in the coming years (especially in a space that does not have high intrinsic growth),"" he wrote.Abrahams estimates Biogen reporting $9 billion in MS drug sales in 2017, but declining 17% by 2025 to $7.6 billion. He noted ""these declines could be higher if payers get more aggressive."" Biogen stock dipped 0.8% to 314.92 in response.RELATED:Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tBiotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisHow Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

62,MYL,"Everyone knows high prescription drug prices are a problem, but except for pharma stockholders, few people may realize that price cuts are rippling through the generic side of the industry.Take a look at recent events: Tumbling U.S. generic drug prices wiped out billions of dollars in market value in August for the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY). That compounded the industry's woes after a brutal second-quarter earnings season.The relatively small contingent of pharma companies that produce cheaper versions of brand-name drugs is getting broadsided by players in the distribution chain. For one, leading wholesalers are squeezing drugmakers for lower prices to undercut one another in the battle for pharmacy contracts. Meanwhile, group-purchasing organizations are consolidating and grabbing onto more negotiating power, representing a hurdle for generics which comprise a large chunk of those purchases.Analysts say it could be six to nine months before prices stabilize — if they ever recover at all. While that means lower prices for patients, drugmakers are taking the brunt of the battle. Prices have clearly deteriorated in the aftermath of contract negotiations, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an Aug. 12 audio report.""And the question really is: What does that mean going forward?,"" he said. ""Because if you look at the way Mylan and Teva stocks have behaved and you look at the way their estimates have been revised, it clearly suggests a material worsening in business.""Teva stock lost 50.7% in August, though it has recovered 7.9% this month, and the No. 1 drugmaker by market cap is close to losing that status. Since July 31, Teva's market value has fallen by nearly half to $17.56 billion. Comparatively, Mylan trails at a $16.85 billion cap.Teva isn't the only one feeling the pain. Selling pressures shaved $4 billion off Mylan's market capitalization in August, and its shares have toppled 19% since the beginning of August after particularly disheartening quarterly reports. As a whole, Investor's Business Daily's Generic Drugs industry group is down 6.6% year to date after nearing a four-year low in August. It's ranked No. 160 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.The underlying cause of the price erosion stems back to 2013-14, when drugmakers spiked prices based on shortages, monopolies and other opportunities, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan told IBD.""If something was $10 per day, you would see it up to $15 per day because you're the only one making it and there was no competition,"" he said. ""If there's no one else producing it, you have more flexibility (in how you price a drug).""""Now that card is gone,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The top-ranked generic drugmaker is Ani Pharmaceuticals, which has a middling CR of 61. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the stocks.That's not only because competition is more fierce, it's also that generics face another adversary: heavy scrutiny from the media and in Washington. In January, then President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" in their pricing. Now, he's aiming to use competition to undercut prices.Complicating matters, some drugmakers — Teva, Mylan and Perrigo (PRGO) included — are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged generic drug price fixing. Last month, two members of Congress sent letters to makers of multiple sclerosis drugs to probe rising drug prices.That's yet another wrench in the generic story, Divan says.""Investors are looking for cleaner stories,"" he said. ""And there's too much unknown here.""Teva and Mylan, on their second-quarter earnings calls, projected price erosion in the high-single digits for the rest of 2017. Mylan specified that erosion would take place in its North American generics unit. That followed lackluster quarterly reports from both. Mylan's North American sales declined 9%, while Teva's numbers were helped by the acquisition of Actavis Generics.Both Teva and Mylan cut their 2017 forecasts. On their calls, executives from the two companies acknowledged an increase in generic approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was champing at sales. New FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is looking to speed up generic approvals even more to help ease drug prices, which is in line with Trump's vision.""During the quarter we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics,"" Mylan President Rajiv Malik said. ""Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products.""As a result, Mylan said it would delay launching generic versions of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) asthma drug Advair and Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone amid the ""uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.""Teva's former interim chief executive, Yitzhak Peterburg, cited customer consolidation, an increase in FDA generic-drug approvals and products that were either delayed or subject to more competition for ""accelerated price erosion and decreased volume"" in the second quarter.FDA approval complications were cited across second-quarter reports, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in an Aug. 17 report to clients. Though generic approvals are catching some wind under the FDA's new goal, complex generics — a molecular copy that also has a complex active ingredient, formulation, route or device combination — have been subject to administrative delays.Koffler sees Mylan as best-positioned to rebound despite its tie to the challenged generics sector. The firm has a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars, guidance is now more realistic and it's less levered than its peers, meaning it could pursue acquisitions of companies whose stocks have dropped.""The risks are that pricing pressure in the U.S. may not abate, and the overall profitability of the company is declining as it expands into lower-margin international markets that now comprise a greater percentage of its revenue,"" she said.A few drugmakers seemingly escaped the second-quarter malaise. But those reports were somewhat misleading, CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo told IBD.Perrigo issued a beat-and-raise that helped its stock fly 16% in a day. Though Perrigo's generic drug sales toppled 13% year over year, its separate consumer health segments had smaller 4% and 9% declines in the U.S. and internationally, respectively.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) crushed second-quarter profit views, though sales came in a hair light. The firm also cut its 2017 revenue target, but kept its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization forecast.""A lot of people consider Valeant as a generic play, but the bulk of the business is now Bausch & Lomb"" eye-care products, Loo said. In the quarter, revenue from Bausch & Lomb as well as Salix, its gastrointestinal-drugs division, represented 73% of total sales. Its smaller generics unit, on the other hand, fell by 33%.""If you exclude Valeant from the generic space and Perrigo, none of these generic drugmakers really bucked the trend in the second quarter,"" Loo said. ""I think that it (pressure on the group) will likely continue going forward for the next two quarters.""Teva leads the U.S. generic drugs sector, but it's also under the most pressure, Steven Schoenfeld, chief information officer of BlueStar Indexes, told IBD. BlueStar Indexes tracks Israeli equities. Cybersecurity play Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is now bigger than Teva in terms of market cap, at $18.18 billion.Former Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman stepped down in February amid a bribery investigation. Since then, management has been shaky and the firm's strategy has been out of kilter, Schoenfeld says. This followed its loss of several key patents protecting MS drug Copaxone in January. In September, Teva named former Lundbeck and Novo Nordisk (NVO) veteran Kare Schultz as its new chief executive officer.Still, Teva is splitting its focus between generic and branded drugs, Schoenfeld says.""They need a strategy,"" he said. ""They need to see if they want to expand or continue to invest in blockbuster drugs. They've now got some early-stage Alzheimer's assets and other drugs. They have to decide if they're going to be X percentage generic and, if so, do the profits go into innovation?""Meanwhile, debt has rocketed and investors are no longer sure the $40.5 billion Teva paid to acquire Actavis Generics from Allergan (AGN) was a good price, he says. As of June 30, Teva had $35.1 billion in debt, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of March.Under Schultz, Teva recently avoided a covenant violation on its debt. On Sept. 19, Teva said it amended several term loans and revolving credit facilities, ""providing Teva greater flexibility in its financial leverage ratio covenants.""The question at the forefront now is whether the U.S. generic drugs sector has hit a bottom.In recent history, Mylan has come under scrutiny for the pricing of its emergency allergy injection, EpiPen. Turing Pharmaceuticals' former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, drew criticism for spiking the price of a decades-old HIV drug. Teva is among those being looked at for MS drug prices.""Popular culture has turned against it,"" BlueStar's Schoenfeld said. ""Secular trends aren't going to go away. The market sees pricing pressure. Have these stocks priced in the worst? Teva is trading where it had major support in the 2001-03 time frame. But I wouldn't recommend anyone plunge into Teva.""Most firms are now trading at four to five times their earnings, CFRA's Loo says. Amid continuing price erosion, he sees the stocks trading sideways for the next six months. He notes there aren't many drugs going off patent in the near future, causing somewhat of a roadblock for new generics.""I would like to hope they've hit a bottom,"" he said. ""There are not that many catalysts for them going forward. You might see some buyers step in and buy shares of these companies. Four to five times earnings is an awfully attractive valuation.""RELATED:Biogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: AnalystHow A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebound Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

64,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) rocketed Monday after announcing a former Novo Nordisk (NVO) executive will take the helm at Teva, just seven months after its last full-time chief executive resigned amid a bribery scandal.Hours later, Teva said it's selling its Paragard implantable contraceptive to CooperSurgical for $1.1 billion in cash. Paragard brought in $168 million in the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, Teva said in a news release. The deal includes Teva's manufacturing site in Buffalo, N.Y.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva catapulted 19.4% to 18.50 to touch a high last seen in early August. Teva led IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group, which rose 1.3% to its highest point since July 26.Kare Schultz will become Teva's president and CEO, Teva said in a press release. Schultz will take over for interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg. Peterburg assumed control in February after former head Erez Vigodman resigned amid two bribery probes by U.S. regulators.Schultz comes from Danish drugmaker Lundbeck where he worked president and chief executive for two years. Before that, he spent nearly three decades at Novo Nordisk in a slew of roles, including chief operating officer.At Lundbeck, Schultz is credited with leading a restructuring effort and turnaround that put the firm on track of achieving record sales and profit, Teva said. He also previously worked at McKinsey and Anderson Consulting.In addition to the sale of Paragard, Teva said it's actively working to sell its the remaining pieces of its women's health business as well as oncology and pain businesses in Europe. Teva expects to generate at least $2 billion in total proceeds from the sale of these businesses as well as other asset sales to be wrapped by year's end.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a low IBD Composite Rating of 4 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it lags most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at drugmakers with better ratings.Teva shares have been in a slump over the past two years.Teva is the No. 1 generic drugmaker by market cap, but one of its biggest concerns is a branded drug named Copaxone to treat multiple sclerosis. A judge tossed out four key patents on Copaxone earlier this year, meaning generic competition is likely in 2018.In February, Vigodman left Teva in a wake of controversy and, since then, analysts said Teva has lacked direction. In July, it looked possible AstraZeneca (AZN) Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship to take the top job at Teva, but those rumors quickly died down.Last month, Teva crashed 40% over three days after delivering consensus-lagging sales and profit for the second quarter.

AbbVie will grant patent licenses to Amgen on a country-by-country basis.Humira is AbbVie's most important drug, bringing in 69% of total sales in the second quarter ended June 30. Ten other drug firms are working on Humira biosimilars, including Biogen (BIIB), Novartis (NVS), Dow's Pfizer (PFE) and Mylan (MYL), Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie and Galapagos are also working together on cystic fibrosis drugs. But Vertex Pharmaceuticals says it has a strong lead and analysts don't disagree. Head to The New America for a breakdown on the market and why Vertex is leading the pack.The consensus is calling for Amgen's Humira biosimilar, the first approved, to bring in $748 million in worldwide sales in 2025, up from just $50 million in 2018 when it's set to launch in Europe. Still, there are patents remaining that AbbVie could use to extend litigation, Raffat said.But RBC analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his views for success for Amgevita/Amjevita to 95% from 65%. He expects Amgen's drug to penetrate at its peak 30% and 50% of the Humira biosimilar markets in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.MacKay models peak global sales of Amgevita/Amjevita hitting $928 million in 2032. On a sales share basis, he expects Amgen to have 20% of the Humira biosimilar market, depending on royalty rates. He kept a sector perform rating and 192 price target on Amgen.RELATED:Biotechs Beating The Market, But Are They In Buy Range?These Companies Gain If Trump's Foreign Profit Relief Plan PassesWhy Amgen, Lilly, J&J Are Interested In These Small BiotechsAbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's Share

66,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) stocks rose Tuesday despite sustaining a price-target cut and a downgrade, respectively, following their lackluster second-quarter reports and resulting haircuts to 2017 guidance.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva inched down 0.2% to 17.01. Mylan gained 1% 30.73. Still, both stocks have traded well below their 50-day moving average this month as U.S. generic-drug makers face pressure.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler slashed her price target on Teva nearly in half to 16 from 30, though she kept a neutral rating. She sees Teva struggling to bring gross debt below $30 billion by year's end and facing upcoming competition for multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.Teva ended its second quarter with $35.1 billion in debt. It's likely struggling to ""patch together a combination of asset sales,"" operating cash flow, an Allergan (AGN) working capital settlement and a full dividend cut to bring gross debt below $30 billion this year.If that initial $5 billion debt hurdle is cleared, Teva indicated it should be able to push out the maturities on $6 billion in bank debt by refinancing, Koffler wrote in a note to clients. This may help shares, though it wouldn't solve all of Teva's problems.Generic versions of Copaxone are likely to come to the market in 2018, eroding already weak earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation, she wrote.""Longer term, we expect a decline in the remaining business and don't see anything in the branded pipeline to change this trajectory,"" she wrote. ""Teva may eventually lose its investment-grade rating as a result and further share deterioration is a possibility longer-term.""Argus analyst Jasper Hellweg downgraded Mylan to a hold rating from buy, citing its weak outlook. Mylan's guidance for adjusted income of $4.30-$4.70 per share implies a decline of 8% at the midpoint in 2017. The firm also lowered its sales view to $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.IBD'S TAKE: One of these two top U.S. generic-drug makers could be poised for a rebound, one analyst said last week. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deep dive on which drugmaker looks stronger and why.Still, Mylan stock has been under pressure for over a year ""due to the controversy surrounding EpiPen pricing,"" Hellweg wrote in a note to clients. Earlier this month, Mylan finalized a $465 million settlement with the Justice Department over EpiPen pricing under Medicaid.The Justice Department alleged ""the company had overcharged Medicaid by classifying the EpiPen as a generic rather than a branded product,"" he wrote. ""Drugmakers are able to pay lower rebates to the government for generic drugs than for branded drugs.""Recently, the Justice Department revealed the source of its information was Sanofi (SNY). In a separate antitrust suit, Sanofi alleges that Mylan offered discounts to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers that made it more difficult for Sanofi's rival drug to get Medicaid reimbursement.The New York attorney general also is investigating Mylan's practice of selling EpiPens to schools at discounted prices in exchange for exclusive contracts, Hellweg said. Mylan has since eliminated the exclusivity provisions from these deals.Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP) also is likely to take some share from Mylan's EpiPen after gaining approval for its drug Symjepi, ""which will be marketed as a low-cost alternative to the EpiPen,"" Hellweg wrote. It's also preparing a ""junior"" dose of Symjepi to compete with low-dose EpiPen.""Symjepi is smaller than the EpiPen, a potential advantage for a product that is often carried at all times by people with life-threatening allergies,"" he wrote. ""We look for the EpiPen to benefit from its established reputation.""Many consumers are likely to prefer EpiPen as an auto-injector vs. Symjepi, which is a self-administered injection, Hellweg wrote.RELATED:How A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

67,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) shares rose Thursday after it announced a $465 million settlement with the Justice Department over its EpiPen classification under Medicaid, and on an analyst's suggestion it could rebound from a generics downtrend.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Mylan lifted 0.6%, near 30.70, for its third consecutive day in the black. Earlier in the month, Mylan followed in the footsteps of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) with disappointing quarterly results and a guidance cut.Over 12 days in July and August, IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group lost 17% of its value amid a number of lackluster second-quarter sales and earnings reports. Since then, it's risen by almost 9%, though earlier hit its lowest point in nearly four years.But Thursday, Mylan popped after announcing the Justice Department settlement. The underlying question in the case was whether EpiPen products were properly classified with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.""The settlement allocates money to Medicaid programs of all 50 states and establishes a framework for resolving all potential state Medicaid rebate liability claims within 60 days,"" Mylan said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: The generic drugs group has struggled amid disappointing reports from Teva and Mylan. Can they break that trend? Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at what's impacting those stocks.Per the settlement, Mylan will reclassify its EpiPen epinephrine auto-injector under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and pay the rebate applicable to innovator products effective as of April 1, 2017. Previously, the drug was classified as a non-innovator product.Generic drugmakers in the U.S. struggled in the second quarter amid pricing erosion and administrative delays at the Food and Drug Administration for approvals of complex generic drugs, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients.But Mylan ""remains the most attractive pick of the group,"" she said. The drugmaker is best poised for a rebound based on its pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars, though those pieces are less certain and are ""taking longer than expected to play out.""""The risks are that pricing pressure in the U.S. may not abate, and the overall profitability of the company is declining as it expands into lower-margin international markets that now comprise a greater percentage of its revenue,"" she wrote.During its second-quarter earnings conference call, Mylan said it would defer all major U.S. launches from its 2017 guidance to 2018, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone. Advair is an asthma drug from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Copaxone is Teva's multiple sclerosis treatment.On top of that, ""EpiPen no longer presents a source of potential upside, in our view, and next quarter may have difficult (comparisons) vs. last year's back to school season,"" Koffler wrote. Still, she kept her buy rating, though cut her price target to 37 from 53.The stock is trading 20% below that target, so there could still be some upside. Approval of generic Advair could lead to a pop, Koffler said. She updated her model to Mylan's 2017 outlook for $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion in sales and adjusted income of $4.30-$4.70 per share.RELATED:How a Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Rise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

68,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) stocks diverged Wednesday after an analyst reportedly upgraded Mylan on its ""differentiated and durable"" generic drugs portfolio, but issued Teva a downgrade.In morning trades on the stock market today, Mylan popped as much as 4% and but settled back to a gain of 1.1% to close at 30.47. Teva toppled 2.7%, to finish at 17.49.According to various news accounts, Citigroup analyst Liav Abraham sees Mylan as having a more favorable balance sheet relative to peers like Teva and Endo International (ENDP). She upgraded Mylan to a buy rating from neutral and boosted her price target to 42 from 36, according to The Fly.The company is in the best position to outperform in the challenging market for U.S. generic drugmakers, Abraham reportedly said in a note to clients. Citigroup didn't immediately return a request for copies of the report from Investor's Business Daily.Abraham also downgraded Teva to a neutral rating from buy, and cut her price target to 19 from 32. She has a neutral rating on Endo.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 36, meaning it outperforms about a third of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But that's out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated drug stocks.For Teva, one of the biggest obstacles is its debt which, as of June 30, was $35.1 billion after it needed to finance the acquisition of Actavis Generics. Teva's debt is nearly double its $17.96 billion market cap.Mylan and Teva both cut guidance in the second half of 2017 after issuing quarterly results that lagged the consensus. Perrigo (PRGO) beat the trend, though, soon after reporting Wall Street-topping metrics and boosting its guidance.RELATED:Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCan Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?

70,MYL,"Perrigo (PRGO) shot to a six-month high Thursday after bucking weakness in its generic drug business and the industry overall by topping second-quarter expectations and raising its 2017 guidance.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Perrigo popped 18%, near 78.30, after earlier spiking as much as 20.4% to touch a high last seen in late February. Meanwhile, generic drug stocks collectively rebounded 3.5%.Generic drug stocks have been under pressure this month. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL), which lead the group, reported lackluster quarterly results and cut guidance. The entire group traded down for 12 straight days, but began recovering Wednesday.Early Thursday, Perrigo reported $1.24 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, topping the consensus for $1.18 billion and 92 cents, respectively, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman wrote in a note to clients.But its generics unit is becoming less important, Steadman said. Perrigo's beat arrived on the back of its consumer business while generics declined 13% year over year in part on lower sales of Crohn's disease drug Entocort.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are better-rated than generic drug stocks. Perrigo has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Celgene (CELG) leads the biotech group with a CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at top-rated stocks.On a year-over-year basis, consumer sales in the Americas and internationally declined a respective 4% and 9% after Perrigo sold off unprofitable businesses last year.

He expects Perrigo to shift further toward a consumer-driven business over time and, on that ""significant opportunity,"" he kept a buy rating and 80 price target on Perrigo.Perrigo also raised its 2017 guidance to adjusted income of $4.45-$4.70 per share vs. earlier views for $4.15-$4.50, and topping consensus views for $4.28, Steadman said.RELATED:Can Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?How Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersTeva Crashes To 13-Year Low On 'Very Tough Quarter'

71,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) crashed for the third straight day Monday after last week reporting Wall Street-lagging second-quarter metrics, leading to a 2017 guidance and dividend cut.XShares toppled 9.9%, to 18.59, on the stock market today, after closing down 13.3% on Friday and down 24% on Thursday — the day of its earnings report. Cumulatively, Teva has lost 40.5% of its value since Aug. 2. Teva has traded down since July 27.At least five analysts have downgraded Teva over the last week including Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan who wrote a note to clients titled ""Three Strikes and We're Out"" on Thursday. He downgraded Teva to a neutral rating and cut his price target to 25 from 39.""We had taken a more constructive view on Teva shares in late 2016 and we felt, while there remained some challenges still ahead for the company, the valuation of the stock appeared compelling,"" he wrote. ""Clearly, we misjudged the scope of these challenges.""Alongside Teva's topple, IBD's 17-company Generics Drugs industry group has tanked 4.8% since Aug. 2. The group has traded in the red since July 24. On Monday, Impax Laboratories (IPXL) and Mylan (MYL) plunged 5% and 2.8%, respectively.Impax's topple was likely related to a settlement with Endo (ENDP) over an opioid. Impax will be required to pay Endo higher-than-expected royalties off of that drug, a generic of Endo's Opana extended release formula.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 8 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of better-rated generic drug stocks.There are very few signs of stabilization for Teva. Without a full-time chief executive or chief financial officer, it's difficult to see any mid- to long-term upside for the company, he argued. Future pricing or volume deterioration in U.S. generics could further hurt Teva.It's also possible that Teva could see generic competitors to multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, which lost several key patents protecting it earlier this year. Delays in its migraine drug known as fremanezumab could also provide challenges, he said.UBS analyst Marc Goodman called the report ""another bad day for Teva"" in a note on Thursday following Teva's announcement. He referenced a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge that Teva paid, related to its U.S. generics reporting unit in the second quarter.""Given the significant 2017 guidance cut, the dividend cut, the impairment charge of $6.1 billion along with the second-quarter miss, it's understandable that the stock would trade down this significantly,"" he said in a note.RELATED:Teva Crashes To 13-Year Low On 'Very Tough Quarter'Why This Biotech Is jumping Today On Its Rival's Cannabis-Tied DrugAstraZeneca Pops On Report CEO Won't Jump Ship For Teva Pharma

72,MYL,"Generic drug maker Mylan (MYL) continued its free-fall Friday while rival Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) managed to briefly arrest its slide, but broader generics led by Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) defied the trend and spiked higher for the third straight day.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group popped 3.3% to its highest point since Aug. 3, the day Teva reported second-quarter earnings and sales that missed, and cut guidance.Generic drug stocks broadly traded down for 12 consecutive days, but began to recover earlier this week. Eagle and Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS) led the group midday Friday, rising a respective 11.1% and9%. Perrigo (PRGO), which offered a quarterly beat-and-raise this week, popped 2.2%, near 78.90.Analysts expected Perrigo's generic drugs business to topple in the quarter following disappointments from Teva and Mylan. Its generics business did decline 13%, but strength in its consumer-driven business was enough to help Perrigo top expectations.Perrigo shot up 15.8% Thursday on its second-quarter report. It's ""amazing what one good quarter can do,"" UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote in a research report. He has a buy rating and an 84 price target on Perrigo.Goodman noted Perrigo did the unexpected — it increased its net sales guidance for 2017 in its generic drugs unit. Perrigo bumped its expected generics sales to $950 million, from earlier views for $925 million, due to earlier-than-expected launches of new products.""But the significant move in the stock was also due to solid upside from both consumer businesses in combination with cost-cutting execution, which is driving margin improvement, which appears to be sustainable,"" Goodman said.IBD'S TAKE: Inflation could have had a part to play in some earnings misses. Head to IBD's Economy page to see how Teva and others could have been impacted.Perrigo boosted its generics guide despite calling for 9%-11% year-over-year erosion in generic drug prices for the second half of the year.In a separate report, Goodman nearly halved his price target on Teva to 19 from 34, though he kept a neutral rating. He expects Teva to see generic competition to its multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone in the first quarter of 2018 after losing several key patents earlier this year.""More importantly, we have significantly lowered the U.S. generics numbers, both topline and margins, based on how management sees the new generics landscape,"" he wrote. ""Our analysis suggest this is not a buying opportunity; hence, we remain neutral on the stock.""Goodman assumes Teva's U.S. generics business will likely decline 3%-4% on average from 2017-21, decreasing from $5.4 billion to $4.7 billion. This will be ""driven by a base erosion of about 11% that would be partially offset by new product launches,"" he said.Teva expects U.S. generics revenue will decline in 2018-19. It's looking to save money by closing down manufacturing facilities, as well as synergies through the Allergan (AGN) generics deal. Teva acquired Allergan's generics business last August.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersAstraZeneca Pops On Report Its CEO Won't Jump Ship For Teva Pharma

74,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) hit a four-year low, taking generic drug stocks with it after reporting second-quarter metrics that lagged Wall Street and cutting guidance for the next two years, but then recovered to post a slight gain Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Mylan ended the trading day up 0.9% to 32.08 after earlier falling as much as 7%, hitting a low last seen in June 2013. This is the sixth consecutive day Mylan has spent in the red following a disappointing report from fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).The crash initially sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down as much as 2.4%, but the sector recovered in recent trades, rising nearly 1% at the close. Still, Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO), Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) and Perrigo (PRGO) remained down 7.3%, 5.4% and 0.3%, respectively.For its second quarter ended June 30, Mylan reported $2.96 billion in sales, up 16% year over year, but that missed the consensus for $3 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share lagged by 9 cents and fell 5%.Revenue in North America was hit hardest, down 9%, as sales in Europe and the rest of the world grew 59% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period. Sales of its EpiPen injection for allergic reactions declined due to increased competition.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get a look at better-rated stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Mylan also cut its guidance for 2017 to $11.5 billion-$12.5 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $4.30-$4.70 a share. For 2018, it now sees adjusted earnings of ""at least $5.40,"" down from earlier views for $6. The new target would be 20% above 2017 expectations, at the midpoint.""Given the region's ongoing challenges and uncertain U.S. regulatory environment, we have elected to defer all major U.S. launches from our full-year 2017 financial guidance to 2018, including generic Advair and Copaxone,"" Mylan said in a news release.Advair is used to prevent asthma attacks and flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It's branded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), but Mylan and others are working on generic versions of it. In May, the Food and Drug Administration delayed Mylan's application for the drug.Mylan and others are also working on a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, which lost four key patents earlier in the year.The Medicines Company (MDCO) popped despite lagging second-quarter revenue, on losses that beat expectations and promising clinical updates, including an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug that could rival Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Medicines Co. noted during the second quarter that it came to agreements with regulators in the U.S. and Europe over its drug, inclisiran, as a cholesterol-buster. In total, it expects to enroll 3,400 patients in a Phase 3 trial designed to support the submission of applications for its approval.Inclisiran is what's known as a PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor, which has a slightly different mechanism than PSCK9 inhibitors from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi. Medicines Co. is also working on a study of 14,000 patients to determine whether there's a cardiovascular benefit from inclisiran.For its second quarter ended June 30, Medicines Co. reported $18.7 million in sales, down 66%. That missed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $31 million in revenue.Adjusted losses of $1.02 per share widened from a 69-cent loss in the year-earlier period. But that topped the consensus' view for an adjusted loss of $1.29 per share.Medicines Co. lifted 3.9%, to close at 37.71.RELATED:Tesaro Beats Sales Views But Losses Up; Nektar Misses On EarnsHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersMylan In FDA Limbo On Generic Multiple Sclerosis Drug

Trump's threat to wreck ""fire and fury"" on North Korea, which continues to make nuclear and missile advances, unnerved investors, but earnings and corporate news may have had a bigger effect.RELATED:S&P 500, Nasdaq Break Support: 4 Steps You Should Take NowBig Picture: Market Uptrend Is Under PressureWalt Disney (DIS) will end its movie distribution deal with Netflix (NFLX) in 2019, saying it'll create its own video-on-demand subscription service in the U.S. Disney won't pull TV shows from Netflix, and an ongoing Marvel-Netflix collaboration will continue. Still, the move could force Netflix to spend more on its own content, notably big-ticket films. Netflix fell 4.9%, nearly returning to its July breakout buy point before a Friday bounce. Meanwhile, Disney, which reported mixed Q2 results, said its planned ESPN streaming service will start in early 2018, not by the end of 2017. Disney sank 5.3%, hitting an eight-month low.RELATED:Netflix Fall Continues Over End Of Disney Movie Deal Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix SubscribersNvidia (NVDA) earned 92 cents a share, up 124% year over year, on sales of $2.23 billion, up 56%, in the quarter ended July 30. Analysts expected 70 cents and $1.96 billion. For the current quarter, the graphics-chip maker expects sales to rise 18% to $2.35 billion, vs. the consensus of $2.13 billion. Nvidia cited strong chip sales for video game devices, data centers and artificial intelligence applications, though some analysts said data center revenue was a little light.

The optical device maker reported in-line Q2 profit but revenue was light amid weakness in the company's North America business as well as China. Lumentum management said it has $200 million in orders for 3D devices in calendar 2017 and manufacturing yields have been solid. One question, though is how much Apple business Lumentum will potentially share with Germany's AMS, Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI). Lumentum said China's inventory correction could last until the December quarter.Drug and biotech earnings were a mixed bag with Perrigo (PRGO), Horizon Pharma (HZNP), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) topping views while Mylan (MYL), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) lagged second-quarter expectations. Valeant and Mylan cut their guidance, while Perrigo, Horizon and Ionis (IONS) boosted pieces of their full-year outlook.

In other news, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) hit a two-year high after bumping up its timeline to file applications for two cholesterol-lowering treatments.Wendy's (WEN) second-quarter results topped Street estimates, with Stephens analysts attributing the strong showing to its value 4 for $4 meals and marketing of fresh, never-frozen beef in its hamburgers. Jack in the Box (JACK) same-store sales came in better than expected, but some analysts hope the chain can reclaim customers with a bigger push on cheap combo offerings and other deals. The company also continued to weigh whether to sell, or do something else with, Qdoba, its Mexican chain. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) beat on the top and bottom line. McDonald's (MCD) set its sights on China, forming a partnership that will aim to expand the number of locations there to 4,500 from 2,500.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported second-quarter EPS growth of 20% with revenue up 13% to $13.441 billion, both better than expected.

77,MYL,"Life was simple for Rachel Martin in 1991. By day, she worked at an accounting firm on her way to becoming a CPA, and by night she ran -- until she started to notice her feet felt strangely stiff.XThat led to three bits of news one day soon after. Two were good, yet the odds still stacked up against her. ""That day I got notice of the multiple sclerosis, I got notice we sold our condo and I got notice of receiving my CPA license,"" she told Investor's Business Daily.The numbers haven't gone Martin's way ever since. She was 27 when diagnosed, half a lifetime ago. She hasn't worked for 23 years and has spent zero hours of her life working as a CPA. She's taken at least four medications to treat her MS, and exactly none have fully contained the ailment.A barrage of new drugs are taking aim at MS, however, offering hope for Martin and others with the debilitating illness. The medications are offering the lower costs you might expect when a market heats up, but they offer prospects for fewer side effects and, most critically, greater effectiveness.Several heavy hitters in the industry are getting involved in this biopharma battle. Roche (RHHBY) has a new drug that could swipe share from market leader Biogen (BIIB). Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG) and a number of generic-drug manufacturers are expected to pile the pressure on another mainstay in the field, Novartis (NVS).Roche shares were down fractionally Monday to close at 32.15 while Biogen ticked up 0.6% to finish at 234.70. Celgene was up marginally to 137.84 while Novartis was down slightly to 84.29.The MS sector has been dominated by Biogen, which brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales during 2016 with six medications in its arsenal. Included in its inventory is one MS drug that Martin recently stopped using, Avonex, as well as two other top sellers, Tysabri and Tecfidera.Now there's ""a paradigm shift,"" especially where Roche's MS drug, Ocrevus, is concerned, according to Michael DiFiore, analyst for Evercore. Ocrevus was approved earlier this year as a treatment for both relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive forms of MS. Offering medication for primary progressive is a breakthrough, since that form of MS comprises just 10% of the market and has not been targeted by treatments in the past.Ocrevus' twice-a-year infusion looks attractive for patients like Martin, who discontinued using certain drugs due to MS-related tremors. Martin's first medication was an interferon in 1994. She was on the medicine for 22 months until the shaking in her hands became so severe that she couldn't administer the injection.Analysts say Roche's drug puts Biogen's Tysabri and Tecfidera at the greatest risk of market share loss. Some Wall Street estimates see Ocrevus taking away 40%-50% of Tysabri sales and 30%-40% of Tecfidera revenue over three to four years.""With Ocrevus on the market, you have the threat of share being stolen,"" DiFiore told IBD. ""You also have the possibility of looking at generic versions of (Novartis') Gilenya and (Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA)) Copaxone. So there's a lot of moving parts.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 438-company Biotech industry group is now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked as shares have risen 23% for the year, riding high on a June rally that could still see another 15% upside, according to some estimates. Who could benefit in that spike? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In Novartis' case, Celgene is heaping pressure on the company with a potential blockbuster MS drug that now has the test-phase name of ozanimod. Celgene, the No. 2 biotech in market cap is billing ozanimod as a safer version of Gilenya and is targeting the latter half of 2017 to file an application for approval with the Food and Drug Administration.Both ozanimod and Gilenya belong to the class of drugs called S1P receptor modulators. They work by preventing specific white blood cells from moving into the central nervous system. Doing so has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce MS relapses.MS is a disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. Patients fatigue easily and have difficulty walking.""I went from running to walking, to the walker, and then to a wheelchair,"" said Martin. It wasn't muscular ability, she adds, it was balance.""I was able to exercise if I held on to something,"" she said.Medications have brought Martin moderate success to the point where she can generally walk with a cane. She belongs to an MS group called Let's Play in Los Angeles, and her disease is ""steady,"" says her doctor. But it took time in physical therapy and experimentation with four medicines.One medicine caused debilitating headaches. Another was a chemotherapy that, today, doctors know can cause heart damage. Martin managed to avoid that.Martin's current medication is Extavia, made by Bayer (BAYRY) and sold by Novartis. It requires a self-injection every other day. She began using that medicine in April when she quit using Biogen's Avonex after five years, due to headaches.Biogen has the most to lose in this battle with sales of Tysabri, Tecfidera and Avonex on the line. The second quarter is expected to be Biogen's first real test, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. Results are due to be reported Tuesday.Like Biogen's drug Tysabri, Roche's Ocrevus is considered a highly efficient MS treatment. But Tysabri's label contains a black box warning against a deadly virus that attacks the brain. Ocrevus' label doesn't.One case of that virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, also called PML, has been recorded by a single Ocrevus user. But that patient had just come off Tysabri after three years and had only been treated once with Ocrevus. Most analysts don't consider the case to be related to Ocrevus.The risk of PML is likely enough to prod a number of Tysabri patients to switch to Ocrevus, Syed said. Further, Biogen has estimated that a third of patients on Tysabri test positive for an ailment known as the John Cunningham virus. Those patients have weak immune systems and are more susceptible to PML.Analysts say erosion of Tysabri use will be slow. And Biogen isn't particularly worried about its MS franchise. The franchise grew 2.9% in 2016 and expanded to include Zinbryta, launched with partner AbbVie (ABBV). In the first quarter ended March 31, Biogen's MS drug sales grew just 3.1% as all but sales of Tysabri and Zinbryta fell.Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos doesn't see Biogen's MS drugs as a declining franchise, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a June 29 note to clients after a meeting with Vounatsos.""He believes Biogen may lose some market share (to Roche's Ocrevus) but believes there will be 'plenty of opportunities to grow top line,' "" Raffat said. Vounatsos ""does not believe generic Copaxone (Teva's drug) or generic Gilenya (Novartis' drug) will impact Biogen's MS franchise.""Copaxone and Gilenya face their own battles from Celgene and others. Celgene's ozanimod successfully reduced relapse rates vs. traditional interferon treatment in a Phase 3 trial that the company presented in May. Both 0.5-milligram and 1-milligram oral doses were safe and tolerable over a two-year period.Novartis' Gilenya also has its ""own safety issues,"" Mizuho's Syed said. Per the label, patients must undergo monitoring for six hours immediately following their first dose to ensure that their heart rates don't slow to dangerous levels. Gilenya has also been shown to have a toxic effect on liver enzymes.""So Gilenya was not a perfect drug,"" he said. ""(Celgene) said this is a safer Gilenya. We just saw top-line data for ozanimod. That's going to come onto the market, if it gets approved, in 2018.""So ozanimod, if successful, could gouge some of Gilenya's sales, analysts say. In the second quarter, Gilenya sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis to $837 million. That followed major growth in 2016, up 14%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, to $3.1 billion.Celgene is optimistic about its chances in the multiple sclerosis market. In a May 30 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted that management hasn't committed to first-dose monitoring but says a unique dosing schedule could minimize the need for the requirement.""On safety, Celgene management expects to show multiple points of safety differentiation from Gilenya's safety profile and to have a label that will be consistent with its Phase 2 results,"" he said.Then there's the potential generic competition that Novartis faces in 2019. A slew of generics have been approved pending patent litigation from the likes of Teva and Mylan (MYL). Analyst consensus models see $1.92 billion in 2018 Gilenya sales dropping to $447 million in 2020.""If there's nine generics approved tentatively (for Gilenya), that's a price point that's waiting to break,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a May 7 video. But Raffat says it's unlikely Gilenya will go generic in 2019. Patent litigation will likely push generic entry to 2020.And even then, Gilenya has a patent set to expire in 2027 that hasn't really been vetted, he says. The 2027 patent covers the dosing schedule and it only currently faces one challenge. Earlier, it stood up to a challenge from Apotex.Novartis is also studying a low-dose version of Gilenya at 0.25 milligrams. Gilenya is now approved as a 0.5-milligram dose.""If this trial works, it's likely very patentable,"" Raffat said. ""As of 2010 when the FDA reviewed it, the FDA said it's not clear the 0.25-milligram dose will work. That alone is your reason of knowing if the 0.25-milligram (dose) does work (in Novartis' trial), it is patentable because it's not obvious.""A new patent on Gilenya would be another obstacle to generic competition, Evercore's DiFiore said, noting ""that could nullify Gilenya going generic in 2019"" and help the broader MS industry stave off cheaper generics tugging down on drug pricing across the market.Ultimately, the competition could be a godsend for patients like Martin who are hopeful for better MS medicines with fewer side effects.""(Multiple sclerosis is) something that's difficult to describe to people because most of us look like we're doing well,"" Martin said. ""It's like a bubble. I look fine on the outside, but inside I don't feel fine.""RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill Novartis' MS Drug Stomp Celgene's Before It Even Hits The Market?How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

78,MYL,"Stocks stuck very close to home on Thursday as mixed economic data and earnings reports frayed any attempts to build momentum.Better-than-expected weekly jobless claims and June consumer confidence numbers were positive, but a sharp drop in manufacturing growth reported by the Philadelphia Fed before the open helped stoke investor concerns. Investor response to earnings reports cut sharply in both directions, although mostly in soft trade, throughout the session.The result gave the Nasdaq a technical win: another new high and its 10th straight gain. But the increase was less than 0.1%, and in weak trade — no mean feat with Check Point Software (CHKP), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all turning in broad losses, and Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ending with minor losses on the day.Drugmakers Mylan (MYL) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) led the Nasdaq 100. Mylan jumped 3% on positive Phase 3 trial results reported late Wednesday. IBD 50 stock Regeneron also swung up 3% in weak trade as it works through a new consolidation.The S&P 500 slipped a fraction, backing away from a new high notched intraday. Drugmakers were key leaders also, with Perrigo (PRGO) and Mallinckrodt (MNK) each posting 4% gains, although trade was weak.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.1%, despite the valiant efforts of Nike (NKE), which bucked up more than 2% for the day. The stock has fallen below its 59.10 buy point, but the breakout at that entry remains in play.Home Depot (HD) fell 4%, ratcheting up the drag on the Dow. The catalyst appeared to be an agreement by Sears Holdings (SHLD) to sell its respected Kenmore-brand home appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN). The news sent Sears shares to a nearly 11% gain. Amazon sketched out a 0.2% advance.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) led the IBD 50, up more than 3% in above-average trade. That was sufficient to take out a new high, although shares were already extended after an early July rebound from the 10-week moving average. The chipmaker plans to report its fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1.On the down side, Floor & Decor (FND) tumbled 6% in fast trade, falling back below its 10-week moving average. The company priced a 10.7 million-share follow-on offering at 40, just below Wednesday's closing price. The stock remains 83% above its April IPO price.RELATED: These 2 Financials Are In Buy Range With Earnings TonightAmazon Teams Up With Sears, And A New Retail Group TumblesPayPal Stock At Record High On JPMorgan Deal As Online Payment Sizzles

79,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) stock dipped to a six-week low Thursday after indicating late Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration is looking for more information into its generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) Copaxone.In midday trading on the stock market today, Mylan stock was down 1.7%, near 37.23, after earlier falling as much as 3% to touch a low last seen in early May. Teva stock, on the other hand, was up 2.2%, near 31.30.According to Evercore analyst Umer Raffat, Mylan said it received an ""information request"" from the FDA into its 20-milligram version of the multiple sclerosis drug. But Mylan didn't offer an update regarding its 40-milligram version.Wall Street had been expecting an update this week, Raffat said in a note to clients. Mylan had previously guided to a ""target action date"" in June. A target action date is an internal goal at the FDA to take action on an application.""Many investors had debated if that target action date was in the early part of this week,"" Raffat wrote. ""Lack of any update has been a reason for recent Mylan weakness.""The request for more information doesn't necessarily require a meeting with the agency, Mylan said. Raffat doesn't expect a generic version of Copaxone to hit the market in 2017. Novartis (NVS), Sandoz and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) are also working on Copaxone copies.On its first-quarter conference call, Mylan was confident the FDA would take action on its 20-milligram and 40-milligram Copaxone applications in June.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 59, meaning it outperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the best-rated drugmakers.""We see no reason that these dates cannot be met,"" President Rajiv Malik said on the call. ""We believe all the scientific questions have been resolved to FDA satisfaction and we also believe that there are no facility issues that should be a barrier to approval.""Momenta, Sandoz's partner on generic Copaxone, was less bullish on its first-quarter call. Sandoz contracted Pfizer to fill and finish its generic Copaxone, called Glatopa. But Pfizer received a warning letter from the FDA in February over its manufacturing processes.""Based on the work Pfizer has already done to resolve the observations in the warning letter and the effort Sandoz is putting forth to resolve the warning letter, we still believe there is potential for approval and launch of Glatopa 40-milligram in the 2017 time frame,"" Chief Executive Craig Wheeler said on the call.RELATED:How This Small Biotech Could Ruffle The Market In Migraine DrugsTeva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedTeva Pharma, Eagle Pharma, Depomed Among Slew Getting Price Haircuts

80,MYL,"Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) stock plunged to a year low Monday after U.S. regulators asked for a reanalysis of data and more information regarding its copy of Amgen (AMGN) chemotherapy drug Neulasta.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Coherus shares fell 23.9%, to 15.73, as shares of Amgen lifted 0.5%, to 164.88, on the news. Mylan (MYL) stock fell 3% to 38.88. Mylan is also working on a copy of Neulasta.Neulasta is a bone marrow stimulant designed to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Coherus and Mylan are working on copies of the Amgen drug called biosimilars. Biosimilars are biological medical products and are nearly identical copies of the original drugs.But the Food and Drug Administration's request for more data Monday will be a speed bump for Coherus. The FDA is asking Coherus to reanalyze data showing its copycat drug can provoke an immune response, as well as more manufacturing information.Coherus noted in a news release the FDA is not asking for an additional trial in cancer patients for its biosimilar known as CHS-1701. An additional trial would prompt a much bigger delay in the drug's approval.""While we are disappointed in the delay that this additional request has caused, we remain confident in our ability to address the FDA's requests for the purpose of obtaining approval for CHS-1701,"" Chief Executive Denny Lanfear said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen isn't just facing Neulasta competition. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are rivaling the No. 1 biotech with a cholesterol-lowering drug. Head to IBD 50 for a breakdown of the litigation surrounding the three companies.Lanfear expects Coherus to be able to respond to the FDA with a definite path moving forward ""in the coming months."" If approved, he expects CHS-1701 to generate health savings costs in the U.S. Biosimilars are typically less expensive than their counterparts.Next up, Mylan has guided to late 2018 or early 2019 for its copy of Neulasta with its Indian partner Biocon, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients.Analysts broadly project Neulasta sales to topple over the coming years as biosimilars chip away. In 2017, the consensus models $3.92 billion dropping to $3.43 billion in 2018. By 2025, Wall Street sees just $1.74 billion in Neulasta sales.RELATED:Teva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedBreakout Watch: Top Funds Buy This Biotech IPO With 196% GrowthHow This Small Biotech Could Ruffle The Market In Migraine Drugs

Alnylam stock got a 4.9% boost to 85.71. Meanwhile, IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group ran up 1.4%.The trend saw biotechs outperform major indexes, including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, which were up less than 1% apiece. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) popped 1.4% as the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) got a 1.9% lift.Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, says the spike is continuing from a June pop as generalists began returning to the space. Shares in the biotech sector have broadly risen 12% since the beginning of June. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR) jumped 1.4% on Wednesday.""Last year, there was almost $7 billion in outflows in the biotech funds,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""It was reported the week of June 28, there was $1.71 billion in inflows into biotech funds and that's a huge outlier number.""IBD'S TAKE: There are six biotech and drug players in buy range. Head to the Investing Action Plan for a closer look at what's coming up Thursday.The uptrend followed reports that Trump is working on a draft executive order that would ease drug prices through reduced regulations and a speedier Food and Drug Administration approval process. Recently, Bio Century reported that order would come out before the end of June.But the trouble with politics, Loncar says, is they tend to be fluid. About the same time that rumors of the potential order emerged, there was a Senate hearing on drug pricing. Loncar called it ""a totally unproductive and very political meeting (where) not much was accomplished.""Drug pricing ""is a bipartisan issue and Congress is going to have something to say about it as well,"" he said. ""An executive order from the White House is very meaningful. But it's not going to be like waving a magic wand over that issue and making it go away.""Consumers are understandably angry, he said. Over the last several years, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Mylan (MYL) and privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals have come under fire for their drug-pricing practices. At the same time, the new GOP regime is working to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.Still, the president doesn't look likely to take a hard line on drug prices, Loncar said.""A lot of the leaked details (of the rumored executive order) were actually very positive for the sector,"" he said. ""Increasing innovation and speeding up FDA approvals, having better trade negotiation terms with other countries as ways of lowering drug prices.""He added: ""That's a very constructive way of thinking about it — and all of those are points the companies agree with.""RELATED:Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears BreakoutWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideBiotechs Hit Pause On 5-Day Rally As Regeneron, Bluebird Topple

83,MYL,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

84,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) stock toppled 2% midday Tuesday after receiving a warning letter from the FDA describing ""significant violations"" in its manufacturing processes at its India facility.Until Mylan corrects the violations, the FDA said it could withhold approval of any new applications or supplements listing Mylan as the drug manufacturer. The letter was dated April 3, but was posted early Tuesday.According to the FDA, Mylan failed to thoroughly investigate unexplained discrepancies or failures of some batches of drugs that didn't meet its specifications. The firm also ""failed to establish an adequate quality control unit"" to review production records.During the first six months of 2016, Mylan invalidated 101 out of 139 — or about 72% — initial out-of-specification assay results without sufficient investigation to determine the root cause of the failure, the FDA wrote in its letter.Mylan is working with the FDA to address the two issues raised in the letter as ""comprehensively and expeditiously as possible,"" the company told Investor's Business Daily in an email.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it outperforms just north of half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for the full rundown.""As FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes with a deliberate, thorough approach to assure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities,"" Mylan said in its statement.The Nashik, India, facility is just one of Mylan's 50 manufacturing sites across the globe with 24 focused on oral solid doses. Production is ongoing and Mylan doesn't expect any supply issues related to products being manufactured at the India site, Mylan said.Before the FDA inspection, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the U.K. inspected the India facility and said Mylan met the good manufacturing practice minimum standard.Mylan stock fell 2%, to close at 38.45.RELATED:Will This Biotech Survive Activist Investor — Or Get Taken Over?Mylan Topples After Big Med Player Divests 63% Of Its SharesMylan Stock Dips On Recall Of 81,000 EpiPens Outside U.S.

85,MYL,"Mylan's (MYL) embattled EpiPen saw increased competition in the first quarter — including from its own cheaper alternative — and on Wednesday the No. 2 generic drugmaker reported first-quarter sales that lagged Wall Street views, though profit topped by a penny.For the first quarter ended March 31, Mylan reported adjusted income of 93 cents a share, up 22% and beating the consensus view for 92 cents. Sales advanced 24% vs. last year to $2.72 billion, but missed analysts' model for $2.84 billion.EpiPen sales dragged on net sales from Meda and the topical business, both acquired last year. Mylan said EpiPen sales declined due to increased competition and the launch of its own cheaper, generic version. But Mylan didn't specify sales figures.Mylan drew widespread scrutiny last year on the $600 price tag for its EpiPen two-pack, a fivefold increase over a decade. In December, Mylan released its generic version which costs up to half the price of the original.IBD'S TAKE: Generic drugmakers crashed earlier this month after federal officials searched Perrigo's offices related to a large price-fixing investigation that's also looking at Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Mylan. Get the full story at IBD Industry Themes.The EpiPen has long dominated the anti-allergy market. But private drugmaker Kaleo is looking to take a chunk of that and, in February, reintroduced its competing drug, Auvi-Q, to the market. Sanofi (SNY) bought Auvi-Q from Kaleo, but pulled it from shelves in 2015, citing dosing issues.On the stock market today, Mylan rose 0.5% to 38.21 after falling intraday to 36.79.RELATED:Mylan Says No Supply Issues Related To FDA Warning At India Plant
"
86,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) said Thursday it increased the price of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone to partially offset a 4% dip in global first-quarter sales — but shares fell as total revenue missed Wall Street's views.On the stock market today, Teva stock rose 2% to 32 after earlier falling as much as 3.7%. Shares are down for the year amid an antitrust probe into generics including Teva, Mylan (MYL) and Perrigo (PRGO).For the first quarter ended March 31, Teva reported adjusted income of $1.06 a share on $5.63 billion in sales. Profits topped by 3 cents, but declined 14% year over year. Sales missed the $5.68 billion view, but grew 17% vs. last year.Generic medicine sales of $3.1 billion grew 24% and comprised 54% of total sales, up from the 51% chunk it represented in the year-earlier period. Teva noted its acquisition of Actavis helped boost the segment in the quarter. Revenue from Teva's specialty drug unit declined 6% to $2 billion.Teva blamed lower sales of its central nervous system and respiratory drugs for the decrease in specialty medicines. To help offset that, Teva received a $75 million payment from a Takeda subsidiary which bought the royalties and rights to multiple myeloma drug Ninlaro.Copaxone, though, saw 4% fewer sales in the quarter. In the U.S., revenue for the multiple sclerosis drug fell 5% to $782 million ""partially offset by a price increase of 7.9% for both Copaxone products in January 2017,"" Teva said. Teva sells 20-milligram and 40-milligram doses of Copaxone.IBD'S TAKE: Generic drug stocks toppled last week after federal officials searched Perrigo's offices as part of a widespread price-fixing investigation. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper look at the companies facing Department of Justice scrutiny.Outside the U.S., Copaxone revenue grew 2% to $188 million, but Teva faces looming Copaxone competition. In February, a Delaware court ruled invalid four key patents protecting the drug, siding with Mylan. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) are working on Copaxone copies.Respiratory products also toppled 17% in the first quarter, bringing in $304 million in revenue. Sales from asthma inhalers ProAir and Qvar declined 30% and 27%, respectively. Teva noted that wholesaler and retailer inventory reductions, as well as net pricing effects, played into the dips.Teva also said Michael McClellan will serve as interim chief financial officer, effective July 1, following the planned departure of Eyal Desheh. Before joining Teva, McClellan had a 20-year-plus career at Sanofi (SNY).RELATED:Mylan Q1 Revenue Falls Short Of Views As EpiPen Sales DeclineTeva Downgraded On Lost MS Drug Patents, DOJ Probe

87,MYL,"Generic drug stocks crashed Wednesday on news the Department of Justice has conducted a search at Perrigo's (PRGO) offices related to a widespread price-fixing investigation that is also looking at Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).In early trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell a collective 4.5% to a two-week low. Lannett Company (LCI) and Perrigo stocks lost the most, down 18.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Lannett missed third-quarter earnings estimates late Tuesday.Perrigo declined to comment beyond a press release, which confirmed authorities executed the search warrants at Perrigo's corporate offices.""As has been previously disclosed by a number of companies, the (Justice Department's) antitrust division has been looking at industrywide pricing practices,"" Perrigo's release said. ""The company is taking this investigation seriously and is cooperating with the appropriate authorities.""The investigation centers on potential price collusion among a dozen companies. It's illegal for companies to agree on a set price or corporate discounts. In Perrigo's case, the Justice Department is looking at the price of its skin drugs, Bloomberg reported.Other drugmakers under investigation are Allergan (AGN), Impax Laboratories (IMPX), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP), a subsidiary of Par Pharmaceutical.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with pharma news by visiting IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Mylan told Investor's Business Daily last year it received a subpoena regarding doxycycline, an antibiotic, but hadn't been asked for information on the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure drug. It was also searched.In January, Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, two former executives at generic drug maker Heritage Pharmaceuticals, pleaded guilty to a price-fixing agreement with other drugmakers.RELATED:Teva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock DivesKite, Ionis Outplay Med Sector As Perrigo, Tenet, Valeant DivePerrigo Shares Plunge On Plan To Sell MS-Drug Royalty Stream

88,MYL,"Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) and Depomed (DEPO) stocks plunged Thursday after a Mizuho analyst slashed her price targets on a slew of drugmakers including No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler cited risky guidance for her price-target cuts on Teva and Depomed stocks. She is more bullish on Dermira (DERM), a skin-care firm, but trimmed her price target on prescription trends in dermatology. Eagle stock, meanwhile, is too ""expensive,"" she said.On the stock market today, Depomed stock fell 2.3% to 10.39 and Eagle 3.3% to 73.89. Teva stock lost 0.9% to 28.71, but Dermira stock rose 1.2% to 27.85. Koffler sees Dermira as a takeout candidate in 2018.Koffler cut her price target on Teva stock to 25 from 29, and kept her underperform rating. She cited ""expectations of contraction via further asset sales, general pricing pressure, Copaxone (issues) and minimal pipeline contribution.""She removed sales of laquinimod from her model. Laquinimod was being developed to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but failed in a recent trial, forcing Teva to focus instead on laquinimod in primary-progressive MS and Huntington's disease.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with the drugmaking industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Meanwhile, Teva is likely to experience more pressure against its blockbuster MS drug Copaxone. In January, a district court judge tossed out four of five patents protecting the drug, opening Teva up to competition from Mylan (MYL), Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA).Koffler kept a neutral rating on Depomed stock, but cut her price target to 11 from 13, noting a weak long-term outlook in the opioid market. Depomed makes pain-management drugs including Nucynta.Though first-quarter sales and profits missed expectations, Koffler likes ""the pragmatism of new CEO Arthur Higgins, who made rapid decisions to stabilize product declines and lower operating expenses."" Lowered guidance for 2017 now feels more achievable, she said.Eagle stock, on the other hand, is just too expensive, Koffler wrote in a note to clients. It's unlikely to be a takeout candidate in 2017, so Koffler cut her price target on shares to 57 from 66. Like Teva, Eagle stock also has an underperform rating.For the first quarter, Eagle reported consensus-topping revenue and profits that met. But Koffler lowered her expectations of a 2017 takeout to 20% from 40%, noting uncertainties associated with its chemotherapy Bendeka and a likely slow ramp for Ryanodex in exertional heat stroke.But Dermira grabbed bullish views. Prescription trends in dermatology are currently soft, so Koffler cut her price target on Dermira stock to 40 from 42, though she is buy-rated on shares noting she views ""the company as an attractive 2018 takeout candidate.""Dermira stock sold off recently after an unexpected convertible debt financing, but Koffler expects the stock to rebound on its ""innovative pipeline"" and the potential for a takeout. The stock now looks derisked from any additional financing in the next year, she said in a note.RELATED:Did Neurocrine Just Leave The Door Open For Teva In Tourette's?Can Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To MarketTeva Pharma Q1 Sales Lag As key Multiple Sclerosis Drug Topples

89,MYL,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) is aiming to save $21 million annually by cutting loose 20% of its workforce, the drugmaker said after a judge invalidated four patents protecting multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra.But the cuts could have been — and still might be — much deeper, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich wrote in a note to clients Thursday. He cut his price target on Acorda stock to 18 from 19, but kept his neutral rating on shares.""Acorda has previously spoken of a cost-saving contingency plan that would be enacted if Ampyra's long-term patent protection was lost,"" he said, adding he had ""assumed the first round of cuts would be deeper and a second round could come around the time of the generic launch next year.""Wall Street has long suspected companies like Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) are waiting in the wings to make a copy of Ampyra. Ampyra is approved to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis. It brought in $493 million in net 2016 sales.Trbovich estimates 120 of Acorda's 597 employees, as of Feb. 20, will be laid off within the month. Acorda said the majority of the head count reduction would take place in April with an expected $8 million in severance and related costs.Layoffs are not expected in the 100-person sales force, Trbovich said. The cuts are disproportionately expected to effect the research and development department. Restructuring is expected to save $5.25 million every three months beginning in the second quarter.Restructuring will allow Acorda to refocus on Parkinson's disease drugs CVT-301 and tozadenant. Acorda will also work to push Ampyra 10-milligram extended-release pills through July 2018, when they lose patent protection.""Over the last several years, we have strategically diversified our portfolio and we believe that CVT-301 and tozadenant can be a platform for significant future growth,"" Chief Executive Ron Cohen said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda Therapeutics has an IBD Composite Rating of 14, meaning it underperforms more than eight in 10 of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

90,MYL,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) divested more than 60% of its stake in Mylan (MYL) stock, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, prompting Mylan shares to dip Friday.Abbott sold 44 million shares at $41.60 apiece, documents filed late Thursday show. The divested portion represented 63% of Abbott's share in Mylan stock. Now, Abbott owns 25.75 million shares, or 4.81% of Mylan's total outstanding shares.Mylan stock traded down 1.55% to 40.96 on the stock market today. Shares are forming the latter portion of a cup-with-handle that began in August. The stock fell just below its 200-day moving average on Friday, trying to hold support at its 50-day line. Abbott stock, on the other hand, dipped 0.1% to 44.73.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan announced a generic version of its EpiPen several months ago, but it's facing competition from Impax Laboratories and Kaleo. Head to IBD's Technology page for predictions on the rivalry.Shares closed down a fraction on Thursday after Mylan confirmed it recalled 81,000 EpiPens from countries outside the U.S. after two devices failed in emergency situations.

91,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) stock toppled in premarket trading Thursday after the No. 2 generic drugmaker recalled 81,000 EpiPens in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Japan due to device failure, according to media reports.Mylan stock finished 0.2% near 41.60 on the stock market today, after closing up a fraction on Wednesday. Mylan stock is creating a handle on a cup-with-handle formation that began in August.News of the recall first emerged late Wednesday following reports of two EpiPens failing to work in emergencies, Reuters said. Both patients were able to use an alternate EpiPen to provide the lifesaving allergy shot, Mylan told IBD.The two EpiPen failures follow three months after Mylan announced a generic version of its branded allergy shot. Mylan has come under fire for the price of its EpiPen two-pack, which has risen 500% in recent years to $600. The generic version of the drug costs half that.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 67, meaning it outperforms two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

92,MYL,"DepoMed (DEPO) stock tumbled to a low Wednesday not seen since a year ago, after the company pre-released negative first-quarter guidance and saw its chief executive resign amid a management shake-up and a U.S. senator's probe into opioid marketing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, DepoMed shares fell 3.1% to 13.79, after earlier falling as much as 5%. Shares hit an intraday 12-month high in late September but are down nearly 50% since then.Late Tuesday, DepoMed guided to $95 million to $100 million in first-quarter sales, lagging analysts' broader views by $15 million. That guidance will be revised May 8, during the Q4 conference call.The company also announced a management shift that saw Arthur Higgins replace former CEO James Schoeneck. Gavin Molinelli and William McKee were also added to the board.Higgins, Molinelli and McKee are aligned with activist investor Starboard, which is known for its big stake in HP Enterprise (HPE). Following the shake-up, only three of the nine board members are legacy members, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler noted in a report.DepoMed's board changes also followed reports earlier in the day that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is seeking marketing information, sales records and studies from manufacturers of top-selling opioids in the U.S.McCaskill says sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. DepoMed was named the fifth top seller of opioids in a CNBC report. Other leaders listed include Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Mylan (MYL).IBD'S TAKE: DepoMed isn't the only company facing activist investors. Analysts say Bristol-Myers Squibb could be bought if pressure mounts from investors such as Carl Icahn. Who would bid on Bristol? Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive.Still, DepoMed sold only $190 million in opioids in 2015 vs. the industry leader, Purdue, which made $1.5 billion off its OxyContin drug, a well-known painkiller, according to Janney analyst Ken Trbovich.Trbovich sees the investigation posing little risk to DepoMed, which didn't begin selling opioids until acquiring Lazanda in 2013 and Nucynta in 2015, ""at which time diversion and abuse of prescription opioid medications was decreasing.""Koffler, of Mizuho, sees DepoMed being taken out.""With Starboard remaining involved, we have raised the expected probability of takeout from 30% to 50%,"" she said. ""This generates a hypothetical $16 takeout value for the stock, and may still allow Starboard to record a modest gain on its initial investment.""Alone, DepoMed is worth 10 to 13 per share in a takeout due to lower sales estimates, she said. But Koffler cut her views for this scenario to 50% from 70%. She also trimmed her price target on DepoMed stock to 13 from 16, but kept her neutral rating.Janney's Trbovich has a buy rating on DepoMed stock.RELATED:DepoMed Downgraded On Weakness In Base Business, Stock Run-Up

94,MYL,"No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is likely to recapture market share from Impax Laboratories (IPXL) with its generic EpiPen during ""back to school"" shopping in July through September, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said Tuesday.Mylan expanded its patient assistance programs in the aftermath of September's EpiPen price controversy, brought on by the company bumping the cost of a two-pack of EpiPens to $600. Since then, Mylan has also launched a generic version at half the cost.The generic EpiPen has captured 12.3% of the market as of the week ended Feb. 17, Koffler wrote in a research report. Meanwhile, Impax's generic Adrenaclick has seen its share stabilize at around 26% for the past five weeks.""We expect the market dynamics to continue improving for Mylan into Q3 2017 when seasonal buying is at its highest, and note that comparisons should be much easier in 2017 after market disruption last year,"" she wrote.Mylan expects EpiPens to represent 6% of its sales in 2017 before declining to 5% in 2018. Koffler models $743.6 million in 2017 EpiPen sales, then a decline to $646 million in 2018. Those expectations follow the relaunch of Kaleo's highly priced Auvi-Q on Feb. 14.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 62 out of a best-possible 99, in measuring growth metrics like increases in revenue and profits. It's ranked third in the generic drugmakers group, but none of those stocks are very highly rated. For better stock ideas, head to IBD's Stock Checkup.Heading into Q4, Koffler is bullish on Mylan. The company is slated to report its fourth-quarter metrics midday Wednesday as part of its investor day in New York. Analysts broadly expect Mylan to report $3.17 billion in sales and $1.42 earnings per share excluding certain items.""We view Mylan as one of the best-positioned large generic players, but investors are still quite concerned about sector headwinds and (are) searching for a bottom signal,"" Koffler said. ""The March 1 Mylan call and investor day could prove reassuring if management provides a stable longer term outlook and realistic revenue and earnings targets for 2017.""Analysts currently model $5.33 adjusted earnings per share on $12.64 billion in sales for 2017. Koffler views $12.3 billion in sales and $5.63 earnings per share.

95,MYL,"Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused health insurers took another leg down on Friday as the divide among House Republicans over the bill to replace much of ObamaCare appeared to narrow.Among hospitals, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.3%, Universal Health Services (UHS) 1.7%, HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.3% and Lifepoint Health (LPNT) 1.8%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 2.5%, falling close to a 28-month low, while Centene (CNC) slipped 1.6%.Other insurers were faring better on Friday, with Anthem (ANTM) rising 0.1% and Dow industrials component UnitedHealth (UNH) 1.2%.After sinking on Tuesday after the release of the House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, hospital stocks had recovered the past few days. Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick noted that the apparent willingness of President Trump to back conservatives who want a faster phaseout of the Medicaid expansion might get the bill over the top in the House.The White House clarified Friday that it supports phasing out the Medicaid expansion after 2020, as the current AHCA would do. But that didn't help health stocks.Drug companies and biotechs including Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) also sold off on Tuesday as Ryan's bill was scrutinized. But that was likely due to a Tuesday morning Trump tweet: ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!""On Friday, Teva shares were up 1.3% Friday on the stock market today, while Mylan edged up 0.4%.Overall, markets were holding onto modest gains after a sizzling February jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were all up 0.2%-0.4%, although the Dow and other major indexes were on track to break a string of four straight weekly gains.In a research note, Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said the upbeat assessment from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise offers something of a wake-up call to health care investors.""It has become clear that hospital investors were assuming that there was very little chance of a draconian repeal bill passing,"" Skolnick wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.That still leaves plenty of doubt about how anything resembling the House bill can get enough support in the Senate. Five GOP senators have expressed serious concerns about unwinding the Medicaid expansion, let alone on the expedited basis that House conservatives want to see.Skolnick notes that Trump's support will carry a lot of weight in the House, but that may not be as true for senators in states like Maine and Colorado, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump. In Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman far surpassed Trump's vote tally.Yet Skolnick is sticking with her bottom line that repeal and replace gets done. ""To be clear, we don't think the GOP can go home in 2018 without passing repeal, no matter how bad, no matter whether it's full repeal or not.""And Skolnick does think that any bill that emerges will be bad for the hospitals she covers: ""We see increased adverse selection in the individual market, reduced Medicaid funding in the long term, collapse of exchanges that currently work and soaring numbers of uninsured as creating real potential for pressure on hospital cash flows that likely hit hospital valuations in the next two years.""RELATED:Three Reasons TrumpCare Isn't Killing Hospital, Insurer Stocks Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal

96,MYL,"President Trump harped on drug prices in a tweet early Tuesday, prompting generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) to dip, even though the House's proposal to replace ObamaCare doesn't touch drug prices.""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry,"" Trump wrote in a tweet before the open Tuesday. ""Pricing for the American people will come way down!""Drug and biotech stocks broadly dipped in response. At the close on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company generic drugs industry group was down 1.2% after falling as much as 3.8% earlier, touching a five-week low.Shares of biotech and specialty drug companies fell nearly 1.5%. One of the biggest stock losers was specialty drug firm Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which was down 11.3%. Supernus, however, also settled a patent dispute with Zydus Pharmaceutical over marketing of the generic version of Supernus' seizure treatment, Trokendi. Zydus will be the only company allowed to market the drug under certain circumstances starting in 2023.Also falling were shares of Endo International (ENDP) down 4.4% to 10.90, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), plunging 5.6% to 11.71.Trump's specific method of targeting drug prices via competition wasn't immediately clear Tuesday after the House released an early version of a bill to replace Obama's linchpin legislation, the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech leader Celgene could breakout on a major breakthrough. Head to IBD's Stock Analysis for a deeper dive.Dubbed the American Healthcare Act, the Republican proposal would end the individual mandate, bringing the penalty for not having health insurance down to $0. The proposal would also repeal the medical device tax.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted the latter point would be a positive, in general ""as a majority of device companies have been reinvesting the benefit from the current temporary repeal of (the) device tax.""This could be a potential boon for med-tech makers like Medtronic (MDT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which make heart valves.But the bill still has a long way to go before making its way to Trump's desk, Evercore analyst Terry Haines wrote in a research report. It will need near-unanimous support from House and Senate Republicans where Democrats will likely be in opposition.""We are only at the beginning of the legislative process on part of ACA reform,"" he wrote. ""We continue to think that the end of June is a realistic target.""The document released late Monday is merely the tax and revenue portions of the ACA repeal. Congress will use the budget reconciliation process — requiring only a majority in both houses — for this portion, Haines wrote.Broader ACA reform will probably not be finalized this year.""It will need some bipartisanship to succeed,"" he wrote. ""Today, none is apparent but we are in early days.""RELATED:How To Quickly Find Top-Rated Stocks Near A Buy Point

97,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) woes are set to deepen in 2017 as generic-drug prices are projected to topple 7% to 10%, Argus analysts John Eade and Katelyn Bayone said Tuesday as they downgraded the stock.Shares are trading at 10-year lows after falling 7% over the past quarter, where the S&P 500 saw a 7% increase. Over the past year, Teva stock lost 38% as the index gained 21%, Argus analysts wrote. In the stock market today, Teva fell 1.1% to 35.02 and is right at its 50-day moving average, but the stock has been below its 200-day line for more than a year.Argus downgraded Teva stock to hold from buy, citing a ""plague"" of problems. Teva recently lost four of five patents protecting multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, and former CEO Erez Vigodman stepped down amid a DOJ investigation and bribery scandal in Russia, Ukraine and Mexico.Despite the Copaxone patent losses, Teva kept its 2017 guidance for $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion in sales and $4.90 to $5.30 earnings per share excluding certain items, which would be up 10% and flat, respectively. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta (MNTA) are working on a Copaxone copy, though they are facing manufacturing issues.Teva cut its expectations on full-year sales of Copaxone by $1 billion to $1.3 billion and expects that to have a 75-cent to 95-cent impact on EPS minus items. The company is appealing the patent losses, but interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg, on the company's earnings conference call this month, said to expect continued price erosion amid generic competition.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 32, meaning it underperforms more than a third of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Ani Pharmaceuticals leads the group with a better CR of 85, out of a best-possible 99. Visit IBD's Stock Checkup for other leaders. Meanwhile, Teva is still among a slew of generic-drug makers, including Mylan (MYL), facing a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation. In addition, Teva in December agreed to pay $519 million to the U.S. government to settle allegations that it bribed officials in Russia, Mexico and Ukraine. A similar probe is ongoing in Israel.Risks are stacking up at Teva, Argus analysts wrote in a research note. On top of those struggles, Teva must repay more than $21 billion in debt over the next five years, including $5.3 billion due in 2018. Among other things, Teva is paying for its acquisition of Actavis' generics business.Former generics CEO Sigurdur Olafsson stepped down in December. Olafsson was ""well-regarded"" at Actavis, Argus analysts said, and had held positions with the company since 2003. He was expected to be instrumental in the integration of Actavis' generics business, Argus analysts said.In the aftermath of the Actavis generics acquisition and as Copaxone sales are hit by generic competition, Argus says Teva could engage in M&A to grow. But ""it is likely to face antitrust hurdles"" and ""there are few (if any) attractive large targets,"" the analysts wrote.RELATED:Momenta, Pfizer Give Teva Pharma Breathing Room On Generic MS DrugTeva Maintains 2017 Guidance Despite Copaxone Patent Losses; Q4 TopsTeva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock Dives

98,MYL,"No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is expected late Wednesday to report a third consecutive quarter of sales growth, as well as earnings that will re-accelerate after the company dipped into the red in Q3.Mylan's Q4 report will come amid a week chock full of health-sector earnings, including biotech Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) on Tuesday and eye-care firm Glaukos (GKOS) on Wednesday. Horizon Pharma (HZNP) and Perrigo (PRGO) are slated to report their Q4 earnings on Monday.For Q4, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Mylan to see $1.42 in earnings per share minus items on $3.18 billion in sales, up 16% and 28%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS fell 3% in Q3 after 11 quarters of growth.As part of its investor day in New York, Mylan will also issue guidance for 2017. Analysts currently view sales as growing 15% to $12.7 billion and EPS minus items up 12% to $5.33.Mylan stock is up 10% for the year, well above its 50-day moving average, after a rough 2016 that saw the stock tumble 29% as CEO Heather Bresch was forced to defend a bump in the price of its EpiPen two-pack to $600. Shares fell 0.4% Friday to 42.16.IBD'S TAKE: Glaukos filed its initial public offering in August 2015, and is among several stocks outperforming the S&P 500. Head to IBD's IPO Analysis for a deep dive on Glaukos and its fellow outperforming stocks.Before year's end, though, Mylan introduced its generic EpiPen at half the cost of the branded two-pack.Also late Wednesday, glaucoma and cataract surgery firm Glaukos is slated to report $29.8 billion in sales and break-even EPS ex items. Sales are expected to grow 47% year over year. The company lost 7 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.Glaukos stock hit a record high of 46.82 on Tuesday. Shares rose 2.9% Friday to 46.19.Late Tuesday, analysts expect Supernus to report 25 cents EPS ex items, up 79%, with revenue rising 36% to $59.5 million.Supernus stock fell 0.2% Friday to 25.30, after touching an all-time high of 27.95 at the start of the month.RELATED:Momenta, Pfizer Give Teva Breathing Room On Generic MS DrugAcorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect Ampyra: RBCTeva Dives To 10-Year Low After 4 Copaxone Patents Invalidated

99,MYL,"Momenta (MNTA) and Pfizer (PFE) are unexpectedly giving Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) some breathing room on a generic version of MS drug Copaxone after a manufacturing delay announced late Friday for a Teva rival drug — prompting Teva stock to rebound Tuesday.In the stock market today, Teva stock lifted as much as 7.8% to a six-week high of 37.94, closing Tuesday's regular session at 36.64, up 4.1%. Momenta stock, on the other hand, tumbled 15% to 16.05, crashing below its 50-day moving average. Momenta is partnering with Novartis (NVS) subsidiary Sandoz on the generic drug. Novartis stock slipped 0.21% Tuesday to 77.04.The Food and Drug Administration issued Pfizer a warning letter following an inspection of one of its fill/finish factories. That factory is a key piece of Momenta/Sandoz's supply chain for 40-milligram Glatopa, the generic rival to Copaxone.Momenta says it's unlikely the FDA will approve the 40-mg drug in Q1.""Under FDA policy, an approval of the application is dependent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations at the Pfizer facility used to make the final product,"" Momenta said late Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Teva stock is ranked ninth in IBD's 17-company generic drugs industry group with a Composite Rating of 28 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup for a list of the top five generic drugmakers.Analysts broadly pushed back their timelines for Glatopa's 40-mg launch to Q2 and Q3. The letter doesn't restrict the production or shipment of 20-mg Glatopa already marketed by Sandoz in the U.S.The delay could also put Mylan (MYL) and partner Natco in the lead on generic filing, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in a research report. She has an underperform rating and 27 price target on Teva stock.""Mylan previously indicated to us that the Copaxone first-filer status is shared, which may unexpectedly put Mylan's molecule in the lead if it can gain FDA approval ahead of Momenta,"" she wrote. ""We currently model both generic launches in the second half of 2017.""Mylan stock edged up 0.59% Tuesday to 42.30.Koffler expects Momenta's 40-mg Glatopa to launch in Q3 and Mylan's product in Q4.RBC analyst Randall Stanicky called the delay on Glatopa 40-mg opportune for Teva.RELATED:Acorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect AmpyraTeva Maintains 2017 Guidance Despite Copaxone Patent Losses; Q4 TopsTeva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock Dives

100,MYL,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) must keep its patents and stave off generic competition from Mylan (MYL), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Roxane to extend protection of its MS drug Ampyra out to 2026, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Tuesday.The biotech sued 10 companies over their plans to file generic versions of Ampyra, and is still awaiting a decision over whether it can keep any of its five patent protecting the drug. A decision is expected in the first case any day now. IPR could go until March 11.""If they lose either court case or IPR (inter partes review) case, then Ampyra could see generics enter in 2018, since (the) court case defines if generics are infringing and the IPR defines if they can even keep the patent,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Acorda stock jumped 6.5% to close at 25.40 on the stock market today, after toppling 2.3% on Tuesday.Acorda early Tuesday reported $140.6 million in sales for Q4, topping consensus views for $138.7 million and rising 7.4% vs. the year-earlier period. Acorda wrapped up the quarter with 5 cents earnings per share ex items, down 82% and missing views for 10 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is outperforming IBD's biotech group, up 23% year to date vs. a 10% rise in the 425-company industry group. Get some insight into Incyte's potential blockbusters via The New America.Much of the discussion during Acorda's earnings conference call with analysts centered on ongoing Ampyra litigation and whether to include Ampyra in 2017 models. For 2017, Acorda sees $535 million to $545 million in Ampyra sales.Acorda says the generic litigation with three remaining filers is ""too close to call,"" according to Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum. He sees 50/50 odds that Acorda will win its case against Teva, Mylan and Roxane. Acorda will adjust its 2017 view if its loses either court case.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich sees Acorda having a better than 50% chance of a positive outcome, but remained neutral on Acorda stock on Wednesday. The downside risk if he's wrong ""is simply too great,"" he wrote in a report.Still, there's some strength in Acorda's pipeline. Analysts broadly expect CVT-301, a Parkinson's drug, to be approved in 2018. Last week, Acorda unveiled good results from a phase 3 trial. Acorda plans to present more data on secondary endpoints in June.But Acorda's access to the migraine market could be limited with CVT-427 which, in a study of pharmacokinetics and pulmonary safety, showed reversible bronchoconstriction in smokers and asthmatics. CVT-427 could advance to phase 2 by year-end.Its label might shrink, though, Janney's Trbovich said.

101,MYL,"A federal court in Delaware ruled invalid four key patents for Copaxone, the top-selling multiple sclerosis drug for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA).Israel-based Teva Pharma fell 9% in late trading, hitting what be its worst levels since 2006. Teva shares fell 0.2% to 34.52 on the stock market today. Teva has been in a downtrend since July 2015.The court sided with Mylan Labs, which rose slightly in late trading.Teva said it would appeal the ruling.
"
102,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) made a fortune, and stirred controversy, while getting EpiPen allergy shots stocked in schools across America.Now the drugmaker wants to sell EpiPens to restaurants, sports venues and potentially even Boy Scout troops — by setting up its own pharmacy to cut out middlemen and by lobbying for new laws that could expand sales of its biggest product.The plan, obtained by Bloomberg News through public records requests, would bypass small-town pharmacists and chains like CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) and let Mylan sell the drug directly to public places. The company is looking to revitalize EpiPen sales that began slumping last summer, when Congress questioned Mylan over EpiPen's sixfold price increase since 2007.""It's extremely smart,"" said Mark Baum, founder and chief executive of San Diego-based Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (IMMY), which supplies drugs directly to patients. ""There's no rationale for other middlemen getting in the way. That's just driving up the cost to customers.""Sales of EpiPens fell in the third quarter as the $600 price tag sparked a furor that included questioning of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch by a congressional committee. Since mid-August, shares have fallen about 20%. Last month, Mylan said it would cut fewer than 10% of its employees.Mylan declined requests for interviews with executives, but Bresch has made no secret of its strategy to push for state laws to allow so-called entity prescriptions — drugs sold to places rather than people.""We are continuing to open up new markets, new access with public entity legislation that would allow restaurants and hotels and really anywhere you are congregating, there should be access to an EpiPen,"" Bresch said at a September 2015 conference.In October, Mylan said it reached a $465 million settlement with the U.S. government over accusations that it overcharged the Medicaid program by classifying the EpiPen as generic, instead of a brand-name drug, in order to pay lower discounts.Mylan's new business plan could revolutionize an industry whose layers of middlemen, critics say, cost customers money. The country's more than 600,000 eating and drinking establishments, plus thousands more sports venues, amusement parks and movie theaters, could be a gold mine for Mylan.More than 15 million Americans have food allergies, and a severe reaction sends a patient to the emergency room about every three minutes, according to Food Allergy Research & Education.In 2015, EpiPens brought in $912 million with an operating profit of $498 million, Mylan said in a regulatory filing. If half of America's restaurants bought an EpiPen two-pack each year at a full price of $608, Mylan would generate about $180 million more in annual sales. Last month, the company began selling an authorized generic two-pack for $300.EpiPens, which deliver shots of epinephrine that can stop severe reactions to bee stings and food such as peanuts and shellfish, have been provided free to 67,000 U.S. schools, Mylan said. Schools can also buy additional EpiPens at a discount.Laws in 48 states allow schools to stock and administer epinephrine injectors. Mylan spent about $4 million in 2012 and 2013 to help get federal legislation passed to encourage states to stock the devices in schools, according to lobbying disclosure forms filed with the U.S. House of Representatives.Now the company is trying to replicate that campaign. Since 2013, Mylan has funneled thousands in campaign contributions to state lawmakers, according to campaign finance disclosures and documents posted on Mylan's website.Already, at least 30 states permit entity prescriptions beyond schools. Before Mylan's involvement, no states had enacted such legislation, the company website says.Ohio State Representative Christina Hagan, who sponsored a bill there, received a $1,000 donation from Mylan last year. Hagan said working as a waitress taught her the gravity of food allergies.The Republican said she was unaware of Mylan's campaign contribution. The bill was unanimously approved.Frank Minear, owner of Frank's Family Restaurant in Alliance, Ohio, said he plans to buy an EpiPen because he has shellfish and items containing peanuts on the menu.While most severe allergic reactions happen at home, 6% occur at restaurants, according to a 2014 study.""I look forward to being one of the first restaurants in Stark County to supply the EpiPen in case it's needed,"" Minear said. ""It's a lifesaving thing.""Mylan said its pharmacy, Mylan Health Management, would be used to distribute EpiPens only to entities and not to individuals, according to the company's pharmacy license applications obtained by Bloomberg News. Mylan first disclosed the existence of the unit in a securities filing last year, without providing any details, and Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, reported on it in October. The pharmacy was created for ""future opportunities"" and isn't operating, Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email.Prescriptions to restaurants and other entities would likely be cash purchases, so Mylan wouldn't have to pay rebates to drug-benefit managers, like it does for prescriptions covered by insurance.And with its own pharmacy, Mylan could keep the entity prescriptions from migrating to cheaper generic competitors that might emerge in the future. Its website describes a new ""Mylan On Location"" program to help businesses ""offer immediate care in emergency situations.""Mylan might save $40 to $55 in pharmacy and distributor fees on each $600 EpiPen prescription, according to Michael Rea, CEO of Overland Park, Kansas-based Rx Savings Solutions.By cutting out middlemen, Mylan ""can offer an EpiPen for $200 or $250, give the market a $350 discount, and make the exact same profit,"" Rea said.Mylan's approach could backfire, said George Sillup, chairman of pharmaceutical and health care marketing at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. Someone without proper training ""could inflict some harm or injury,"" he said.Training requirements vary by state. The American Red Cross offers a 30-minute online course for $20.Pharmacist Brad Arthur, who owns two drugstores in Buffalo, N.Y., and is a past president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, said he would applaud the program despite its threat to his livelihood.""It's this kind of disruption in the pharmaceutical pricing model that we're ripe for,"" Arthur said.

103,MYL,"Marathon Pharmaceuticals faces an uphill battle developing Mallinckrodt's (MNK) Synacthen in the U.S., analysts said Thursday, after Mallinckrodt agreed to pay $100 million and license the drug in two indications to end an FTC antitrust probe.In the stock market today, Mallinckrodt stock rose 3.4% to 48.10, after falling as much as 13.7% Wednesday on news of the FTC investigation. Shares closed down 5.9% on Wednesday after earlier touching their lowest price since November 2013.Per the settlement, Mallinckrodt will pay $90 million within 10 days, an additional $10 million within 90 days and $2 million to reimburse four states' fees. It will also license Synacthen, a synthetic ACTH, to Marathon for treating infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome.Mallinckrodt didn't admit to any wrongdoing, but said settling removes ""the distraction of litigation."" The company can still market Synacthen for other indications across the globe, and it's working to develop the drug as a potential treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump has accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" in how they price their products. Last week, stocks tanked on additional pledges from Trump to ease the prices of pharmaceuticals. See IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.Ironically, the FTC investigation stems from a 2014 suit by former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli, who alleged that Questcor acquired competing drug Synacthen from Novartis (NVS) in 2013, only to shut it down and then jack up the price on its own drug. Acthar. Mallinckrodt now owns Questcor.Synacthen has been on the market outside the U.S. for decades. Questcor came under fire in 2008 for bumping the price of a vial of Acthar to north of $29,000 from $1,235. Last year, a vial cost $35,000. The FTC was investigating whether the Synacthen acquisition was to keep Acthar prices high.Shkreli, though, has been the poster boy for the drug-pricing debate. As Turing's CEO, he acquired Daraprim, an anti-parasitic, and spiked the price to $750 per pill from $13.50. Mylan (MYL), too, has drawn ire from its price boost on EpiPens to $600 for a pair from about $100 when it acquired the product in 2007.Analysts seemed unconcerned Thursday that Mallinckrodt would have to license the competitive drug in two indications. IS and NS aren't key areas for Mallinckrodt outside the U.S. and it will be difficult, if not impossible, for Marathon to gain FDA approval for use of the drug on babies, Mallinckrodt said.""This would entail convincing patients or the parents of infant patients in fragile, high-risk populations to forgo existing approved, effective treatments and enroll in an experimental protocol where they risk receiving less effective treatment or no treatment at all,"" Mallinckrodt said in a statement.In a conference call with analysts early Thursday, Mallinckrodt executives said they ascribed zero value to IS and NS when they acquired Questcor, according to Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler. The settlement isn't expected to have an impact on Acthar sales.Koffler kept her buy rating and 85 price target on Mallinckrodt stock. But the stock remains a ""conspiracy theory,"" despite its attractive valuation, until Mallinckrodt can diversify outside Acthar, she said. The firm said at a recent investor gathering it plans to pursue accretive acquisitions to that end.RELATED:Celgene CEO: Drug-Pricing Debate Hinges On Incentives For Innovation

104,MYL,"In his first news conference since his surprise win, President-elect Trump on Wednesday indicated the issue of escalating drug prices would be a priority, using harsh words to describe the situation.""Our drug industry has been disastrous,"" said Trump. Drugmakers must be subject to ""new bidding procedures because they're getting away with murder,"" he said, hitting on an issue that already had been getting increased attention from federal and state lawmakers.Mylan (MYL) CEO Heather Bresch was skewered in a House committee in September, but plenty of others have been heavily criticized, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Mylan and Teva, which acquired generic drugmaker Actavis last year from Allergan (AGN), were the two publicly traded companies among six companies that in December were sued by the attorneys general of 20 states on price-fixing charges in the field of generic drugs. A day earlier, in its first action in its similar investigation, the U.S. Justice Department charged the former CEO and president of privately held Heritage Pharmaceuticals with price fixing.IBD'S TAKE: An event such as a news conference from a president-elect can move stocks. See IBD's Stocks on the Move to learn the latest big movers, both up and down, with a number of drugmakers currently on the moving-down list.In an interview with Time, when named that magazine's Man of the Year, Trump pledged to bring down high drug prices, but Wednesday marked his first substantive comments on the subject.""Pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs,"" he said at the news conference. ""We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly, and we're going to start bidding, and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.""Actavis had boosted the price of its hydrocortisone tablets by 9,500% over a number of years, while Mylan's EpiPen to treat allergic reactions saw a 700% price increase in six years ended last year. Both products treat potentially life-threatening situations.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) ETF fell 3% in the stock market today to 277.94 and falling back near its 200-day line.Already depressed, shares of Mylan and Teva fell 4.3% and 2.6% respectively on Wednesday, while Valeant tumbled 6.5%.IBD's 421-company biotech industry group fell 3.1%, again falling to its 50-day and 200-day lines.Among larger biotech stocks, Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) fell 8.1%, Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) plunged 7.4% and United Therapeutics (UTHR) fell 6%.Among larger drugmakers, Amgen (AMGN) ended the day down 1.4%, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) fell 3.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell 1.7%, with Biogen (BIIB) tumbling 3.6%.RELATED:Trump: Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder'Mylan, Teva Sued For Alleged Price-Fixing

105,MYL,"SAN FRANCISCO — Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back Tuesday against so-called social contracts with patients, like that of Allergan (AGN), in the face of the drug-pricing debate that spiked last year on Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen and Turing Pharmaceuticals' HIV medication.""The debate is not new, it's just new because of social media,"" he said. ""Many pharma companies have become public in proclaiming free access programs. ... It's interesting because those principles have been at play at Celgene for years.""Speaking at a media panel Tuesday at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Alles outlined a series of programs at Celgene to offer less expensive or free access to Revlimid, a key chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and mantle cell lymphoma.Alles estimated that 6% of Celgene's medicine goes to patients for free each year. To subsidize that, as well as reinvest in R&D — CFO Peter Kellogg says Celgene reinvests north of 35% into R&D when accounting for partnerships — the company must hike prices each year.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 5 out of 420 companies in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. To see which companies lead the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""People think lowering prices is the answer (to the drug-pricing debate),"" he said. ""What if that meant we no longer had the threshold to provide access to patients who don't have a safety net?""The trouble is, Celgene isn't alone in annual price hikes. Last July, the Wall Street Journal found that drug prices had jumped about 10% vs. year-earlier figures. Alles says a number of factors are at play. Complicating matters, consumers generally don't understand the costly drug-development process.For instance, to run a ""pivotal,"" late-stage trial costs $100 million, on average. If the drug fails, the firm could be out millions, Alles said.""We welcome comprehensive transparency and look forward to how that evolves,"" he said. ""Incentives have to exist for companies to take risk to create returns.""Biopharmas and generics alike can't simply agree to prices — that's illegal, Alles noted. Late Monday, a pair of former Heritage Pharmaceuticals executives admitted to a price-fixing scheme between April 2013 and December 2015 involving a generic antibiotic and a diabetes drug, according to Philly.com.Ex-CEO Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, former senior vice president of commercial operations, pleaded guilty in a federal court in Philadelphia to conspiring to manipulate drug prices. Federal investigators are also looking at Mylan, Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and four other drugmakers under suspicion of price-fixing.""We can't do as an industry what people want us to do,"" Alles said. But, he assured, ""no one in the U.S. is paying list price for drugs.""Celgene shares fell 0.2% to 119.98 on the stock market today. Celgene, working on a consolidation with a 127.10 buy point, rose 0.5% on Monday as it raised its 2017 profit forecast.

106,MYL,"No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL) won't hit its 2018 earnings goal organically, Citigroup analyst Liav Abraham predicted late Wednesday, adding that Mylan's limited cash will reduce its M&A options.Mylan is targeting $6 earnings per share ex items in 2018, up 86% from 2015. The consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Mylan to pull in $4.74 and $5.37 EPS ex items in 2016 and 2017, respectively.Abraham prefers Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) as a cheaper stock buy with a more robust pipeline. Teva is the No. 1 generic drugmaker, by market cap.""We remain skeptical regarding the attainment of this (Mylan) target in the absence of inorganic activity,"" he wrote in a research report. ""The company's cash flow generation/cash flow conversion has historically been volatile and could decline going forward as EpiPen profitability declines.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug prices have come under increasing scrutiny during and in the wake of the 2016 election. But UnitedHealth isn't sweating Donald Trump's pledge to curb spiraling prices. Get the full scoop on IBD's New America.Abraham downgraded Mylan stock to neutral from buy and cut his price target to 44 from 59, citing limited upside on revised earnings expectations. In the stock market today, Mylan stock fell 1.2% to 39.16. Shares fell 29% in 2016 as Mylan took a ton of heat on Capitol Hill for the escalating prices of its EpiPen injector used to treat people with possibly life-threatening allergic reactions.Mylan is taking on GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), angling to deliver a generic version of GSK's asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) behemoth. British GSK pulled in 1.59 million pounds in Q3 in respiratory sales alone, comprising 39% of total sales despite generic competition.The generic from Mylan has a Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) date of March 28. Abraham sees a 70% chance Mylan will get Food and Drug Administration approval.""We do not underestimate the importance of generic Advair to Mylan,"" Abraham wrote. But ""we note GSK's pricing flexibility for Advair, which may limit the opportunity for Mylan and other generic players (such as Hikma) to gain market share.""Sandoz, a subsidiary of Switzerland-based Novartis (NVS), is also in on the generic Advair fight. In October, Sandoz filed a citizen's petition in an effort to persuade the FDA to hold off approving a generic Advair until the drug can meet certain requirements.RELATED:Allergan Outlook Improves On Good Trial For Colon Drug: Credit SuisseDrastic Drug-Price Action No Trump Card, Says Needham Mylan Launching Cheaper EpiPen Generic Amid Drug Pricing Saga

107,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) is prepping to cut up to 10% of its workforce as it integrates two years' worth of acquisitions, including Swedish Meda Aktiebolag and Renaissance Pharma's topical and generics business, the generic drugmaker said late Tuesday.The company declined further comment to IBD beyond an 8K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission describing ""restructuring programs in certain locations"" to streamline operations globally.""Since 2015, the company has made a number of significant acquisitions, and as part of the holistic, global integration of these acquisitions, the company is focused on how to best optimize and maximize all of its assets across the organization and across all geographies,"" Mylan wrote in its SEC filing.Less than 10% of the workforce will be affected across all geographies and businesses, Mylan said. Mylan, the No. 2 generic drugmaker by market cap behind Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), has about 35,000 employees, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 44, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

109,MYL,"Mylan (MYL), Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and four other drugmakers were sued Wednesday on allegations of conniving to fix generic drug prices — only hours after the DOJ charged two former Heritage Pharmaceuticals execs of the same crime.The lawsuit came to light Thursday, pitting 20 state attorneys general against Mylan, Teva, Heritage, Aurobindo Pharma, Citron Pharma and Mayne Pharma. The drugmakers are accused of fixing the prices of doxycycline hyclate, an antibiotic, and diabetes med glyburide.Heritage is characterized as the ""principal architect and ringleader of the conspiracies."" The heavily-redacted complaint outlines activities by former Heritage CEO Jeffrey Glazer and ex-President Jason Malek to allegedly manipulate drug prices.In 2013, Heritage entered the Doxy market, competing against Mylan which was the sole Doxy manufacturer at the time. The AGs alleged Heritage and Mylan agreed to abstain from competing for Doxy patients, instead splitting the market.IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks have slumped as of late on recent comments by President-elect Donald Trump that he would tackle rising drug prices.""The objective was to avoid a price war which would reduce profitability for both companies,"" the attorneys said in their complaint. ""Mylan agreed to 'walk away' from at least one large national wholesaler and one large pharmacy chain to allow Heritage to obtain the business and increase its market share.""Heritage planned in 2014 to increase its price on glyburide, according to the complaint. Its rivals at the time were Aurobindo and Mayne.""In order to accomplish this objective, Malek instructed members of the sales team to immediately reach out to their contacts at each competitor on the list of drugs, and attempt to reach agreement on the price increases,"" the complaint states.According to the complaint, the defendants knew their actions were illegal and, thus, agreed to avoid or delete written communications.Heritage declined to comment on the lawsuit, instead referring to a statement Wednesday that noted Malek and Glazer were fired in August following an internal investigation.

Allergan in May received a U.S. Department of Justice subpoena seeking information about its Actavis generics unit, though liability transferred to Teva (TEVA) when it acquired Actavis in August. That's part of an ongoing, wide-ranging DOJ investigation of possible price collusion in the generics field.This month, the DOJ charged former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and President Jason Malek with felony counts related to conspiring to fix prices for a diabetes drug and an antibiotic drug.

112,MYL,"Outspoken former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli said the national outrage over drug pricing was blown out of proportion and heightened by the U.S. presidential election, although he conceded he could have predicted the blowback better.""In terms of regret, maybe not seeing that as acutely would've been a minor regret,"" Shkreli said during an interview on Bloomberg TV Friday. ""But because the price increase has stuck, so to speak, I don't really, that's the main mission — which was to raise the price and have it generate increased revenue — that's happened, so I'm happy with respect to that.""Privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals AG is among the companies under fire for price increases on older drugs that lack competition. Along with Mylan (MYL), the maker of emergency allergy shot EpiPen, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX), these companies have been questioned by Congress and subjected to criticism by the public.Turing and Shkreli were among those included in a U.S. Senate committee report released this week that called for the government to stop a ""monopoly business model"" employed by some drugmakers to raise prices on some drugs.A former hedge fund manager who posts on Twitter frequently, Shkreli became the face of drug outrage after Turing raised the price of Daraprim — which fights a sometimes-deadly parasitic infection — by more than 50-fold. He left Turing after being charged by federal authorities on an unrelated matter.Asked if he would take the same business strategy again, the 33-year-old said, ""Of course."" He conceded that he put the drug company he ran at risk with his brash approach. But he also called Daraprim ""one insignificant drug"" compared with other, larger products. Shkreli said he was frustrated and that 'the government in many ways is an apparatus of vengeance.""He said the pricing situation was ""blown out of proportion,"" and he mentioned Valeant and Pfizer (PFE), the world's second-largest-drugmaker, as other companies who have raised prices recently. Turing did not respond to requests for comment.He also said he's made many fans in the business world. ""Everybody's doing it. In capitalism you try to get the highest price you can for a product,"" he said.He was at turns thoughtful and sarcastic during the interview, asking Bloomberg anchors David Westin and Jonathan Ferro, ""I don't know if you're familiar with health care insurance,"" and saying patients don't feel the brunt of price increases. While drugs make up about 10% of overall health care spending in the U.S., insurers often implement cost-sharing with patients and increase the premiums patients pay in response to long-term rising costs.Federal prosecutors have accused Shkreli of defrauding investors in the hedge funds, and of using $11 million of Retrophin assets to pay them off. He also allegedly hid his control in the company's unrestricted stock to help pay off his debts. He was arrested in December 2015 and has pleaded not guilty.He said he's looking forward to the upcoming trial, scheduled for June.""We're going to win by a landslide,"" he said. ""The evidence is clear that I did nothing wrong.""Shkreli is known for his blunt opinions in an industry that often tries to present a unified front. During a congressional hearing on drug prices in February, he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights as a way of refusing to answer questions, then after the hearing called lawmakers ""imbeciles"" on Twitter.During his trial, Shkreli predicted that jurors will see somebody they can relate to, not the figure he claims he's been portrayed as in interviews.""Invariably, when people read the headline about Martin Shkreli, they hate Martin Shkreli. When they get to know Martin Shkreli, they love Martin Shkreli,"" he said.During the TV interview, Shkreli brought up the $1 billion federal fraud case against the co-founder and several associates of hedge fund Platinum Partners. The U.S. has accused Platinum of a Ponzi-like scheme. Platinum co-founder Mark Nordlicht pleaded not guilty this week.Shkreli said he had 'tangoed"" with the hedge fund over a trade, before investigators brought the case, and called the investigations and charges an example of what the government should go after. After his interview on Bloomberg, he declined to comment on whether he had spoken to federal investigators about the Platinum case.

113,MYL,"President-elect Trump has promised action on high drug prices, but prospects of government taking control of drug pricing ""has largely subsided"" thanks to Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, Needham said in an bullish research report Thursday on the specialty pharma sector.Furthermore, Trump's stated plans to lower corporate taxes and lessen the tax burden of U.S. companies looking to bring cash back to the U.S. should spark drug industry M&A, Needham analyst Serge Belanger wrote in his research report.Belanger named ACAD Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) and tiny Corium International (CORI) at the top picks in his specialty pharma coverage area.In an interview with Time early this month, when he was named the magazine's Man of the Year, Trump gave his most definitive statements yet on the long-simmering issue of escalating drug prices. ""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks haven't been booming, but see which health care-industry related companies make the latest IBD 50 ranking of stocks that have performed the best in the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.The comments hurt drug stocks. But while drug pricing will remain an issue, Trump didn't expand on those comments in that interview or subsequently, Belanger told IBD via email, after we asked if the analyst could amplify on his report.""Even with Trump's comments, the idea of the federal government negotiating drug prices rather than insurers seems far-fetched now,"" Belander said in his email. ""We assume that pricing scrutiny of generic and old drugs will continue — PBM/payers (pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers) have been active in this area.""But while ""there had previously been talk from the Democrats of having Medicare and other agencies negotiate their own drug prices much like the VA and Medicaid do now ... pricing control of newly approved drugs seems less of an issue now with Republicans having across-the-board control.""Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) are among the few companies that have received the most heat from consumers and lawmakers for escalating drug prices.The Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion among makers of generic drugs, with companies such as Mylan, Allergan (AGN), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Endo International (ENDP) among those being investigated.In its first charges in that investigation, the DOJ this month charged former Heritage Pharmaceuticals CEO Jeffrey Glazer and President Jason Malek with felony counts related to conspiring to fix prices for a diabetes drug and an antibiotic drug.The next day, the attorneys general of 20 states sued Mylan, Teva, Heritage and three other drugmakers on price-fixing allegations.Besides less threat of drastic drug-price actions, Belanger sees a much-improved climate for mergers and acquisitions in the sector.""Drivers of increased M&A activity for 2017 and beyond are likely to be some of the proposed tax policy changes of the new

116,MYL,"As promised, Mylan (MYL) announced Friday that its generic version of its own EpiPen injector — which will cost about half the price of its existing EpiPen — will reach pharmacies next week.Mylan and its EpiPen have become the last poster boys for the issue of rapidly escalating drug prices. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch got skewered in a House committee hearing in September, with lawmakers asking questions about Bresch's own pay and her use of a private plane to travel to the hearing. Bresch is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).The cost of a two-pen EpiPen pack has risen to $600 from about $100 in 2007. It's used to treat often life-threatening allergic reactions caused by insect bites, food, drugs and more.""Americans are rightfully concerned about rising drug prices, and now more than ever patients and families across this country are standing at the pharmacy counter struggling to pay for their medications,"" Bresch said in the company's announcement Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The pricing issue has weighed on drug stocks, but some groups are doing well. Find out which groups are on the upswing by regularly checking in with IBD's in-depth Industry Snapshot feature.The issue will remain on the front burner. While President-elect Trump had not been expected to focus on drug pricing as much as on easing the drug-approval process, he said in a Time magazine interview published this month: ""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""On Thursday, Mylan was among six drugmakers sued by 20 state attorneys general on allegations of fixing the prices of two generic drugs. Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) also was among those sued. Teva and Mylan are the two largest generic-drug makers by market cap. In a statement on that news, Mylan said that ""to date, we know of no evidence Mylan participated in price fixing.""Thursday's news followed Wednesday's announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice that it had charged the former CEO and former president of New Jersey-based Heritage Pharmaceuticals of colluding to fix generic drug prices. The charges were the first in a two-year DOJ investigation of drug price fixing. The DOJ is looking at Mylan, Teva and a group of companies that includes Allergan (AGN) and Endo International (ENDP). They have all disclosed receiving subpoenas.The AG suit revealed Thursday had named Heritage as the ""principal architect and ringleader of the conspiracies.""Mylan stock, down 30% this year, rose 0.2% to 37.86 in the stock market today. Teva, down nearly 45% this year, lost 0.65% to 36.49.Bresch, in Mylan's announcement Friday, said problems will remain until ""the pharmaceutical pricing system is reformed to address the increasing shift of costs directly to consumers. Pharmaceutical pricing is too far removed from the patient at the pharmacy counter and not designed for today's increasingly consumerized health care system.""The ""authorized generic"" EpiPen Auto-Injector has a wholesale acquisition cost of $300 for a two-pack. Mylan said releasing a generic version vs. the company's own product is ""an unprecedented action.""So, why would anyone chose the more expensive, nongeneric EpiPen?""Depending on several factors — for example, a patient's health insurance — the out-of-pocket cost for EpiPen Auto-Injector may be a more affordable option,"" Mylan spokeswoman Julie Knell told IBD via email. ""Mylan continues to offer both options for patients so that they can work with their health care professional to determine the best, least expensive option for them.""RELATED:Mylan, Teva Sued For Alleged Price-FixingDOJ Charges Pharma Execs With Price-Fixing

117,MYL,"Drugmaker Actavis faces fines for raising the cost of hydrocortisone tablets by more than 12,000%, British antitrust regulators said Friday as they continued a crackdown on excessive pricing in the pharmaceutical industry.The division of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) ""broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices in the U.K.,"" the Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement. In one example, The company raised the price of the 10 milligram packs from roughly 88 cents to $110 in U.S. currency. Teva, which acquired Actavis for $40.5 billion from Allergan (AGN) earlier this year, said it will ""defend the allegations.""""This is a lifesaving drug relied on by thousands of patients, which the (U.K.'s National Health Service, or NHS) has no choice but to continue purchasing,"" said Andrew Groves, CMA senior responsible officer. ""We allege that the company has taken advantage of this situation and the removal of the drug from price regulation, leaving the NHS — and ultimately the taxpayer — footing the bill for the substantial price rises.""The CMA sent Actavis a statement of objections laying out its concerns amid a wider crackdown on unfair drug pricing. On Dec. 7, the CMA fined Pfizer (PFE) and Flynn Pharma a record amount for abusing their dominant position by charging unfair prices for unbranded versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug.The regulator fined Pfizer roughly $105.2 million and Flynn Pharma $6.5 million after they increased prices by as much as 2,600% in September 2012. The price increases occurred after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium.Teva, which is already in the process of selling Actavis's U.K. operations to Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., said the CMA probe raises broader questions about the regulation of generic medications.Although the pricing of the Actavis product ""under investigation was never under Teva's effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health,"" Teva said. ""Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies.""A statement of objections can often lead to fines or orders to change business practices. The regulator has the power to fine companies found to have abused a dominant market position up to 10% of their annual revenue.Hydrocortisone tablets are used as the primary replacement therapy for people whose adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of natural steroid hormones, resulting in conditions such as Addison's disease. The tablets are also used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood, hormone and immune system disorders, skin and eye conditions, breathing problems, cancer, and severe allergies.Actavis also increased the price of 20 milligram hydrocortisone tablets by nearly 9,500%, resulting in charges to the NHS of $128.32 per pack by March 2016, the CMA said. The NHS had previously paid the equivalent of $1.34 per pack.Before April 2008, the NHS spent about 522,000 pounds a year on hydrocortisone tablets. By 2015, NHS spend on the tablets had risen to $87.4 million a year.Steep price hikes have put a string of drugmakers under the microscope in the U.S. with companies like Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX). bearing the brunt of the public outrage. President-elect Donald Trump, who had been cited as a boon to free-market health care, also declared himself an opponent of high drug prices in an interview with Time magazine.

But uncertainty lingers on whether he will repeal the Affordable Care Act. Get IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop.But Koffler says that $6 EPS target won't happen without small acquisitions along the way. She kept her buy rating on Mylan stock, but cut her price target to 47 from 49. She also trimmed her EpiPen view to $827 million for 2016 from Mylan's earlier guidance for $1.1 billion.EpiPens suffered inventory destocking and a generic launched by Mylan this year, in response to the criticism. For 2017, Koffler expects $827 million in EpiPen sales, representing 6.6% of total sales. There will likely be rebates on the generic, but Mylan says it can cut direct-to-consumer spending, coupons and copay deals.""We still believe that Mylan will be able to capture a significant portion of the market with its generic and also to expand overall market growth,"" Koffler wrote.On the stock market today, Mylan shares sank 2.9% to 36.47. Shares touched a more than three-year low of 33.60 on Nov. 3.RELATED:Could Trump 'Make Drug Development Great Again'?Mylan Third-Quarter Earnings Fall Short, But Stock Steady

125,MYL,"An interview with Time upon his selection as the news magazine's Man of the Year brought President-elect Trump's most definitive statements to date on drug prices: ""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""The incoming president, though, has been short on details. And many observers say his bigger focus will be to streamline the U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval process. That effort got a boost on Wednesday, the same day Trump's Time interview was published, when the U.S. Senate approved a bill aimed at speeding up approval for drugs and medical devices. President Obama is expected to approve the so-called 21st Century Cures bill.But just what actions Trump will take remain as unknown as any resolution to the issue of drug prices that, at times, jump exponentially despite the critical needs of patients.Trump has vowed to repeal President Obama's Affordable Care Act. And he's promised to ""drain the swamp"" of special interests in Washington that helped contribute to the rise of Big Pharma.Before the Time interview, though, he hadn't broached the drug pricing issue, which just after his election boosted drug stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnologg ETF (IBB) jumped 12.6% in the two days after the Nov. 8 election, but it's fallen 8% since. IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped 9.7% on Nov. 9, while the generic and ethical drug groups rose 7% and 5.7%, respectively. The groups have given back those gains.Trump can't ignore rising drug prices, says Trevor Williams, Penn Mutual Asset Management managing director. The trouble is that the businessman and reality TV star is a relative political enigma, Williams told IBD.""It's hard for me to see him being a champion (of lowering drug prices) in the same sense Hillary would have been because he's so focused on dismantling the ACA,"" Williams said. ""But with Trump not having a political history, it's really difficult to telegraph where he's going to go with it.""Some of his policy proposals, though, could be telling.Trump pledged in a ""Contract with the American Voter"" to fully repeal the ACA, better known as ObamaCare, within his first 100 days in office, replacing it with Health Savings Accounts. In that vein, he said he'll cut down on FDA ""red tape.""""There are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications,"" Trump wrote in his contract.Trump's crack at the FDA is nothing new, says Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. Yet, in recent years the FDA has worked to expedite sorely needed drugs through its Fast Track Designation and with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which helps fund drugs quickly.Still, there is a backlog in approvals of generic drugs, Divan told IBD. Many proposals in the works have targeted making the approval process for generic drugs — cheaper drugs similar to drugs out long enough that they've lost their patent protection — much easier.Trump's platform would remove barriers to entry for ""safe, reliable and cheaper"" products. Trump could also allow broader and off-label use for a number of drugs, Penn's Williams said.His replacement plan for the ACA remains somewhat ambiguous. Trump has backed off earlier promises to fully repeal the act. For one, he says he'll maintain provisions that require insurers to cover patients with pre-existing conditions and let parents cover their children through age 26.Obama didn't touch pharmaceuticals much in his ObamaCare legislative centerpiece, says Divan, outside of requiring drugmakers to pay for some of the expanded health care coverage. If Trump completely does away with the ACA — which is unlikely, Divan says — some of those fees could disappear.""Backroom negotiations (for the ACA) let the companies come out reasonably well,"" Divan said. Repealing the ACA could put the cash from those fees back into drugmakers' pockets. Yet, Wall Street is anything but reasonably sure how Trump-care could affect biotech and drug firms.Trump doesn't appear to have any vendetta against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), but drugmakers might. PBM tactics undercut Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in Q3, prompting both stocks to topple in late October after Amgen offered dim 2017 views and Eli Lilly saw diabetes sales take a hit.PBMs are third-party administrators for commercial, government and Medicare health plans. PBMs use discounts and competition to keep drug prices low, which can help patients but raise conflicts with drugmakers.Amgen stock toppled nearly 10% on Oct. 25 after its Q3 sales of immunosuppressant Enbrel came in flat. The firm, though, said it doesn't expect any net selling price increases in 2017. The business will be driven on volume, Amgen executive Anthony Hooper said on the company's earnings conference call.IBD'S TAKE: Rebates chipped away at Amgen's Enbrel sales in Q3. What does this mean for the broader industry? Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Eli Lilly stock on Oct. 25 after its Q3 sales of diabetes drug Humalog fell 14% ""as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices,"" the company said in its earnings conference call, after EPS and revenue missed Wall Street targets.Trump's lack of commentary on PBMs could be telling, Divan told IBD. As it stands, the government is not involved in drug price negotiations. But Trump could work to change this in order to lower drug prices. That's not been a focus of Republicans, Divan says, though Trump is not your typical Republican.The question, he says, is whether ""the new administration willing to go after something (Big Pharma) politically to score some points with the general public?""Drug companies have their own views, of course. Merck (MRK) CEO Ken Frazier this month, in a Bloomberg interview, said his company has been ""restrained"" in raising prices.""There will always be an individual drug in an individual year that you can point to and say, 'That looks large in relation to others.' But if you look at the whole portfolio, you will see that Merck has tended to be rather restrained when it comes to drug prices,"" Bloomberg reported Frazier saying.Bloomberg also reported this month that Allergan (AGN) CEO Brent Saunders said Trump could ""be more vicious, more focused, on taking down whoever does something again"" in terms of spiking the price of a drug or drugs. Bloomberg had interviewed Saunders and Frazier after both appeared at the Forbes Healthcare Summit in New York on Dec. 1.There's no question patients have had it with high drug prices.The Kaiser Foundation found in September that 77% of Americans, up from 72% last year, believe drug prices are too high. Americans generally support requiring firms to release information on how prices are set and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices.Kaiser's survey followed a drug pricing controversy that erupted in September over Mylan (MYL) boosting its price on a pair of EpiPens to $600 from about $100 in 2007. Its CEO, Heather Bresch, was subjected to tough questioning at a House committee hearing.Last year, a similar controversy prompted Capitol Hill hearings involved Turing Pharmaceuticals and its former CEO, Martin Shkreli, involving big hikes on a decades-old HIV drug. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has also imposed huge hikes on drug prices.The U.S. Justice Department is investigating and is expected to file charges against some generic drug companies for price collusion before year's end.Yes, while analyst Divan says ""I don't think the issue is going away,"" he also says he sees fewer chances of big changes to drug pricing policies under Trump.RELATED:Pfizer's Q3 Sales Challenged By Eli Lilly, Novartis Amid Breakup BustEli Lilly Topples As Alzheimer's Darling Sola Fails; Biogen, Merck DownCelgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Lilly Alzheimer's FlopAlder Keels For Sixth Day After EU Upholds Teva Migraine Patent

126,MYL,"President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress will likely seek faster drug pipelines, buoying Medidata Solutions (MDSO) and other medical software firms, KeyBanc analyst Donald Hooker said Monday, as drugs stocks rose again.The emphasis on faster pipelines will come amid reduced drug pricing scrutiny and Trump's plan to incentivize repudiating cash to the U.S., Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in a separate research report. He predicts a Trump presidency will likely keenly boost the biotech sector.On the stock market today, Medidata stock helped lead IBD's 17-company Computer Software-Medical industry group, which was up 1%. Medidata stock was up 4.2% to 55.53, its seventh straight gain. Hooker has an overweight rating and 65 price target on shares, and he says the macro backdrop has improved for Medidata following Trump's election.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks have flown on Trump's win, but uncertainty exists in his intentions for the Affordable Care Act. Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full skinny.""Rising drug prices have become a major political issue this year,"" Hooker wrote in a research report Monday. ""Instead of price controls, we suspect that Republican solutions will more likely involve regulatory reforms that speed up approvals on new drugs and create greater competition.""Trump could ""make drug development great again,"" he quipped.Hooker sees 20% organic growth for Medidata in 2017 given the likely improving regulatory and legislative landscape for information technology in drug development. Medidata has enterprise deals with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Boehringer Ingelheim.IBD's biotech industry group rose 6% the day after the election, though it fell Thursday and Friday. The 421-company group was up 1.7% Monday. IBD's 18-company generic drug group has risen every day since the election, and it was up 2.1% Monday on hopes that Trump regulations could help the industry.Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was seen as tougher on runaway drug prices. In September 2015, the biotech industry saw stocks tumble when Clinton called out former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli for boosting the cost on a decades-old HIV pill.In September, Mylan (MYL) drew national ire after raising the price on a pair of EpiPens to $600, from about $100 in 2007. Mylan, Allergan (AGN) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) are among a handful of drugmakers currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged price collusion.But Trump likely won't push back on drug pricing, MacKay said. Investors are more bullish on the sector given Trump's proposals to incentivize returning cash to the U.S.Still, ""we caution that health care/pricing could be one of the areas where Mr. Trump makes concessions with Democrats,"" he wrote in his research report. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock reacted richly to Trump's election, he noted.RELATED:Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo ResultsMylan Third-Quarter Earnings Fall Short But Stock Steady

127,MYL,"Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is slated to report rising Q3 sales and earnings after the close Wednesday, just four days after it and fellow drug leaders Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Allergan (AGN) plummeted on news of a federal probe into alleged price collusion.For Q3, Mylan is expected to report $1.46 earnings per share ex items on $3.123 billion in sales, up a respective 2.1% and 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter. It would be Mylan's 12th consecutive quarter of sales and EPS growth.EPS is expected to decelerate from 27% growth in Q2, but sales are seen speeding up from 8% growth in the prior quarter. Mylan has beat or met EPS views from the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for seven of the past eight quarters. But sales have only beat twice.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it performs near the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get the Stock Checkup to see which stocks are better rated.Mylan stock is down 30% over the past 13 weeks and touched a three-year low on Thursday, as the company has attracted national ire for its EpiPen prices. In September, CEO Heather Bresch was grilled by a congressional committee about the high prices, with a two-pack of EpiPens priced at $600, up from about $100 in 2007. EpiPens are used to treat severe allergic reactions to insect stings, bites and foods.Over the same time period, IBD's 44-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group has fallen 8.6%, including a 9% nose-dive last Thursday when reports emerged of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into potential price collusion among generic drugmakers.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Mylan stock ended trading up more than 4.5% to 36.59.RELATED:Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo Results

128,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug will likely see generic rivalries crop up in 2017, but the company garnered a stock upgrade Monday on the robust Huntington Disease and chronic migraine fronts.Copaxone, Teva's MS drug, brought in half of the firm's specialty drug sales and 23% of overall sales in Q2. But Teva stock is down 22% since May on investor worry that generics will sock Copaxone sales in 2017.""Given the sell-off in Teva shares since May, we feel most of the risk around Copaxone and the U.S. generics market is now priced into the shares,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday in a research report outlining ""some tricks ahead"" but calling the valuation ""a treat.""Divan upgraded Teva stock to outperform from a neutral, seeing long-term opportunities, but he cut his price target to 52 from 59 on looming competition. Mylan (MYL) is expected to release a 20-milligram generic competitor to Copaxone in 2017 as others prep 40-mg versions.He said potential ""tricks"" from Teva in the near term include its Q3 earnings report on Nov. 15. At that time, he expects the company to lower its guidance to reflect a court decision on Teva's Copaxone patent.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of generic drugmakers are down 25% for the year, but other medical firms are flourishing despite the volatile election season. Glaukos stock, for instance, is up 32% for the year — though its main ""trick"" might not seem like much of a ""treat."" Check out IBD's New America for more.The Q3 conference call might offer some clarity on Teva's acquisition of Actavis and upcoming catalysts including phase-three data for chronic migraine drug TEV-48125 and the likelihood of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a Huntington Disease medication in early 2017.""For generics we believe drug pricing deflation will remain in the expected range while Teva will be able to take advantage of some first-to-file opportunities, extract synergies from the Actavis deal and begin delivering meaningful margin expansion,"" Divan wrote in a research note.In the stock market today, Teva stock rose 0.83% to 42.67, but it's still trading near three-year lows.

Meanwhile, Republicans retained control of both houses of Congress, also easing regular concerns.Drugmakers aren't in the clear. There is still populist anger at prices for new and old treatments, with Trump at times signaling he would also go after drug prices. Meanwhile the Justice Department reportedly is close to filing charges vs. Mylan and other generic drug makers on price collusion.RELATED: Stock Futures Down, But Well Off Lows, As Trump Wins White House

IBD's 44-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group toppled 9%. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL) fell 9.5% and 6.9%, respectively.But Incyte curbed those losses Friday. In the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 5.2% to 87.57, earlier rising as much as 7.1%. The biotechs and generic-drugs groups rose more than 2% and more than 3%, respectively.Incyte's most recent study pooled data from two five-year phase-three studies of Jakafi. The median overall survival (OS) for those who started with Jakafi was 63.5 months. Patients who crossed over from the placebo or from what was the best available therapy (BAT) at the time, saw a median OS of 45.9 months.Correcting for patients crossing over to Jakafi, the control group saw a median OS of 27 months.IBD'S TAKE: Inctye stock is about 10% below a 92.92 buy point achieved Sept. 28 out of a consolidation area, where a decline of 8% triggers the sell rule. Use IBD's stock lists to keep an eye on Stocks Near A Buy Zone.""Thus, these results further support the survival benefit of Jakafi treatment in myelofibrosis (MF), and suggest that earlier initiation of treatment with Jakafi may provide a greater survival advantage for patients with MF,"" RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis wrote in a research report.Simeonidis reiterated an outperform rating on Inctye stock. Incyte will present the full results of its Jakafi abstract on Dec. 4 during the American Society of Hematology annual meeting.Incyte's positive Jakafi data follows its strong Q3 earnings report early Tuesday. Sales grew 44% year over year to $269.5 million and 19 cents earnings per share minus items swung from a 22-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $261.4 million and a 1-cent loss. Incyte's Q3 beat followed rival Novartis' (NVS) Q3 sales miss last week, which prompted the stock to drop 5.8% over the following two days.RELATED:Align, Incyte, GrubHub Among Best R&D Stock Plays: GoldmanIncyte Could Stoke M&A Fire On 'Deep And Durable' Melanoma Drug ResultsBioMarin, Incyte, Kite Get Thumbs Up On Goldman Sachs Upgrade

133,MYL,"Biotechs and drugmakers rallied Friday following a big drop-off Thursday on news that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating a dozen companies suspected of price collusion, including industry leaders Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).After plunging 9% Thursday to a four-month low, IBD's 44-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group rose 3.8% on the stock market today. The group was the second-best performer out of 197 groups.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, meanwhile, rose 2.7% and was the third-best performer.Price collusion is a new challenge for the industry, already wracked by controversies over spiraling prices. It's illegal for companies to agree on a set price or coordinate discounts.In September, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch was grilled by a congressional committee over the sixfold price increase of two EpiPens to $600. Last year, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli drew national ire after raising the price of an AIDS medication by a factor of 56.U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges before year's end, according to anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg. Biotech and drug stocks plunged Thursday following the report.A two-year investigation spans more than a dozen companies including Teva, Mylan, Lannett (LCI), Impax Laboratories (IPXL), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP) subsidiary Par Pharmaceutical. Teva's Actavis unit, acquired from Allergan in August, also has been implicated.IBD'S TAKE: The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF got a nice 3.6% boost Friday, rising on a buyback following the slump Thursday. Other ETFs wobbled as the election season aims for a dynamic close next week. ETFs are a proxy for the broad market. See who's winning on IBD'S ETFs & Funds page.Several companies have acknowledged the DOJ investigation in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.In May, Allergan (AGN) received a DOJ subpoena requesting information about its generics business. Liability has since been transferred to Teva, which acquired Allergan's generic business, Actavis, in August. Teva twice disclosed two subpoenas from the DOJ and Connecticut Attorney General.Allergan declined to comment beyond the previous disclosure and liability transfer. Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told IBD, ""Teva is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas.""Mylan has already disclosed a subpoena regarding antibiotic doxycycline. But there's been no subpoena for information regarding the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure drug. Mylan, Mayne, Par, Actavis, Sun and Lannett all make digoxin. Covis makes Lanoxin, the branded version.""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation,"" spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan told IBD in an email. ""To date, we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Sun Pharma declined to comment beyond saying it would continue to cooperate with the DOJ.Lannett, Impax, Covis, Mayne, Taro and Endo didn't immediately return requests for comment.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan didn't immediately see that the news would create long-term damage outside of a near-term overhang on the stocks. Allergan stock lost 4.6% on Thursday, while Teva fell 9.5%. But Allergan stock rose 3.3% Friday, while Teva rose 2.7% and Mylan 2.5%.The drag on Allergan was inappropriate considering the Actavis sale, he wrote in a research report.

134,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Mylan (MYL), Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP), Lannett (LCI) and other generic-drug makers tumbled Thursday afternoon after Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion, with charges likely by year-end.The DOJ is probing more than a dozen generic-drug makers over whether they colluded on pricing, according to Bloomberg.Mylan issued the following statement: ""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation.  To date,  we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Teva Pharmaceuticals has disclosed subpoenas and is cooperating, Bloomberg added. Lannett also has received a subpoena, the Wall Street Journal said.The antitrust probe is about two years old and covers some two dozen drugs, Bloomberg said, citing sources. A grand jury is examining if executives agreed to raise prices.Teva shares plunged 9.6% to 39.17 on the stock market today, falling to its lowest levels since November 2013. Mylan lost 6.7%. Lannett crashed 26.6%, Endo Pharmaceuticals 19.5% and Akorn (AKRX) 18.1%. Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) fell 7.3%.The DOJ collusion probe news is the latest sign that the drug industry face increasing regulatory and political pressure over prices. Hillary Clinton has vowed to crack down on drug prices, while her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has hit specific drug stocks with negative tweets.And the latest report hit more than just drugmakers.

135,MYL,"Mylan (MYL), taking big heat for the high price of its potentially lifesaving EpiPen injector, late Friday announced it had agreed to a $465 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice about the classification of EpiPen in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.Mylan stock shot up 10% in after-hours trading Friday on the news, though the company also lowered its earnings guidance for the year. The controversy has hurt the stock, which closed Friday at a three-year low.Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch was shredded in a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on Sept. 21 because the price of EpiPen, which treats dangerous allergic reactions, has risen sixfold since 2007, to more than $300 ($600 for a two-pack) for the self-administered product. Mylan became the latest poster child for the huge, ongoing issue of high prices for certain drugs.Soon after criticism mounted, with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton among the critics, Mylan announced it would introduce a generic version at about half the price.Bresch told the panel Mylan's profit per injector came to about $50, but a subsequent Wall Street Journal investigation found the profit was roughly double that, excluding taxes.At the hearing, the panel criticized most everything about Mylan, including the CEO's pay. Bresch's total compensation came to about $19 million last year, but at the hearing she said he compensation was somewhere ""in the middle"" among her peers.""I'm very pro-business, but I am sickened ...,"" Rep. John Duncan, R.-Tenn., said at the hearing. ""The greed is astounding, sickening.""In Friday's announcement, Mylan said the terms of the settlement do not provide for any finding of wrongdoing on the part of Mylan. The release said that ""the question in the underlying matter was whether EpiPen Auto-Injector was properly classified with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (""CMS"") as a non-innovator drug under the applicable definition in the Medicaid Rebate statute and subject to the formula that is used to calculate rebates to Medicaid for such drugs. EpiPen Auto-Injector has been classified with CMS as a non-innovator drug since before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on long-standing written guidance from the federal government.""In addition, Mylan said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 to $4.90 for the year, down from its earlier guidance of $4.85 to $5.15. The company said it lowered guidance most as a ""result of the previously announced changes in EpiPen Auto-Injector access programs and the upcoming launch of the generic to EpiPen Auto-Injector.""

136,MYL,"Mylan's (MYL) half-price version of its EpiPen allergy shot may not be available until the end of the year, the drugmaker said in an email, potentially months after a timeline the company gave in August.The ""authorized generic"" version of EpiPen will be available ""by the end of the year,"" Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email Monday.Five weeks ago, in a statement on Aug. 29, the company said it expected to introduce the generic version ""in several weeks."" Mylan's generic version will cost $300 for a two-pack, about half the brand-version price.""We expect to launch this year once we have assured that sufficient inventory will be available to meet anticipated orders, created the necessary packaging for the product, and created the necessary labeling for the product,"" Devlin said. ""We are diligently working to complete these efforts in order to provide the generic as soon as possible.""Mylan has attracted the wrath of Congress by increasing the list price of the EpiPen more than six-fold since 2007, to more than $600 for a package of two. To quell the growing furor over EpiPen's price, it announced the cheaper authorized generic version.Devlin declined to be any more specific about when the $300 generic version would be available.Drugmakers don't need advance approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to bring an authorized generic product to market, said Theresa Eisenman, an FDA spokeswoman. They do, however, have to notify the agency in an annual report.Pfizer (PFE), which manufacturers the brand version of EpiPen for Mylan, has not announced any manufacturing issue that could delay production of an authorized generic.Last month, at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch faced skeptical lawmakers who grilled her over the drugmaker's profits and executive pay.At the hearing, she said Mylan makes $100 in profit on each pair of EpiPens. But in a Sept. 30 letter demanding more detailed information from Mylan, lawmakers said that figure included tax assumptions that may have underrepresented Mylan's profits.As of Monday's close, Mylan's shares were down 21% since Aug. 19, the last day of trading before lawmakers began questioning the drugmaker's EpiPen pricing. The stock dipped another 0.6% to 37.97 at the close Tuesday.

137,MYL,"Pfizer (PFE) doesn't expect Donald Trump's election and a Republican Congress to ease the U.S. drug-pricing debate, though the firm is optimistic on potential tax reform, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Friday.Biotech and drug stocks have rallied following Trump's election, assuming he'll be less likely to tackle pricing reform than Hillary Clinton. IBD's generic drugs group is up 10% and the biotechs group is up 14% since the election.But Pfizer isn't ready to change its view on postelection pricing, Divan said.The ""debate around drug pricing will not go away and will not get any easier,"" he wrote in a research report. Pfizer has ""not changed any of their assumptions around pricing since the election.""IBD'S TAKE: Drugs and biotechs aren't the only sectors primed for success or failure on the election results. Check out IBD's Industry Snapshot to figure out which stocks might rocket — or tank — under Trump.Drug pricing has been a hot topic for several years. In September 2015, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli drew national criticism after hiking the price per pill on a decades' old HIV drug to $750 from $13.50.In September, Mylan (MYL) CEO Heather Bresch defended before a Congressional committee the company's sixfold increase in pricing on an EpiPen two-pack. Two EpiPens now cost north of $600 from about $100 in 2007.And though Pfizer is optimistic on potential tax reform under Trump's administration, the proposed incentive on cash repatriation is ""a one-time fix."" The key is moving to a territorial system, Divan wrote following his meeting with Pfizer.Politics aside, Pfizer still has a number of catalysts in the upcoming year. Before year's end, the stock could rocket on phase-two data for a vaccine to combat the diarrhea bacterium Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, and on Europe's approval of Xeljanz, an anti-inflammatory/cancer drug belonging to a class called JAK inhibitors, the analyst said.In 2017, Divan expects Pfizer to do well on U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of crisaborole, an eczema drug that was under development by Anacor Pharmaceuticals before Pfizer acquired that firm in June for $5.2 billion.Pfizer also has combination data with Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck KGaA due in 2017 for avelumab and Inlyta for multiple types of cancer.Divan edged up his earnings per share ex items expectations on Pfizer. He now sees Pfizer pulling in $2.54 and $2.66 in 2017 and 2018 from earlier models for $2.51 and $2.65. He reiterated his $2.42 view for 2016.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock dipped 0.85% to 31.46. Shares have been on a six-day downtrend, but still are up nearly 5% since the election.Editor's Note: Corrects third-to-last graph to properly identify the company Merck KGaA, which is unaffiliated with U.S.-based Merck.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Pfizer Spikes On Report Its Mulling $14 Billion Consumer Care Sale

138,MYL,"Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) stock was feeling some Mylan Pharmaceutical (MYL)-like pressure Monday on Congress' looming deadline to submit information regarding an $80,000 price increase for a rare cancer drug.Over the past year, Ariad upped its price on Inclusig to $199,000 annually from $120,000, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research report. Inclusig treats specific classes of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Though Ariad sells 15-milligram and 45-mg bottles, the lion's share of patients (about 40%) are on a 30-mg dose, Yee wrote. The latter has to buy two 15-mg bottles, thus paying double the price.Yee doesn't see much stemming from Congress' pressure. Recently, Mylan agreed to make a generic, less costly version of its EpiPen, a device to treat anaphylaxis during emergency allergic reactions, after hiking the device's cost to $500 from $57.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech earnings season is in full swing with Merck, Eli Lilly, Vertex and Edward Lifesciences slated for Tuesday. IBD recently looked at some biotech giants and whether they can top expectations.Medivation (MDVN), which is being acquired by Pfizer (PFE), felt some congressional heat earlier this year over the $129,000 price tag on its prostate cancer drug. It later got a letter from Sen. Bernie Sanders.Gilead Sciences (GILD) came under some hot water earlier this year when it hiked the price on six of its drugs. But congressional requests for information didn't result in much, Yee wrote.""It's reasonably likely the congressional inquiries will blow over in time,"" Yee said.Ariad has until Nov. 4 to deliver information on the price hike including R&D spending and sales distribution tactics. Ariad has argued Inclusig isn't like Mylan's EpiPen and others.Ariad had ""a 20-year history of financial losses and unprofitability, far higher R&D spend than revenues, and $1.3 billion in historical spending to internally discover, develop and commercialize Inclusig,"" Yee wrote. Orphan drugs tend to be more costly from an R&D standpoint.Yee kept his sector perform rating on Ariad stock. But JPMorgan downgraded shares to neutral from underweight. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Ariad fell 9.7% to 9.37, at a nearly three-month low. Ariad is off 31% so far this month.

139,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) stock jumped Monday, as investors digested the drugmaker's announcement late Friday that it had reached a $465 million settlement with the Department of Justice about the classification of EpiPen in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.""The DOJ settlement removes a significant overhang that had been weighing on the stock,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a mostly upbeat research note Monday, in which he maintained his sector perform rating and 48 price target on Mylan stock.Mylan stock rose 8.2%, to 38.87, in the stock market today, earlier rising above 40 for the first time since Sept. 29. In Friday's regular session, Mylan stock hit a three-year low of 35.58.The $465 million is less than Mylan's 2015 EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes, Stanicky pointed out. The agreement ""will remove any lingering concerns of a larger cash call and ongoing negative headline here and represents an important step in moving forward,"" he wrote.The government has said EpiPen, a potentially lifesaving injector that treats dangerous allergic reactions, should have been classified as an innovator drug, according to rules set up by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and thus, said Stanicky, subject to a higher rebate formula of 24%, vs. 13%.The agreement, though, won't end the heat Mylan continues to face from lawmakers, patients and patients families from the six-fold increase in EpiPen prices since 2007, to $600 for a two-pack. Reacting to the heat, Mylan recently announced a generic version at roughly half the price and in Augustexpanded the eligibility of its patient-assistance program, but the issue of high drug prices isn't going away.Mylan late Friday also lowered its guidance for the year, and Stanicky lowered his own estimates as result, also noting expected competition from a Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) generic rival product that he said would further impact in 2018.""We see sustainable growth for MYL, albeit lower than peers anticipated due to erosion of EpiPen, which has been an important driver ...,"" Stanicky said.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for medical industry winning stocks? A great place to check is the IBD Leaderboard. Only top stocks make this list, and there are never very many. Current Leaderboard stocks, however, include Abiomed and Edwards Lifesciences.RELATED:Mylan Announces EpiPen SettlementMylan Expands EpiPen Discount Program

140,MYL,"Mylan (MYL) was criticized for the profits it makes and the high pay of its executives after the drugmaker repeatedly raised the price on its EpiPen allergy shot, during a U.S. House of Representatives hearing Wednesday on the company's business practices.House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, said he found Mylan's arguments that it makes only about $50 of profit on each pen ""a little hard to believe.""""They're here to tell us they make about $50 profit,"" Chaffetz said in his opening remarks. ""Telling us the middleman makes more than we do. Here's what doesn't add up for a lot of people -- believe me I'm a person who believes in profit, profit motivation -- (but) you have five executives who over five years earned over $300 million in compensation.""Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch appeared before the committee in the latest congressional hearing focused on high U.S. drug prices. The company became a target for outraged lawmakers and consumers after it raised the price of EpiPen, a self-administered injection used to treat dangerous allergic reactions, by about sixfold since 2007.Mylan shares were up 1.6% at the close Wednesday to 41.91. Shares have been consolidating between 38 and 56 since December.At the hearing, the panel's top Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, demanded that Bresch apologize even as he predicted that nothing would change after the hearing, and called for legislation.""Today, we will hold yet another hearing where the industry will take these punches, but then go right ahead and keep raising their prices,"" Cummings said in a prepared statement. ""They will fly back to their mansions in their private jets and laugh all the way to the bank while our constituents suffer, file for bankruptcy, and watch their children get sicker, and in some cases die.""Bresch, who is the daughter of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, tried to make the case to lawmakers that Congress should recognize that Mylan has increased access to the drug. She said in her prepared testimony that Mylan only takes home about $100 after rebates, fees and discounts for each two-pack of the shots.""Looking back, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing minority of patients"" who had to pay the full list price or more, she said in the prepared testimony. ""We never intended this.""The company, which is run from Canonsburg, Pa., but is officially registered in the Netherlands after a so-called tax inversion, is facing a multiple inquiries from lawmakers and law enforcement. The probes include state attorneys general investigating possible Medicaid fraud as well as legislative committees demanding internal documents from the company about EpiPen's price.Cummings didn't offer specific legislative proposals in his statement, though Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has called for a group to review sudden, ""unjustified"" price increases, especially for older drugs.Mylan bought the right to sell and market EpiPen in 2007, from Germany-based Merck KGaA. Since then, it has raised the price of the product from about $50 to more than $600 for a two-pack. It has subsequently said it will introduce a lower-priced, ""authorized generic"" for $300.As Mylan raised the price of EpiPen, it also helped push policies to have schools stock the shot, which is now the dominant epinephrine auto-injector in the U.S. In addition, it has led campaigns to raise awareness of dangerous allergic reactions and to get parents and children to carry EpiPen for rapid use. Cummings said that documents Mylan handed over to the committee show the drugmaker spent $100 million on advertising and marketing last year.

146,MYL,"Stocks rose to early gains Monday as oil prices surged, while the Dow and S&P 500 recovered key support levels.The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq rallied 0.8% each, while the S&P 500 added 0.7%. The Dow and S&P 500 regained their 50-day moving average lines; the Nasdaq is nearing an all-time high. Volume was tracking lighter on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday.Energy, steel and automakers led the upside in the stock market today. Oil stocks got a boost from a more than 1% rise in West Texas intermediate crude prices to $51.03 a barrel on hopes for an output deal as top producers met in Istanbul.Retailers and ethical drugmakers were among the few underperforming groups. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) sank 9% in heavy trade to a near two-year low amid positive clinical trial data from Merck's rival lung cancer drug.Merck (MRK) leapt 2% to lead the Dow, clearing a 64.10 flat-base buy point in healthy trade after announcing positive results on two studies of Keytruda to treat patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.Mylan (MYL) gapped up and rose 10% in robust volume. The drugmaker on Friday reached a $465 million  settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over how it charged Medicaid for its EpiPen allergy medication. Shares of the Netherlands-based company are still 9% and 13% below the respective 50-day and 200-day moving average lines.On the IBD 50, Momo (MOMO) jumped 5% in fast turnover, on track for a new closing high.

148,MYL,"When push came to shove, Mylan (MYL) couldn't find any friends among Republicans, even though they said they wished they could defend the drugmaker.At a congressional hearing in Washington Wednesday, GOP lawmakers who described themselves as ""free market"" and ""pro-business"" said the drugmaker's aggressive pricing of its EpiPen allergy shot — the cost of which went up about sixfold since Mylan acquired it in 2007 — had gone too far. They described themselves as upset both about the price increases as well as Chief Executive Heather Bresch's $19.4 million in awarded pay.""I am a very pro-business Republican, yet I am really sickened by what I've heard about this situation,"" Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., said at the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform session. ""Nobody can really earn or deserve"" that much money, he said.The company has become the latest in lawmakers' sights as both parties have made drug prices a focus of their oversight efforts. Most of the discussion about regulating the industry's pricing practices has been led by Democrats, including presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has a proposal to monitor and push back on increases.The drugmaker certainly isn't the only business Republicans have recently taken to task. Earlier this week, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) was called a ""fraud"" and ""completely out of touch"" by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., after the bank's employees opened accounts without customers' permission.At the Mylan hearing, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., gestured at his colleagues and said many of them had little idea about business or how the corporate world worked. But then he turned to Bresch, and described the company's lobbying efforts on behalf of laws encouraging or requiring schools to keep devices like EpiPen on hand. The shots now cost about $600 for a two-pack, and the vast majority of states now require or encourage schools to stock epinephrine devices.""You came and you asked the government to get in your business, so here we are today,"" Mulvaney said. ""If you want to come into Washington, if you want to come into state capitals, and lobby us to make us buy your stuff, this is what you get. You get a level of scrutiny and a level of treatment that would ordinarily curl my hair, but you asked for it.""Bresch defended the drugmaker, saying that the price increases had helped it fund better patient access and that it actually collects less than half of the $600 list price.""I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing minority of patients"" who may end up paying the full list price, said Bresch, who is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WVa.Mulvaney is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, an ultraconservative group of House Republicans who often break with Speaker Paul Ryan. Committee member Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican, is a member of Congress's Republican Study Committee, a conservative policy group — and took Bresch to task as well.""I think you all have behaved very badly and invited government regulation,"" Farenthold lectured the CEO. ""I am very much for free market. But this whole drug pricing system that we have right now makes no sense to me, and a free market can't operate in a system where people like me, who are consumers, don't understand it.""Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the committee, said he couldn't sympathize with how Mylan was charging hundreds of dollars when the medicine inside EpiPen cost about $1.""Trying to dive into the depths of individual drug pricing was not something I set out to initially do,"" Chaffetz said at the start of the hearing. As Bresch defended her company and said she was surprised by the outrage, Chaffetz asked her, ""You never anticipated this? You raised the price, what did you think was going to happen?""Mylan is run from Canonsburg, Pa., but is officially registered in the Netherlands after a so-called tax inversion. Its shares have dropped 15% in five weeks after lawmakers started raising questions about EpiPen. Shares were up 3% in early trading.

149,MYL,"An election year has added to the pressures that hit biotechnology stocks hard, but a look under the hood of two sibling biotech ETFs is revealing. It shows the more speculative companies in this extremely heterogeneous industry caused much of the hurt.BioShares Biotechnology Products (BBP) is down 1.4% year to date through Oct. 20 and invests in established companies that have brought at least one drug to market.The 35 stock holdings in this exchange traded fund include Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron (REGN).IBD'S TAKE: The largest, cap-weighted biotech ETFs stand to benefit most if these five top companies climb the ""wall of worry"" that has built around the industry.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) is down 31.0% so far in 2016 and invests in young and smaller companies whose drugs are in the experimental-testing stage.Its portfolio includes Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), whose shares rocketed in September after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. That approval means Sarepta will move to the BBP portfolio when the two BioShares ETFs next rebalance in December.This ETF pair allows investors to decide ""how much to mix,"" in terms of combining more-risky with less-risky biotechs, said Paul Yook, founder of BioShares.BBP's focus on household names makes it a relatively less volatile fund. In contrast, BBC holds the riskiest biotechs — highflying companies whose shares could double or triple overnight, and may crash and burn just as well.Yook describes BBP and BBC as the only exchange traded funds to separate clinical-trial companies and product companies into two distinct and stand-alone investments.Investors don't seem much enamored with the idea of custom-tailoring risk. The funds are extremely small and thinly traded, nearly two years after their debut. They have, however, seen a combined $5.8 million in net inflow over the first three quarters of 2016.The BBP fund is the best performer among biotech ETFs so far this year, and BBC the worst.Meanwhile, bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) has given up 20.8% year to date and sits 21% below its December high.Biotechnology ETFs crumbled over the past year, coming under pressure from lackluster earnings as well as negative scrutiny for health care peers Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Mylan (MYL) in a politically charged season.Despite the ""wall of worry"" around this industry group, at least one analyst has a favorable outlook for biotechs after the Nov. 8 presidential elections.Yook points out another promising sign: a pickup in M&A, with mouthwatering sticker prices for target companies. Allergan (AGN) announced in September that it would acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for roughly $639 million — a 159% premium per share.Biotechs are attractively priced too. This is one rare corner of the stock market where valuations are cheaper than they have been historically, Yook told IBD in a phone interview.While many ETF investors are waiting to buy biotechnology stocks until after the November election, he believes the fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency is priced in.The Democratic presidential contender's remarks on drug price-gouging had triggered sharp biotech declines.Yook added: ""Most of the political scrutiny will be faced by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as Valeant, Mylan and Horizon (HZNP), which our BioShares funds avoid.

151,MYL,"U.S. stocks advanced moderately in late morning trade Monday as volume picked up.The Nasdaq added 0.3%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was ahead by 0.6%. Volume was running higher in the stock market today, although early volume figures can often change.EpiPen maker Mylan (MYL) initially rose about 3%, but reversed to trade modestly lower. The Netherlands-based company has attracted bad publicity because of price increases that have boosted a two-pack of the EpiPen device to a $600 list price. On Monday, the company announced that it would offer a generic version of its allergic-treatment product at half the current price.The flap has brought negative publicity to Mylan and more awareness of EpiPen's cheaper rivals. AdrenaClick, for example, offers a less expensive product, and some doctors have pointed out that a syringe and bottle of the non-patent epinephrine can be bought for about $10. EpiPen's patents are related to its delivery device.Meanwhile, blue chip stocks were mostly higher. On the Dow, financial stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose about 1%.Talk of an interest rate hike has been lifting bank stocks. Citizens Financial (CFG) advanced 2% in fast trade Monday, adding to Friday's breakout gain of 2%. Volume was routine Friday, but heavy in early trade Monday.

152,MYL,"Shares of generic drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO), which had fallen by about half in the past year, jumped Monday after activist hedge fund investor Starboard Value announced it had taken a 4.6% ownership stake and was asking for changes at the company.""We believe that Perrigo is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that should be within the control of management and the (board), Starboard wrote in a letter addressed to Perrigo CEO John Hendrickson. ""We believe changes are needed to reverse the trajectory of poor operating and financial performance and reposition Perrigo for future success.""We ... believe a significant opportunity exists to improve performance in Perrigo's core businesses.""Perrigo shares rose 7.35% to 95.23 in the stock market today, but they have been in a downtrend going back more than a year.IBD'S TAKE: While the generic-drug sector has been down, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group ranks a solid No. 16 out of 197 groups. Some of our recent coverage offered advice on what to look for in earnings reports, to spot sale volume growth vs. price-hike growth, and we identified three biotechs to keep an eye on this month.Perrigo elevated Hendrickson from president to CEO in April, after the company's former CEO Joseph Papa resigned to take the top job at Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX).Generic drugmakers have been under pressure from continued price competition. IBD's 19-company Medical-Generic Drugs group has fallen more than 20% this year.Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) on Friday gave an update on some of its products, including a competitor to the Mylan (MYL) EpiPen that it said could be on the market by late next year. The huge overall issue of high drug prices sprang up again last month as lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sharply criticized the $600 cost of the emergency allergy treatment.But in a research note late Sunday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky was unimpressed by both Teva's update and the outlook for the sector overall. Of Teva's update, he wrote in a research note that ""we do not think it was enough to assuage pre-existing investor concerns around the overall generic outlook or drive Street numbers higher. We continue to see TEVA as best positioned, but generic sector visibility is still a challenge.""In November, Perrigo shareholders, as recommended by Perrigo management, turned down a proposed buyout from Mylan valued at $205 a share. In its letter Monday, Starboard sharply criticized that move by Perrigo management.""Unfortunately, since that time, results have gone decidedly in the wrong direction, and management's promises have been woefully unfulfilled,"" Starboard wrote. ""Specifically, the company has severely mismanaged the Omega Pharma Invest (""Omega""; now Perrigo's Branded Consumer Healthcare business) integration, committed numerous execution errors, and significantly lowered financial guidance on the past two earnings calls.""Perrigo formed its branded consumer health care business, BCH, after acquiring Omega Pharma last year.

153,MYL,"Allergan (AGN) acquired a gene therapy for eye disease Tuesday, while its CEO separately criticized ""predatory"" drug pricing and pledged to limit his company's price increases.Allergan agreed to pay $60 million upfront to acquire RetroSense Therapeutics, along with unspecified future milestone payments tied to the success of RST-001, a gene therapy for the eye disease retinitis pigmentosa. While Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) has a gene therapy for the same disease in late-stage development, the two platforms take different approaches, noted Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat.""Spark's gene therapy is only aimed at one specific defect. … However, Retinitis Pigmentosa may be caused by a very heterogeneous set of mutations (encompassing 60+ genes),"" Raffat wrote in an email to clients. ""In simple words, Allergan's approach can (in theory) address this heterogeneous disease irrespective of the mutations causing it.""IBD'S TAKE: Spark Therapeutics stock has been hovering near a buy point since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base early last month. To learn more about bases, see IBD's How To Buy Stocks.Allergan stock rose 1.3% to 239.12 on the stock market today, but it's still down more than 20% for the year. Spark stock fell 1.9% to 57.11, but it's up more than 30% this year.Also Tuesday, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders wrote a blog post on drug pricing.""Lately, there has been a tremendous focus on the cost of medicines and some of it has been very appropriately targeted at those outliers who have taken dramatic price increases,"" he wrote without naming names, but no doubt referring to the political outcry over Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen over the last couple of weeks.Saunders went on to detail how he saw the ""social contract"" between drugmakers and the public, which he says such price increases violate. Among other things, he made a specific promise regarding Allergan's price increases:""Where we increase price on our branded therapeutic medicines, we will take price increases no more than once per year and, when we do, they will be limited to single-digit percentage increases.  Our expectation is that the overall cost of our drugs, net of rebates and discounts, will not increase by more than low-to-mid single digits percentages per year, slightly above the current annual rate of inflation.""Saunders also said Allergan would stop increasing prices if there was no corresponding increase in cost, a practice often taken as a drug nears its patent expiration and a practice that Allergan has taken in the past, he admitted.RELATED:Allergan Carves Middle Path in R&D Spending With 'Open Science'Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?
"
154,MYL,"Spending on health care services surged a greater-than-expected 6.9%, or $37.1 billion, from a year ago in the second quarter, according to Census Bureau data released Thursday. The acceleration in spending growth is a worrying sign after a period of moderating growth that followed an ObamaCare-fueled rise amid Medicaid and individual-market coverage expansions.The obvious concern is that the latest surge isn't tied to more people getting coverage, but to faster per-person cost growth.The Altarum Institute, which tracks health spending, had expected a 5.3% year-over-year rise in spending on health services, equal to the year-over-year growth in the first quarter and consistent with a gradually moderating trend.The surprising re-acceleration in spending, if sustained, could create more headaches for the health care sector, which has already felt rising political heat due to drug pricing and spiraling premiums for ObamaCare exchange coverage.Democrats are pushing a government insurance option competing alongside private insurers as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have pulled back from the non-group insurance market. Higher spending growth also could step up the pace at which the ObamaCare-created Independent Payment Advisory Board will have to propose cost cuts to restrain Medicare's growth. Meanwhile, both presidential candidates have talked about letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, and Hillary Clinton has been quick to capitalize on the drug-pricing controversy, leading criticism of Mylan (MYL) for its EpiPen price hike.Political risk in a hard-to-predict election year has helped make health care the worst-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors this year, with just a 1% gain, investment strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research noted earlier this week. ""The sector has been haunted by controversy over egregious drug pricing, insurers pulling out of ObamaCare, and some disappointing news on the new drug front,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Overall, health care has lagged other stock sectors this year, but there have been plenty of health-related winners, including Intuitive Surgical, Veeva Systems and Healthequity. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks — before they stage a breakout. IBD writes about the best investment candidates in features such as The New America  and includes them in lists such as the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders. IBD also will even help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.The 6.9% in spending on health care services reported in the Census' Quarterly Service Survey easily eclipsed the year-over-year growth reported since the recession — with one exception. The first quarter of 2015 saw 7.7% growth in health services spending, but that reflected the ObamaCare enrollment gains that, partly due to the HealthCare.gov technology glitch, didn't noticeably begin to push up health expenses until the second half of 2014. The services report doesn't detail prescription drug spending or health insurance spending.Hospital revenue jumped 6.6% from a year ago to $272 billion, even as the number of inpatient days dipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, hospital expenses on labor, supplies and overhead rose a more moderate 5.4%, signaling increased profitability. In this case, though, improvement is due to the tax-exempt sector. For-profit hospitals, such as those run by Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), actually saw expense growth (10.3%) outpace revenue growth (8.3%). Yet for-profit hospitals still have higher profit margins than the tax-exempt sector.Spending on ambulatory care services jumped 7.3% from a year ago to $244.3 billion. Within that category, outpatient care center spending rose 9.2% and home health care services 6.8%. Medical and diagnostic labs showed relatively slow 2.7% growth. Spending at nursing and residential care facilities rose 6.3%.Overall, spending on health care services accounted for about 26% of total growth in services spending. That makes six straight quarters in which health care has accounted for at least one-fourth of the total growth in year-over-year services spending — twice as big of a share of growth as that seen as recently as the second quarter of 2014.
"
155,MYL,"The sudden outbreak of political debate over Mylan's EpiPen in late August led to a grand circle of finger-pointing.Some members of Congress and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton blamed Mylan's (MYL) greed for the 400% price increase on its best-selling anaphylactic shock treatment treatment for severe allergic reactions.Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said various middlemen — insurers, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers — were taking so much of EpiPen's $608 list price that the company had to set it high to make money. That in turn led to a protest from the PBMs' chief lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA).""Blaming payers for these massive (price) hikes is a red herring and doesn't pass the laugh test with policymakers,"" the PCMA said in an Aug. 25 statement.IBD'S TAKE: Drugs have proven to be a tough investment this year due to the controversies surrounding them, the larger medical field is still a haven for investors seeking stability. Medical-related stocks account for seven of the IBD Big Cap 20 list of high-rated large caps. The organization fell short of blaming the government, but it did recommend that the FDA speed its approval process for off-patent drug products such as EpiPen which have no competition.Such drugs have sparked several price controversies over the last 12 months. Turing Pharmaceuticals' Daraprim and Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) Nitropress and Isuprel were both subject to triple- or quadruple-digit percentage hikes after they were acquired, which the companies could get away with because they had no competitors. Mylan eventually bowed to pressure and announced a generic version of EpiPen at half-price. Meantime, potential EpiPen competitors have run into a series of problems with the FDA.So, is the agency to blame? There just is no simple answer, experts say.Two bigger-picture facts tend to be ignored. One, generic-drug prices overall have been under pressure this year. The main reason is that the number of new drugs coming on the market has accelerated. Only unusual circumstances have enabled some drugs — like EpiPen — to have no rivals, and their owners thus to have a free hand at pricing.And two, FDA approvals overall have been speeding up, and new drugs being filed today have a notably greater success rate than they did a decade ago.Generic-drug approvals have lagged, however, and in some ways the generic-drug process is where new-drug approvals were 20 years ago.Mylan can keep its EpiPen prices propped up because its competitors keep hitting snags. The drug it contains, epinephrine, is easy enough to come by. But the pen itself, which delivers a precise dose of it, has been tricky to replicate.Impax Laboratories (IPXL) has a competing product available called Adrenaclick. But studies have shown that it takes more than one competitor to really drive down a drug price — four generics, in fact, is where the price war usually starts. (Adrenaclick retails for $500, though it varies somewhat by location.)Sanofi (SNY) had a competitor out called Auvi-Q, but it was recalled in October when some of the devices malfunctioned. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) has a device that failed its first attempt at FDA approval; the company expects to refile soon.""It's not purely a case here of the FDA not approving things quickly,"" said Craig Garthwaite, co-director of the Health Enterprise Management Program at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who is neither pro- nor anti-Mylan. ""If you think about what EpiPen does, it's in some ways quite amazing and in some ways quite simple. It gives a consistent dose every time for people with no training, for a lifesaving drug that can be used in many different situations.""Drugs like Daraprim, Nitropress and Isuprel, on the other hand, don't require any fancy equipment. What gives them their niche, says Garthwaite, is that their markets are tiny, with only a few thousand doses delivered per year. And here the expenses of development become prohibitive.""As a general rule, the smaller the market is, (and) the more regulations there are around whether people can enter, the harder it's going to be to get multiple entrants,"" he said. (EpiPen does not have this problem because its market is big.)Getting a drug approved has become more expensive due to the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) attached to the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.The GDUFA was modeled on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which was passed in 1992 due to AIDS activists' protests that new drug approvals took too long. Under this law, drug companies paid fees upon filing for drug approvals. The FDA used the fees to invest in things like hiring review staff to help the agency meet performance benchmarks in its improved review process. Later additions, like granting some proposed drugs Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations, also gave the FDA ways to hasten review of certain drugs.Over time, this helped streamline the process for new drug approvals, and also improve the success rate. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of new drugs approved per year jumped from 20 to 45, with 87% making it through on the first attempt last year vs. 70% a decade earlier.One lesson of the PDUFA experience, however, is that changing a big bureaucracy is slow. It took over a decade for that law to bear significant fruit.And meanwhile, the FDA still faces the problem that induced GDUFA to begin with: a huge backlog of generic-drug filings, known as abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs.""Part of the challenge is that ANDA submissions keep outpacing approvals, and based on activity through April of this year, (that) is looking likely again,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky in a research report in May. ""If we assumed that there were no more ANDA submissions (which is clearly not going to happen), even if the FDA doubled its monthly approval output to 150 ANDAs, it would still take over two years to work down the current backlog.""Nonetheless, the new approvals have been ticking up. Some 492 ANDAs were approved last year, vs. 404 the year before. And that's been enough to be felt by the big generic drugmakers: This year Endo International (ENDP), Teva and Mylan itself have all missed Wall Street's estimates on the generics side of their business, which they blamed on price erosion due to increased competition.Still, clearing the backlog wouldn't solve the problem of small-market generic drugs, since the GDUFA fees and other expenses can make entering the field more expensive than it's worth. Northwestern's Garthwaite favors not so much loosening the regulations as going around them in such special cases by importing drugs from other countries with approval systems the U.S. trusts, like those in the European Union. This already is done for drug shortages.This was also one of Clinton's proposals in a new plan, released Friday, for dealing with the issue. The plan didn't directly deal with the drug-approval process, but it did promise to ""fully fund the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs to clear out their multi­year generic-drug-approval backlog.""Drug approvals and pricing remain a big issue, with more discussion coming soon. At the same time that some members of Congress are asking Mylan for documents before a possible hearing, three members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce have asked the FDA to explain the problems of Mylan's competitors. The agency has until Sept. 9 to answer.RELATED:3 Biotech Stocks That Could Make Big Moves In September
"
156,MYL,"Embattled drug giant Mylan (MYL) said Monday that it will take the unusual step of launching a generic competitor to its own product, EpiPen, at half the price of the original.Mylan spent last week defending itself against criticism from the Senate and from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over its multiple price hikes for EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment. On Thursday, Mylan said it would expand patient assistance for EpiPen without actually lowering the price. But on Monday, it said that in the next few weeks it will release a generic version at $300 for a two-pack, compared with the current $608 price for the brand.""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response, which required the cooperation of our partner,"" said Mylan CEO Heather Bresch in a statement, presumably referring to Pfizer (PFE), which draws royalties on the product. ""However, because of the complexity and opaqueness of today's branded pharmaceutical supply chain and the increased shifting of costs to patients as a result of high-deductible health plans, we determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.""IBD'S TAKE: Mylan's misadventures show why relying on price increases for growth is a risky strategy. To find out how much other drugmakers are doing the same, check out our recent rundown of price vs. volume growth among big biotechs.Later on Monday, however, U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and ranking committee member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., sent a letter to Bresch asking for documentation relating to Mylan's income and profit from EpiPen, as well as its patient-assistance programs, government funding, arrangements with Pfizer and lobbying activities.Three Republican members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce also sent a letter to the FDA asking about the process for approving EpiPen's generic competitors, which has come under fire from some quarters because it's taking so long.Mylan also intends to bypass some of the system's complexities by launching a direct-ship program for EpiPen customers, potentially getting around some of the middlemen that Bresch said last week took cuts of most of EpiPen's list price.Normally when generic competition threatens, the drug developer makes a deal with a generic drugmaker to sell the exclusive ""authorized generic"" for the first six months before other competitors can come onto the market. However, since Mylan's main business is generic drugs, it can essentially be the generic partner to itself.EpiPen has been off patent for a while, and generic versions of the drug it contains, epinephrene, are already available. It's the injection device, which delivers a precise dose of the drug, that's proven tricky to replicate. Sanofi (SNY) had a competitor out called Auvi-Q that was recalled last October when some of the devices malfunctioned. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) has a device that failed its first attempt at FDA approval, though the company expects to re-file in the coming months.""We estimate Mylan's launch of an EpiPen authorized generic (AG) will have a 8-14% impact on our 2016-17 EpiPen sales estimates and a modest impact (2%) on our EPS forecasts,"" Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""Our estimated AG impact does not account for any reduction in SG&A (sales, general & administrative spending) commitments with EpiPen, which Mylan may look to initiate in order to mitigate the EPS downside.""Mylan initially rallied as much as 2.8% on the generic EpiPen news, but closed up 0.4% to 43.22 on the stock market today. Teva stock was down 1.55% to 50.75.

The EU said Apple (AAPL) must repay $14.5 billion in taxes and Mylan (MYL) buckled to pressure and offered a half-priced generic EpiPen. Salesforce (CRM) gave weak guidance, while United Airlines (UAL) hired a key American Airlines (AAL) executive.The major market averages rose modestly for the week, continuing the long string of sideways action near record highs. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.5%. Investors see a Fed rate hike in September as even less likely now. Fiber-optic stocks remained hot, generic drugs rebounded. Apparel stores were among the notable losers.The European Union's executive arm ordered Apple to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals.

Crude inventories rose for a second straight week, while mixed economic data also weighed. U.S. oil rig counts edged higher to a seven-month high.Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) launched a generic EpiPen on Monday, responding to a frenzy of criticism over price hikes on its allergy treatment. But it faced new lawmaker calls for EpiPen-related documents, while others asked the FDA for an explanation of what was holding up approval for other generic versions. On Friday, some lawmakers accused Mylan of overcharging Medicaid for EpiPen, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said she would crack down on drug-price hikes. Mylan fell 7.1% this week after tumbling 11.6% in the prior week.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earned 50 cents a share excluding items, meeting fiscal Q4 views for a 79% gain. Revenue growth topped. But EPS guidance for current Q1 was weak and indicated yet another quarter of decelerating Palo Alto growth from very high levels. Despite solid full-year EPS guidance and a $500 million buyback plan, shares fell 7.2% on Wednesday, but rallied for a 3.2% weekly gain, just below its 200-day line.Chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Ambarella (AMBA) late Thursday posted top- and bottom-line beats for quarters ended July 31, and both gave guidance that topped Wall Street … and both stocks fell Friday and for the week. One problem is that investors and analysts have some doubts about crucial products about to be announced by key customers.Ciena (CIEN), a major fiber-optic company, earned 42 cents a share excluding items in its fiscal Q3, up 13.5% and beating by four cents. Sales grew 11% to $670.6 million, slightly below views for $672.2 million. Ciena stock broke out of a consolidation, rising 5.8% for the week.

But billings were below expectations, with Q3 guidance that implied billings growth might tick down again. Salesforce, which said it sees some ""softness"" in U.S. demand, projects fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, vs. Wall Street consensus of $2.12 billion.

Teen-centric retailer Five Below (FIVE) gave weak third-quarter guidance. That followed murky forecasts from Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT)begins its own price-cutting campaign, potentially drawing customers away from rival discounters.Ollie's stock rose 4% for the week, retaking a 26.65 buy point after falling below its 50-day line. Five Below fell 6.5% as it extended its losing streak to eight straight sessions.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) met earnings estimates of 38 cents a share, marking 12% growth, but missed on revenue, as sales grew 14% to $514.5 million vs. forecasts for $515.5 million. Currency-neutral same-store sales rose 5% for the yogawear maker and retailer. Some analysts were anticipating an earnings turnaround, but Lululemon issued cautious Q3 guidance. Shares sank 10%, erasing virtually all of Lululemon's gains from its breakout after its prior earnings report.Shares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped this week after Scott Kirby joined the carrier from American Airlines (AAL), where he had served as president. Kirby, now United's president, is seen by some as one of the industry's best revenue strategists. The move rounds out United's recent efforts to shake up its executive team to compete with American and Delta Air Lines (DAL). United rose 9% for the week, retaking its 200-day line. American climbed 0.8%. Delta, which reported that August unit revenue fell 9.5% vs. a year earlier as it suffered outages that forced cancellations, rose 3%. Hawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaiian Airlines, rose 4.8%, breaking past a buy point, but in light volume.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) late Thursday reported first-quarter results that easily beat Wall Street forecasts. It raised full-year guidance, helped by new acquisitions. But shares of the gunmaker slid 6.4% on Friday to a two-month low and back below its 50-day line. That's in part due to FBI data on August background checks — a loose indicator of firearm demand — that didn't exhibit the surge seen in previous months. Shares of rival Sturm Ruger (RGR) fell 2.5% on Friday.Stun-gun maker Taser (TASR) broke out of short consolidation on Tuesday, then crashed to fall 6.8% for the week, diving through its 50-day line.Veeva Systems (VEEV) was expected to report a soft Q2 due to the lumpiness of its bookings, but Veeva earnings beat estimates, while 34% sales growth also surprised. Analysts credited strong uptake of the Vault content-management system.

159,MYL,"Shares of generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) rebounded in early trading Thursday, then lost steam, after the company said it would expand patient assistance for its controversially priced drug EpiPen.The move hit shares of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts (ESRX) and pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS).Mylan stock had been falling all week as members of Congress called for an investigation into its pricing of the emergency anti-allergy drug, which has gone up 400% in the last few years. On Wednesday, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also criticized the company and promised to act against high drug prices as president, statements that demolished the drug stock rally of the last few days.On Thursday, Mylan issued a press release saying it was doubling the eligibility of its patient-assistance program for EpiPen to 400% of the poverty level, meaning that a family of four making $97,200 a year would pay nothing for it. It also offered a savings card of up to $300 to defray out-of-pocket costs for those on frugal insurance plans.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan's troubles were foreseen by some in the industry, and it's not alone — see our June article These 6 Drugmakers Could Be The Next Price War Casualties.Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat roughly estimated that the new programs would have, at most, an annual $100 million impact on Mylan, or 10% of EpiPen sales. Earlier in the week he noted that there was evidence of heavy rebating already going on with EpiPen, which provides about 12% of Mylan's revenue.""Notice that in 2015, net sales increase vs. 2014 was roughly zero despite volumes up 7% and price up 31% year-over-year,"" Raffat wrote in an email to clients. ""This speaks to the contractual arrangements around EpiPen.""Mylan CEO Heather Bresch made a similar point in an interview with CNBC late Wednesday, saying that the middlemen that Mylan has to go through strip off large chunks of the price for themselves. Leerink analyst David Larsen wrote in a research note that this is likely why Express Scripts and CVS Health were both selling off Thursday.""This obviously implies that CVS and Express Scripts, as the PBMs, are reaping significant profits from EpiPen,"" Larsen wrote. Therefore, any reduction in EpiPen's price would presumably be felt by them as well, he said.Express Scripts stock fell 6% to 71.74 Thursday, hitting a 4-month low intraday. CVS stock was down 3.5% to 93.78.Larsen also noted that fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) has an EpiPen competitor that could hit the U.S. market in 2018.""Since a generic launch is pending, we believe Mylan may have been getting slightly more aggressive about pricing,"" he wrote.Mylan rose as much as 4.5% in early trading on the stock market today, after having lost more than 11% the previous three days. But the stock closed down 0.7% to 42.85.RELATED:AstraZeneca Sells Antibiotics Business; Mallinckrodt Sheds Imaging Unit

161,MYL,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%.

Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders.

Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million.

Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views.

162,MYL,"Drug stocks slipped Wednesday after rallying earlier in the day, as the politics of drug pricing resurfaced.The IBD Biotech/Biomedical group hit a seven-month high Wednesday morning, as the group continued the momentum started by Monday announcement of Pfizer's (PFE) deal to buy Medivation (MDVN). This raised hopes for more biotech M&A, which continued -- especially for Incyte (INCY) and BioMarin (BMRN), after Gabelli & Co. argued that they made especially attractive targets.Incyte rose more than 7% in early trading on the stock market today but ended the day up just a fraction, at 82.44. BioMarin initially gained almost 9% but then sharply reversed, ending down 4.3%, at 95.13.The proximate cause for the decline seemed to be presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticizing generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) for its pricing of allergy treatment EpiPen. While Mylan's multiple price hikes on EpiPen had already attracted discussion within the industry, this week the U.S. Senate got in on the act, demanding that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch explain EpiPen's high price. Clinton weighed in around midday Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: When the long-term outlook gets cloudy, look to IBD's Swing Trader for tips on short-term trading.As we noted this month, the biotech stock rally of the last eight weeks might have been driven partly by the fact that drug pricing had faded within the political debate. The group hit a seven-month high on Aug. 4, which it surpassed early Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a research note that drug pricing's comeback in politics could be with us for a while.""This is also a stark reminder that political scrutiny on pricing remains high across the sector and unlikely to dissipate anytime soon as we head toward the November election,"" Stanicky wrote.Nonetheless, for those familiar with IBD's chart-reading techniques, there are still leading biotechs that are worth keeping an eye on. Incyte has been bouncing around between the buy and sell zones since it popped out of a cup-with-handle base last month; its financials are also improving, as it's turned more consistently profitable over the last few quarters.Biogen (BIIB) also broke out of a cup-with handle at the start of this month and then blasted right past its buy point the next day on buyout rumors. Since then it's moved sideways, but Wednesday's reversal brought it close to the buy zone again, as it was down more than 3% near 308.Celgene (CELG) has been on the upslope of a consolidation that started in July of last year, and it still hasn't formed a specific buy point. Both Celgene and Biogen are strong stocks overall with Composite Ratings putting them in the top 6% of all stocks.The Generic Drugs group also has been rallying over the last eight weeks, though it's still low-ranked, going from No. 191 to No. 176 on IBD's list on 197 industry groups. The group was up again Wednesday after Lannett (LCI) beat Q4 expectations late Tuesday. Lannett stock jumped 14% Wednesday. Generic drugs, however, are the most direct target of the Senate inquiry. The group fell 2.6% Wednesday after earlier hitting a six-month high. Mylan stock fell 5.5% Wednesday after falling 4.8% Tuesday.RELATED:Hunting For Biotech Stocks?

163,MYL,"Stocks fell Wednesday as a sell-off in gold, silver and crude oil battered mining and energy shares. Generic-drug maker Mylan (MYL) fell sharply for a second day.The Nasdaq lost 0.8%, the S&P 500 fell 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.4%. Volume rose 8% on the Nasdaq and 4% on the S&P 500 compared with Tuesday, according to preliminary data.After the close, Workday (WDAY), a developer of cloud-based software for human resources applications, rose more than 3% after its quarterly earnings report.HP Inc. (HPQ) dropped more than 4% following its quarterly results after the close. The stock hit a new high intraday before reversing lower and ending down 1% during the regular session.In the stock market today, Mylan fell more than 5% in heavy volume amid mounting criticism over huge prices increases for allergy drug EpiPen. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on Mylan to drop the price of EpiPen, which has increased in price by 400% in the past decade. Clinton called the price hike ""outrageous.""Mylan is down 11% so far this week and has sliced through its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.Meanwhile, gold stocks fell as prices of the yellow metal sank 1% and Goldcorp (GG) plunged after Mexican regulators said they were investigating the Canadian miner over a leak of contaminated water at the country's biggest mine.Goldcorp dropped 9%, while Freeport McMoRan (FCX) sank more than 7%.Also Wednesday, oil prices dropped nearly 3% after an unexpected increase in U.S. inventories. Oil producer Denbury Resources (DNR) sank 5%.Burlington Stores (BURL), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) are among companies due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.Economic data due Thursday include new jobless claims for the week ended Aug. 20 and durable goods orders for July.

164,MYL,"Flagship ETFs tracking the major indexes closed lower Thursday ahead of a weekend conclave of policymakers in Wyoming.Investors remained on edge despite upbeat jobs data and an oil rally as they awaited a Friday speech from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen that may offer clues on the path of interest-rate hikes.Despite the restrained mood on the stock market today, a few asset classes scored a big advance.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) advanced 1.2% as it recovered from a 7% tumble the previous session that saw it fall solidly under the key 50-day moving average.The ETF invests in gold mining stocks, one of the year's best-performing industry groups.Biotech stocks surrendered an early rally.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) gave back gains of more than 1% to close down 1.1%. In Wednesday's session, remarks from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had triggered a steep 4.3% sell-off in this exchange traded fund. Clinton and some members of Congress questioned drugmaker Mylan (MYL) over the price of EpiPen, which has seen its price increase by 400% in the past decade. Clinton called the price hike ""outrageous.""Mylan responded on Thursday by expanding existing programs for patients who are facing higher out-of-pocket costs. The stock climbed nearly 2% intraday but ended in the red.A Clinton tweet back in September about price-gouging in the drug industry had triggered a 27%plunge in XBI in the span of a few trading sessions.IBD'S TAKE: Exchange traded funds offer investors exposure to a diversified basket of stocks, lowering portfolio risk. But it's always good to take a deeper dive into the best biotech stocks in your portfolio.Dave Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs, said political rhetoric ""shining a light on the drug industry in a possible negative way"" is fairly typical at this stage in an election cycle. He expects the primary driver of biotech stocks leading up to the November vote to be the political outlook rather than company-specific fundamentals.After the presidential elections, biotechs may benefit from a calmer environment and investors may find attractive valuations in this space in the interim, he told IBD in a phone call.XBI sits 25% off its 52-week high but has gained 12.9% in the third quarter through Aug. 24.As recently as Aug. 4, the biotech/biomedical group hit a multimonth high and was holding near that level following Monday's announcement of Pfizer's (PFE) deal to buy Medivation (MDVN).Here's how major exchange traded funds across major asset classes performed today, with IBD Relative Price Strength Ratings.The RS Rating is a measure of a stock's price performance over the last 12 months, compared with all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.1%, RS 51PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -0.2%, RS 59SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.2%, RS 51IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.2%, RS 63IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +0.2%, RS 63IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.4%, RS 31Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), 0%, RS 73SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.1%, RS 71United States Oil (USO), +1.2%, RS 18IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.1%, RS 37PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), 0%, RS 23IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +0.1%, RS 1RELATED:Is Gold ETF Rally Over?

"
165,MYL,"As usual, the specialty and generic drugmakers come to the fore as the earnings season nears its end, with several interesting stocks on deck.Allergan (AGN), reporting early Monday, has somewhat complicated financials since it just sold its huge generics business to Teva (TEVA) and had been counting that as a discontinued operation during the deal's lengthy approval process.Excluding that, the consensus sales estimate of $4.1 billion is flat vs. the year-earlier quarter, and the EPS estimate of $3.34 a share is up modestly, according to Leerink.IBD'S TAKE: Any outfit looking to acquire Biogen would have to pay a pretty price. Biogen itself, boosted by buyout rumors, is in the latest IBD Big Cap 20, a screen of companies that can deliver big gains but that have less volatility that smaller stocks.The Teva deal, which closed Aug. 2, leaves Allergan with a fat wad of cash to fuel buyout speculation. Already an anonymously sourced report had the company exploring an acquisition of Biogen (BIIB).Allergan stock traded mostly flat this week, closing Friday up a fraction at 253.85.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is looking at a shrinking quarter when it reports early Tuesday, continuing its recent woes from pricing pressure. Profit is seen falling 42% to $1.48 a share, with sales dropping 9.8% to $2.46 billion.The company accepted broad price cuts in its partnership this year with Walgreens (WBA), though the stock rose on July 6 when Walgreens made positive comments about the deal in its own earnings report.Valeant is starting to launch an oral version of constipation drug Relistor and is nearing the possible launch of psoriasis drug brodalumab, both of which have their skeptics on Wall Street.Valeant stock, down more than 90% from its 52-week high, closed the week a fraction lower at 21.96.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), reporting after the close Tuesday, is still on the growth train, with sales expected to climb 12.8% to $376 million, with profit up 16% to $2.80 a share.Jazz's stock is still elevated after it rose nearly 8% on July 28, when the patent board rejected a competitor's request to review a patent on Jazz's lead drug Xyrem, which has been subject to increasing patent challenges as it ages.Overall shares are down about 20% from their high, however, ending the week down a fraction at 150.66.Also late Tuesday, generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) is expected to record 8% sales growth to $2.57 billion, with profit gaining 24% to $1.13 a share.The company launched 12 new generic drugs in Q2 alone, but pricing pressure on the space has been an issue over the last few quarters.Mylan closed its $7.2 billion buyout of Swedish rival Meda on Friday. The deal was not hugely popular with investors when it was announced in February, which -- combined with an earnings miss -- drove the stock down 18%, but it's recovered somewhat since then.On Friday, Mylan stock closed up 1.7% for the week, at 48.46.
"
166,MYL,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings. So do mobile gaming portal NetEase (NTES) and flash e-commerce seller Vipshop (VIPS).IBD'S TAKE: With the market at record highs, many growth names large and small are breaking out. To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

168,MYL,"Drug pricing was on Wall Street's mind again Friday, as Wells Fargo tapped Mylan (MYL) as the next target for activists, while RBC considered the impact of a potential new law limiting prices in California.Wells Fargo analyst David Maris wrote that after Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Turing Pharmaceuticals were hauled in front of Congress and scrutinized by the press for their policies of drastically hiking the prices of recently acquired drugs, he's been keeping an eye out for other companies in his universe that have been doing a lot of price increases.""In the last six months, Mylan has raised prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,"" Maris wrote in his research note late Thursday. ""Mylan has taken some exceptionally large price increases in 2016, including a 542% increase for ursodiol, a generic medication used to treat gallstones; a 444% increase in metoclopramide, a generic medication commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroparesis; and a 400% increase in dicyclomine, a medication used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.""Maris added that last month Mylan added 15% to the price tag of its biggest product, which contributed 11% of revenue in the most recent quarter. ""We believe that given the regulatory environment, these pricing actions could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk. Additionally, we wonder if aggressive price increases are being used to make EPS targets or to offset disappointing sales in other areas.""Mylan responded with the following statement:""Mylan has always been known to have one of the industry's broadest and most globally diversified business models and portfolios, which we have successfully managed by balancing numerous variables, including the natural price reductions that have always been inherent to the generics industry. A flawed analysis focusing on a small number of products out of the more than 1,400 products Mylan sells globally and the approx. 600 products we sell in North America is simply self-serving and misleading to investors. This is especially true given that these generic products represent an extremely small percentage of Mylan's approx. $4 billion North American generics business. Mylan's business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes.""Mylan stock fell 2.7% to 44.53 on the stock market today after falling as low as 43. Valeant retreated 5.3% Friday and 16.4% for the week.RBC Capital Markets biotech analyst Michael Yee was also pondering drug pricing Friday as he calculated the potential impact of the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA) on the stocks in his universe, which include Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).The CDPRA, which goes up for popular vote under California's proposition system this November, would require state health care payers like MediCal to buy drugs at similar prices to the Veterans Administration, which usually obtains large discounts.""We believe CDPRA creates a slippery slope: The measure would encourage other states to follow suit (e.g. Ohio has also proposed it and is getting signatures),"" Yee wrote. ""But we think such attempts to reduce drug costs would merely prompt drug makers to just raise VA drug prices, thus helping less people and not resulting in any real savings benefits.""Nonetheless, Yee estimated that if similar laws passed in all 50 states, it could shave 2% to 3% off the annual EPS of his covered companies. ""Our discussions with large-cap biotech companies suggest firms are aware and wouldn't be surprised if the proposal passed, so we note investors should at the very least be informed of the potential headline and model pricing risks,"" he wrote.Drug stocks were down Friday along with the rest of the market. Amgen fell 1.3%, Gilead 1.5%, Biogen 1.7% and Celgene 3%, and Vertex Pharma dipped 1.1%.

173,MYL,"April auto sales released Tuesday could be a catalyst for General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), while earnings from Pfizer (PFE), Mylan (MYL) and CVS (CVS) are also at the top of the list of what you need to watch.GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all missed analyst estimates for sales in March amid expert projections for industry sales to level off after several years of booming growth. Edmunds.com expects the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of sales to reach 17.5 million in April -- that's down 4.8% from March but up 4.3% from last April. A J.D. Power and LMC Automotive joint forecast sees sales at a SAAR of 17.6 million for the month.GM has shaped a cup-with-handle base with a 33.51 buy point as it finds support at the 200-day line. It's currently trading 5% below the buy point at 13% below its 52-week high as it dipped a fraction Monday.Ford is 14% below its 52-week high. Shares are trying to find support around their downward-sloping 200-day line. Ford added 0.4% in intraday trade.Fiat Chrysler is trading above its 50-day line, but below its 200-day line. Shares are 24% below their 52-week high, and up 2.1% Monday.Drug giants Pfizer and Mylan both issue their quarterly reports on Tuesday morning. Pfizer’s earnings are projected to rise 8% to 55 cents a share while revenue increases 10% to $12 billion.Pfizer scrapped its $160 billion inversion buyout plan with Allergan (AGN) last month after the Treasury Department issued new rules to curb the tax-beneficial deals.Pfizer was able to retake its 200-day line in early April, and ended a five-session losing streak Monday as it added 0.3%. Shares are trading 10% below their 52-week high.Meanwhile, Mylan is expected to see earnings rise 6% to 74 cents a share on a 19% gain in revenue to $2.23 billion. Last quarter, Mylan missed expectations and the stock crumbled. The company also announced it was buying Sweden’s Meda for $9.9 billion.Mylan breached its 50-day line last week and snapped six straight sessions of declines Monday. The stock is trading 42% below its 52-week peak and climbed 2.4% Monday.The drugstore chain is expected to see earnings rise 2% to $1.16 a share when it reports Tuesday morning.

175,MYL,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) agreed to buy St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal that values the maker of heart devices at $25 billion, making its biggest ever acquisition as the industry consolidates to gain bargaining power with hospitals.St. Jude Medical shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 share of Abbott common stock, representing a total of approximately $85 per share, according to a statement Thursday.Medical devices makers are merging to get access to new technology as hospitals push for lower prices. St. Jude last year acquired Thoratec for $3.4 billion, adding left ventricular pump devices that take over for a failing heart.The combined Abbott-St. Jude medical company will have a pipeline of new medical device products across cardiovascular, diabetes, vision and neuromodulation patient care, according to the statement.Abbott said in the statement it has financing for both St. Jude Medical and for its planned acquisition of Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, sending Alere shares higher in early trading on the stock market today. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White declined to reiterate his commitment to the Alere deal last week on the company’s earnings call. Alere hasn’t yet filed its 10-K report with U.S. regulators and has been subpoenaed by the Justice Department.St. Jude Medical closed Wednesday at $61.95, giving the company a market value of about $17.6 billion. The stock jumped to $78.66 before the markets opened in New York. Abbott dropped 5 percent to $41.65 in early trading, while Alere rose 3.5 percent to $44.35.The acquisition will further reshape Abbott, which split off its brand name pharmaceutical business to AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013.

177,MYL,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) rose sharply and fellow specialty drugmaker Perrigo’s (PRGO) fell Friday on reports that the former is about to hire away the latter's CEO.Late Thursday, the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources saying that Valeant is hiring Joseph Papa if it can get Perrigo's board to void a noncompete clause in his contract. On Friday morning, Perrigo issued a brief statement saying that it would not comment on ""speculation,"" which is the only official word from either company so far.Valeant has been hunting for a new CEO since March 21, when activist investor William Ackman moved to the board and tried to order the company's growing chaos. The stock lost more than 80% of its value since a scandal related to a pharmacy partner broke last September, forcing Valeant to strike a new distribution deal with Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA) that was accompanied by across-the-board price cuts. A disastrous Q4 report and guidance cut, along with an internal investigation that accused former CFO and current board member Howard Schiller of misconduct, eventually turned even bullish analysts against Valeant's management.Papa, meanwhile, has run Perrigo for 10 years and has a largely successful track record. Under his watch, the company's revenue has more than tripled, the stock has climbed eightfold, an inversion deal moved headquarters to low-tax Dublin, and Mylan (MYL) attempted a hostile takeover that Perrigo successfully fought off.IBD Take: Perrigo was once a hot stock, but not lately. Learn why in IBD Stock CheckupPerrigo's once-steady profit growth has gotten uneven in the last couple of years, however, and the stock has declined more than 40% since its Mylan-induced high last April. It currently holds a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 40.This change has led some analysts to worry about the implications of Papa's departure for Perrigo.""Papa has become the face of Perrigo during his long tenure as CEO,"" wrote Jefferies analyst David Steinberg in a research note. ""However, with the exception of CFO Judy Brown, the company’s other executives -- including John Hendrickson, who was appointed President in Oct. 2015 -- are largely unfamiliar to the investment community.""Further, the timing couldn’t have been more inopportune. Mr. Papa is potentially departing prior to the announcement of Q1 results, and this follows a string of difficult quarterly financials -- particularly in the company’s flagship consumer business.""Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen agreed, noting that Perrigo is widely expected to miss Q1 estimates and lower its guidance. ""There has been debate about senior management change at Perrigo, but we don't think the Street was thinking that it would actually happen or be this soon,"" Chen wrote.Perrigo stock was down 5.8% in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 121, after hitting its lowest level intraday since August 2013. Valeant stock was up 7.7%, near 36.

That beat analysts' consensus of 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. On a GAAP basis, Sucampo made 23 cents a share. Sales climbed 47% to $55.4 million, about $13 million above consensus.For the full year, Sucampo made 95 cents a share, up 136% from 2014, while revenue rose 33% to $153.2 million. For the current year, the company affirmed its previous guidance of 97 cents to $1.07 in EPS on sales of $195 million to $205 million.Sucampo stock jumped almost 15% in early trading to 16, its highest point since Jan. 5, but closed up just 4.3% at 14.54.The company's lead drug Amitiza provided most of the revenue, with prescriptions growing 10% over Q4 2014 to 390,228. Sucampo's income derives from royalties paid by its partners, Takeda in the U.S. and Mylan (MYL) in Japan; Sucampo also took a $5 million milestone payment from Mylan in the quarter as part of their partnership.The Q4 results included the acquisition of R-Tech Ueno in December, which gave Sucampo a greater share in Amitiza's global economics as well as some pipeline products.""The key revenue driver, Amitiza, is doing better than we expected outside the U.S., and even in the U.S. sales remained strong as the end-market sales reported by Takeda for royalty calculation were $102.3 million vs. our estimate of $98.2 million,"" wrote UBS analyst Ami Fadia in a research note. ""4Q 2015 was the first reported quarter that included the R-Tech deal and we are starting to see the improvement in earnings we were expecting from this deal.""Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen lowered her 2016 earnings estimate slightly due to the guidance, but said several factors could provide upside this year: M&A, data readouts on some pipeline products this year, and new formulations and indications for Amitiza, which is currently used for constipation. She estimated that Sucampo has the financial capacity to make a buyout in the $400 million to $500 million range.

180,MYL,"Allergan (AGN) stock dived Tuesday after the U.S. Treasury and IRS announced plans for new rules aimed at curbing tax inversions, a practice that allows U.S. companies to avoid taxes by buying a foreign company and moving their headquarters overseas.That could impact the pending deal between Pfizer (PFE) and Ireland-based Allergan -- set to close this year -- since the latter is the result of several recent inversions.The companies said in a statement late Monday: ""We are conducting a review of the U.S. Department of Treasury’s actions announced today. Prior to completing the review, we won’t speculate on any potential impact.""Allergan fell nearly 20% to 233 in premarket trading, which would be the lowest level since October 2014. Pfizer rose nearly 2%.The latest Treasury  actions would limit the ability of inverted companies to lend money to their American subsidiaries, which creates deductible interest and reduces their taxable income in the U.S., by treating certain debt issuance as stock.""Serial inverters,"" are also targeted. Under the new rules, there's a three-year limit on foreign companies ""bulking up"" on U.S. assets to avoid ownership requirements for a later inversion deal.This is the third set of inversion-curbing rules issued by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew in the last few years. Lew said his office is continuing to explore additional ways to limit inversions.America's corporate tax system gives companies a strong incentive to shift headquarters overseas. The combined federal-state corporate rate is 39%, the highest in the industrialized world, while America -- unlike most nations -- taxes overseas earnings. Inverted companies still have to pay U.S. tax rates on American profits, but are get relief on earnings elsewhere.Other notable recent inversions involved Mylan (MYL), Medtronic (MDT) and Burger King, now called Restaurant Brands (QSR). But those deals have already closed.

182,MYL,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Perrigo (PRGO) shares continued to tumble Monday, generally pulling the drug sector down with them. Allergan (AGN) was an exception, rising on strong earnings.Valeant late Monday tumbled as low as 68 -- which would be the lowest since March 2013 -- on a Dow Jones report that Valeant Pharmaceuticals would likely restate earnings. Hours later Valeant said a restatement for 2014 and 2015 earnings is expected, related to sales of drugs to ex-distributor Philidor. Valeant said $58 million in sales in late 2014 should have been recognized later. Valeant expects 2014 earnings to be lowered by 10 cents a share, with 2015 EPS lifted by 9 cents.During the regular session, Valeant shares closed down 10.7% at 75.92  in the stock market today, extending losses on a bearish report from Wells Fargo Friday. Valeant shares dived nearly 10% that day after Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the maker of branded drugs to treat eye diseases, acne, depression and other ailments with an underperform, saying there were ""unanswered questions"" about its accounting methods and strategic direction.Earlier Monday, drugstore giant CVS Health (CVS) said it plans to restrict use of Valeant's Jublia toenail fungus drug as part of an initiative to cut costs for dermatology treatments. Jublia retails at about $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle, according to the website GoodRx.Valeant stock price has plunged 69% from a Sept. 21 intraday high at 245.82 despite double-digit quarterly earnings and revenue growth for nearly four years. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund is down significantly this year partly because of the fund's large stake in Valeant.Valeant had already been battered by a series of events including the absence of CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications. On Jan. 6, Valeant's board named board member and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller A interim CEO.Earlier this month, Valeant interim CEO Schiller was called before Congress to explain why the company decided to increase the prices of two cardiac drugs by 525% and 212%. Schiller promised to end an era of sharp price hikes.Perrigo, whose business model is divided between private-label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugs, fell 4.1% to 124.08 Monday to its lowest level since late 2013.The stock has lost 15% over three sessions, after Perrigo reported weak fourth quarter results on Thursday and subsequently had negative reports by Jefferies on Friday and by Goldman Sachs on Monday.Jefferies cut its price target to 163 from 209 although it maintained a buy rating. Goldman Sachs, however, downgraded the stock from neutral to sell, with a 124 price target, reports said.Perrigo reported $1.80 Q4 EPS minus one-time items, 13 cents below estimates. It was the company's first earnings miss in five quarters. Revenue grew 33% to $1.425 billion. Analysts expected $1.461 billion.Mylan (MYL) last year made an offer for Perrigo, which Perrigo shareholders in mid-November rejected. Mylan rose 3.2% Monday.Big pharma Allergan (AGN) reported what it expects to be its final full earnings report as an independent drug maker after it agreed in November to be bought by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion.Allergan's Q4 EPS ex items rose 33% to $3.41 on a 74% hike in revenue to $4.2 billion. Wall Street expected $3.34 EPS and $4.19 billion revenue.Allergan shares climbed 3.7% to 285.82.

201,MYL,"Pfizer (PFE) is near a massive deal to buy Allergan (AGN) and redomicile in Ireland, multiple reports said, even as the Treasury Department plans to impose new restrictions on tax inversions.Pfizer are discussing a deal that would pay $370-$380 a share for Botox maker Allergan, Bloomberg and Reuters reported late Wednesday. Allergan rose 4.5% to 310.83 on Wednesday, but retreated after hours following news of the inversion rules. Allergan traded as low as 237.50 on Oct. 21 before Pfizer-Allergan deal buzz picked up. Pfizer rose 1.3% to 33.31 on Wednesday, and was little changed late Wednesday.At $380 a share, it would be a $150 billion takeover, the largest health care deal ever and the biggest takeover of any kind this year.Bloomberg said the companies want to announce a deal as soon as Monday while Reuters said an announcement was not necessarily imminent. Both said that the Treasury's Wednesday announcement to issue ""targeted"" tax inversion guidance later this week could affect the timing of any agreement.By acquiring the Irish drugmaker, Pfizer would be able to limit its exposure to the punitive U.S. corporate tax system. America's corporate rates are the highest in the industrial world and the country taxes U.S. companies' overseas profits when they are repatriated.The Treasury issues restrictions on tax inversions in September 2014.

Further details were unavailable.""It is important to emphasize, however, that Treasury cannot stop inversions without new statutory authority,"" Lew said. ""Unless and until Congress acts, creative accountants and lawyers will continue to find new ways for companies to move their tax residences overseas and avoid paying taxes here at home.""Shares of Allergan (AGN), an Ireland-based drugmaker, had been mulling an inversion deal with Pfizer (PFE). Pfizer was little changed after hours. Allergan fell 4.2% to 297.98 in late trade,nearly wiping out the regular-session gain of 4.5% to 310.80. Allergan is still up sharply from its late-October levels when the Pfizer buzz began.The Treasury Department first began attempting to crack down on tax inversions in September 2014 following a series of inversion attempts, particularly in the pharmaceutical business. Those rules stopped an AbbVie (ABBV) acquisition, but deals involving Burger King (now Restaurant Brands (QSR), Medtronic (MDT) and Mylan (MYL) went ahead.Under a tax inversion, the company seeking to move is technically the one being acquired, although in practice the relocating company would run the combined business.Many say the deals deplete U.S. tax revenue and allow companies with much of their operations in the U.S. to dodge taxes. But many in the business community say inversions wouldn't be needed if the U.S. corporate tax rate was lower. The U.S. has the world's highest tax rate in the industrial world and taxes overseas profits when they are repatriated here.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

"
266,MYL,"To be sold or not to be sold? That is, of course, the question that lies before generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO). But regardless of the answer, analysts say there is plenty of reason for investors to take interest in the Dublin-based company, owing to its ability to capitalize on trends in generic prescription drugs and over-the-counter sales.First things first: On Friday, stockholders of drugmaker Mylan (MYL) are scheduled to vote on whether to approve a $30-billion-plus hostile takeover bid for Perrigo and move ahead with a tender offer. Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa, speaking this month with analysts during the company's latest quarterly earnings call, reiterated his own opposition to the offer and the unanimous rejection by Perrigo's board.""I make no prediction on how the Mylan shareholders will vote, but I want to remind everyone, including the Mylan shareholders, that if they proceed with a tender offer for Perrigo, this will not be the easy path that some are painting it to be,"" Papa said, expressing confidence that Perrigo investors support his stand-alone ambitions.Mylan began pursuing Perrigo earlier this year. Following several refusals, Mylan recently offered $75 a share in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share. Mylan needs both the approval of its own shareholders and support from 50% of Perrigo's investors, plus one more share to seal a deal.If Mylan Insists, A New DecisionIn letters to shareholders, public statements and his most recent earnings call, Papa has said that Mylan has undervalued Perrigo. ""If Mylan does win their shareholder vote and initiate a tender process, we'll make a strategic decision with the board about what's the right thing to do for the company,"" he said.Expecting a close vote, analysts and observers say that, whether a deal ever gets done or not, the M&A talk surrounding Perrigo has attracted some positive attention. ""We are sticking with our buy rating on Perrigo as we see paths to upside in the shares either on a stand-alone basis (hopefully supplemented by acquisitions) or in a large-scale M&A context (e.g., sale to Mylan or another party),"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.Perhaps deal talks will lead to an even stronger bid from Mylan or another suitor — a potential win for investors. Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a veteran health care industry investor, told IBD that many pharma companies are hunting acquisitions, so it would not surprise him if more buyers show serious interest in Perrigo. ""It's about building up the pipelines,"" he said. ""And M&A can be an efficient way to do that.""On the other hand, if Mylan's takeover attempt falters and other suitors do not immediately enter the fray, Perrigo would be freed from a months-long distraction and could focus anew on both organic growth and acquisitions of its own.Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business and a long-time observer of M&A markets, told IBD that in the pharma industry, bigger players often can capitalize on their scale to more efficiently distribute the medications manufactured by a takeout target.But that is not always the case, he added, saying that some fast-growth companies have such robust pipelines and proven growth that a sale may simply interfere with already solid expansion paths. If Perrigo can establish that it is indeed the case, and if its own shareholders back it via a vote against a Mylan takeover, it could add an important dose of confidence for investors to feed upon.Biggest Isn't Always Best""There are a lot of moving parts to address when it comes to distributing pharmaceuticals, and that tends to favor the larger companies,"" White said. ""But it is not like there is a 'biggest is always best' rule here.""Analysts say that Perrigo is indeed well-positioned for growth should it remain a stand-alone entity. The company is a leading maker and distributor of private-label over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs, and analysts say that frugal consumers are increasingly moving away from national brands to store brands and away from expensive prescriptions to OTC alternatives. ""M&A outcomes aside, we continue to like the fundamental Perrigo story, given its global leadership position in store-brand OTC and ability to capitalize on (the) Rx-to-OTC switch,"" William Blair analysts said in an August report.Perrigo, which spent 2014 absorbing its own acquisition of Dublin-based Elan, sells treatments for everything from smoking cessation to pain relief. Its stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 in IBD's Medical-General Drugs industry group, which itself ranks 31st out of 197 industry groups. Perrigo is ranked No. 2 behind Allergan (AGN).For the quarter that ended in June, Perrigo reported earnings of $56.4 million, or 38 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it generated EPS of $2.18, up 25%, on revenue up 34% to $1.53 billion. The firm cited strength in its new branded consumer health care line, which includes its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, and expansion of pharmaceuticals revenue. Branded consumer health care generated sales of $401 million, while sales in Perrigo's prescription-pharmaceuticals segment increased 10% to $278 million.More Bolt-Ons ExpectedThe company also recently inked deals to buy Patheon's operations in Mexico, as well as a portfolio of OTC drugs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Analysts anticipate that Perrigo will pursue more such bolt-on deals should it remain a stand-alone operation.After posting the quarterly results earlier in August, Perrigo executives projected 2015 EPS of $7.50 to $8, a 24% increase at the midpoint, on sales of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion, ahead 33% at the midpoint.Executives say that, in addition to company-specific trends, Perrigo also stands to benefit from general and ongoing demographic and health care developments.""Given the megatrends that I have talked about for many years, including an aging population, increased use of medication as individuals get older and rising health care costs, Perrigo is well-positioned to meet the future needs for the global health care community,"" Papa, the chief executive, said on the earnings call.

268,MYL,"Specialty drugmaker Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) beat Q2 expectations and raised its guidance early Wednesday, sending the stock to a new high in early trading. It pulled back later, however, possibly because word got out that its sole marketed drug is being excluded from CVS' (CVS) preferred formulary next year.Sucampo reported earnings of 21 cents a share, up from just 4 cents in the year-earlier quarter and 6 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 45% to $34.9 million, about $3 million more than analysts expected.The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to 65-75 cents, topping the Street's estimate of 62 cents.Sucampo's revenue all comes from constipation drug Amitiza, which is still growing even though it's been on the market for nine years. In the U.S., prescriptions grew 10%, while Sucampo's royalty revenue through its marketing partner Takeda grew 15%. In Japan, royalty revenue from marketing partner Mylan (MYL) doubled.""In the second quarter, we delivered outstanding earnings growth, driven mainly by Amitiza's continued growth in the U.S. and Japan,"" Sucampo CEO Peter Greenleaf said in a statement. ""Our financial strength will fuel the continued transformation of our business.""That transformation includes the launch of a second drug, cobiprostone, which is in midstage testing for oral mucositis. Many on the Street have been waiting for Sucampo to acquire a company or drug to help fill out its thin pipeline. Greenleaf has told IBD that he's actively looking for opportunities, but for now the company still depends on the one product.That became a greater issue when pharmacy giant CVS' 2016 preferred formulary list leaked online, and Amitiza wasn't on it. It had been on this year's formulary, but CVS knocked it off in favor of Allergan's (AGN) Linzess.Nonetheless, Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen raised her price target on Sucampo to 27 from 23 and affirmed her buy rating.""Sucampo still expects mid-to-high single-digit growth for Amitiza despite Amitiza being put on CVS exclusion list; Amitiza has also had some formulary wins and the negotiations on reimbursement are still ongoing,"" Chen wrote in a research note Wednesday.Sucampo stock has been volatile since emerging from a cup base in mid-July, and the volatility continued on the stock market today. Shares shot up 19% to a new high of 25.70 early, then reversed to fall as low as 20.02. The stock is up 0.7% to 21.73 at midday. The stock boasts a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning Sucampo tops 99% of all other stocks based on a range of key fundamental and technical factors.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

319,MYL,"Eagle Pharmaceuticals has soared to new heights on Wall Street after signing a key licensing pact that enhances the company's prospects to hit the market soon with a big money-making drug.Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) stock has leapt 207% since Feb. 17, when the company announced that it had inked an exclusive license agreement with Cephalon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Israeli drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), for Eagle's bendamustine hydrochloride (HCl) rapid-infusion product. It treats patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).What's In The Teva DealTeva will be responsible for all of the product's U.S. commercial activities, including promotion and distribution. Eagle is responsible for obtaining all regulatory approvals, conducting post-approval clinical studies, if required, and initially supplying the drug product to Teva.Under terms of the pact, Eagle received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, which was recognized as income, and is eligible to receive up to $90 million in additional milestone payments.Besides the milestone payments, Eagle says it will get ""double-digit"" (percentage) royalties on the net sales of the product, assuming Food and Drug Administration approval.""The draw for investors is Eagle has a very credible partner in Teva, and it has the ability to deliver over $100 million in royalties in 2016,"" William Blair analyst Tim Lugo told IBD.Lugo estimates the royalty payments Eagle will get from Teva to start at 20% of the product's sales.Eagle is focused on developing and commercializing injectable drug products, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, that improve on existing drugs.""We go out and speak to stakeholders like physicians, nurses and doctors, and find out where the gaps are in products and what needs to be improved,"" CEO and founder Scott Tarriff told IBD. ""We reformulate the drugs, and hopefully we bring drugs to the market our customers are asking for, and hopefully we're improving patients' outcomes.""Drug Introduction StrategyEagle's strategy is to introduce its products no later than the first generic competitor of the branded reference product, says a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Eagle's bendamustine rapid-infusion product is an improved formulation of Teva's bendamustine HCl product, Treanda.""We expect that Teva will convert nearly all the (Treanda) products in the market to our Eagle formulation,"" Tarriff said.How is Eagle's product better than Treanda? Eagle's product can be administered in approximately 10 minutes in a low-volume, 50-milliliter admixture vs. Treanda's 500-milliliter admixture, which requires an infusion that lasts 30 to 60 minutes, Tarriff says.Among the benefits of Eagle's product is less ""chair time"" for the patient and less nursing time required, Tarriff adds.The FDA accepted a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing with a Dec. 13, 2015, expected decision date on whether to approve the rapid-infusion bendamustine product to treat patients with CLL and patients with indolent B-cell NHL that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.Eagle uses the FDA's NDA regulatory pathway Section 505(b)(2), which ""expressly permits the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant such as published literature or the agency's finding of safety and/or effectiveness of a previously approved drug product,"" according to the FDA website.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted a new patent pertaining to the rapid-infusion bendamustine product, Eagle announced last month. The patent expires in March 2033.The product has received orphan drug designations for both CLL and indolent B-cell NHL, and therefore may be eligible for seven years of exclusivity upon approval, Eagle said in a press release.Tarriff estimates that the U.S. market for Treanda is $750 million.Tarriff says that since its founding in 2007, Eagle has been developing drugs. That has changed with the agreement with Teva, which Tarriff calls a ""big breakthrough.""""We are transitioning from a development company to a commercial company,"" said Tarriff. ""Teva will use (Eagle's bendamustine rapid-infusion product) as their own life cycle for their product.""Using A Capital InfusionLugo says that the agreement with Teva is a ""game changer"" for Eagle.""The company should have significant royalties, starting in 2016,"" he said. ""The question on the Street is: How is the company going to deploy that capital?""Eagle, which went public in February 2014, turned its first profit in 2015's first quarter. The company earned $1.31 a share vs. a loss of 36 cents a year earlier. Revenue jumped 625% to $36.3 million.Lugo says that the $30 million upfront cash payment from Teva drove Eagle's profit.However, he adds, ""the profit won't be sustainable"" until the company gains FDA approval for its bendamustine rapid-infusion product. The approval should come in the 2015 fourth quarter and drive profitability in 2016, Lugo says.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to show full-year 2015 earnings of 75 cents a share. They expect 2016 earnings to increase 653% and see a 9% rise in 2017.Eagle's Treatment PortfolioEagle has a portfolio of six drugs. It has three drugs on the market, one of which — Ryanodex, for injectable suspension to treat a rare, life-threatening condition called malignant hyperthermia — the FDA approved last summer.The FDA designated Ryanodex an orphan drug for malignant hyperthermia in 2013. The FDA has granted seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. to Ryanodex for treating this condition, Eagle announced in February.First quarter Ryanodex sales of $1.6 million were $1 million higher than the prior quarter, ""which reflects the successful execution of the product launch last fall and the ongoing efforts of our sales force,"" said Tarriff in a press release.Eagle is researching the potential for Ryanodex to be applied to exertional heat stroke.Eagle also has filed three NDAs with the FDA for other drugs and is working on a clinical trial for yet another drug.Lugo says that while Eagle's bendamustine rapid-infusion product is a ""key drug,"" the company has several other drugs in its pipeline ""which could be as promising.""Eagle is a part of IBD's Medical-Generic Drugs industry group. It has an 85 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Other members of the group include Allergan (AGN), which leads the group with a Composite Rating of 99, and Mylan (MYL), which has a 96 Composite Rating.

Novartis, which has a lot of other sources of revenue, rose 0.5%.Despite Teva's last-ditch attempt to stop the drug, the company's guidance has been assuming generic competition to its top-selling drug this year — not only from Novartis/Momenta but from Mylan (MYL) and its partner Natco Pharma. However, in December, Teva modeled a September launch for these products, so the FDA's decision suggests rivals may come a bit earlier than expected.Nonetheless, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote in an email to clients that Sandoz may still have to wait until September to launch.""Supreme Court decision (in January) may have validated the Sept. 2015 patent for Copaxone 20 mg ...but to be clear, Supreme Court ruled on the legalities of the case (in favor of TEVA), and remanded it back to appeals court,"" Raffat wrote. ""Unclear if Novartis interested in doing an 'at-risk' launch ahead of Sept. 2015 patent expiry.""Momenta's release said that Sandoz is ""currently evaluating launch timing.""Copaxone has been doing a bit over $4 billion annually the last few years, but analysts are forecasting a drop to $3 billion next year due to the generic competition. Teva has also been rolling out a long-acting 40mg version of Copaxone, whose patents run until 2030. The launch is still in its early stages, so much depends on Teva's being able to convert existing Copaxone users. Raffat says it has already converted 67% in regions where the drug has launched.Mylan shares rose 0.8% intraday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

Perrigo's stock also hit a new high, cruising nearly 30% past 212, though it was up less than 22%, near 210.50, in midday trading.Wall Street analysts had been speculating that Mylan would be involved in some major M&A, but the most popular idea had been a combination with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA). In fact, just hours before the news broke, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott theorized in a research note that Mylan could go for upward of $80 a share in such a deal. However, he added that ""we believe Mylan could look at its own larger M&A transactions.""Mylan is one of the highest-rated stocks among large drugmakers, sporting an IBD Composite Rating of 97. Perrigo was formerly a top-rating stock but its profit growth has recently flattened out, leaving a CR of 82.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

591,MYL,"Generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) late Monday reported Q4 earnings and 2015 guidance in line with Wall Street's expectations, shortly after closing a major buyout.Mylan's profit rose 35% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.05 a share, exactly as analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue gained 15% to $2.08 billion, slightly above consensus of $2.07 billion.Still, Mylan stock was down nearly 2% in after-hours trading Monday, after the company released its December-quarter results.For the year, profit rose 23% to $3.56 a share, with revenue up 12% to $7.72 billion.On Friday, Mylan closed its stock-swap deal to acquire Abbott Laboratories' (ABT) business selling generic drugs in developed markets, which both added about $2 billion in annual revenue and officially relocated the company to the lower-tax Netherlands. This was reflected in Mylan's 2015 guidance: sales of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion with EPS of $4 to $4.30. Both guidance ranges bracketed consensus.""We are off to a great start in 2015 with the recent completion of our acquisition of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business and the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Famy Care's women's health care businesses, and we expect that Mylan will deliver 33% revenue growth and 21% adjusted diluted EPS growth on a constant currency basis in 2015,"" Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said in a statement. ""In addition to these exciting activities, and as we have previously stated, you can continue to expect us to aggressively pursue additional acquisition opportunities that make financial and strategic sense for our company.""Mylan holds an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97, which is likely to improve as its growth ramps up. The stock has been forming a possible flat base since it hit a new high of 59.60 on Nov. 28.In regular trading on the stock market today, Mylan stock rose 1% to close at 57.89.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

594,MYL,"The Big Cap 20 is showing itself to be a good representation of today's market leadership, as technology, health care and consumer stocks dominate the list.A glance of the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables shows chips, medical, apparel, retail and other technology sectors make up most of the top 10 sectors. That's a fitting reflection of what you find in the Big Cap 20. Most of the 20 stocks can be categorized in one of those areas.In technology, a couple of chipmakers rank among the leading big caps, along with some business-service tech companies.Analog Devices (ADI) is one of the more interesting charts. The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base on Feb. 17 and has risen 3% from that entry.The chipmaker earned 63 cents a share excluding items for the January-ended quarter, beating expectations. Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%. Sales rose 18% to $2.08 billion.Mylan forecast 2015 revenues of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion.In consumer stocks, the big cap leaders run the gamut of auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Starbucks (SBUX) and discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST).Ross Stores shined Friday as its earnings report sent shares gapping up to a 7% gain and a record high.For the first two months of 2015, the Big Cap 20 has acquitted itself quite satisfactorily. It rose 6.9%, far better than the 2.2% gain for the S&P 500, which is a broad gauge of big-capitalization stocks.Qorvo (QRVO) may be an unfamiliar name on a list filled with familiar brands.

Endo and Valeant reversed lower, while Salix soared 7% to a new high.Mylan (MYL) rallied 7% as the stock broke out of a flat base.

677,MYL,"With a top IBD Composite Rating of 99 and four straight quarters of accelerated EPS growth, generic drug maker Akorn (AKRX) is already doing pretty well. A new analyst report outlines even more reasons to be bullish on the stock for 2015.Lake Forest, Ill.-based Akorn makes diagnostic and therapeutic ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, niche hospital drugs and injectable pharmaceuticals. Much of its attention this year has focused on a pair of high-profit deals: Akorn's $650 million April buyout of Hi-Tech Pharmacal and its May acquisition of VPI Holdings for around $440 million.Akorn regularly delivers double-digit revenue growth and has grown EPS in double digits the last three quarters.In a new report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky cites a few reasons why investors should be bullish about Akorn in the new year: Expect easy earnings beat for Akorn. Akorn is due to report its 2014 fourth-quarter results during the first week in March. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 45 cents vs. 14 cents a year earlier.After hosting a recent breakfast with Akorn Chief Financial Officer Tim Dick, Stanicky sees no reason why the company shouldn't breeze past fourth-quarter views: ""The 4Q run-rate already implies a low hurdle against consensus. We're leaving forecasts unchanged and expect AKRX to exclude 'new' approvals per usual, but at this point we think the ultimate earnings power will ultimately come in well above Street forecasts."" 14 recent Akorn product approvals should benefit 2015. These 14 products collectively target a market opportunity of about $900 million, Stanicky noted, and all but three have four or fewer competitors.""Only tobramycin (September), gatifloxacin (October) and atropine sulfate (December) have launched, implying that most of the benefit will fall into 2015,"" Stanicky said. Akorn's competitive advantage. In July, Akorn received Food and Drug Administration approval for its atropine sulfate 1% ophthalmic solution, which is used before eye exams and to treat certain eye conditions. The product launched in January .Stanicky calls this a ""three-player market,"" with Akorn joining Novartis (NVS) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX). However, he expects the other competitors ""to be removed"" and that there is a ""major re-pricing opportunity"" for Akorn to be ""a single market player.""Akorn belongs to IBD's Medical-Generic Drugs group, which ranks No. 17 among 197 industries tracked. Others in the group with 99 Composite Ratings include Actavis (ACT), Mylan (MYL) and Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO). Composite Ratings are IBD's proprietary stock ranking that factors in things such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.Akorn shares initially rose Thursday morning in the stock market today but reversed along with the major market averages. Akorn stock peaked at 45.25 on Oct. 22. After a steep sell-off, shares moved sideways in an up-and-down fashion. Akorn stock retook its 50-day moving average on Jan. 8 and is trying to work on the right side of a base.

"
763,MYL,"The Sovaldi licensing deal includes the big names in the Indian drug business, such as Ranbaxy Labs and Cipla, as well as U.S.-based Mylan (MYL). The drugmakers will be able to set their own prices for their versions of sofosbuvir, as Sovaldi is called generically, presumably at a serious discount to its U.S. price of $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment. Gilead has already priced the drug much lower in different markets — for instance in Egypt, which is both poorer and has a severe hepatitis C problem, a round of treatment only costs about $1,800. Gilead pointed out in its press release that this strategy was first developed for Gilead's HIV drugs such as Viread and Truvada, which made Gilead's original fortune but were otherwise priced out of reach of many people throughout the world who need them.

Gilead is currently awaiting U.S. approval of a sofosbuvir/ledipasvir pill, which has shown to be better than sofosbuvir alone for treating patients with the most common genotype of the virus. Also, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Daklinza has been approved in Europe for use in combination with sofosbuvir, although the Indian companies would presumably have to make their own deal with Bristol to manufacture those together.

771,MYL,"Lowering U.S. corporate tax rates to the global norm — further, if politically feasible — would no doubt benefit our companies and investors. Moving the U.S. into the global mainstream on corporate taxes might even hold out a carrot for the political class — more corporate tax revenues.
"
772,MYL,"High U.S. corporate tax rates make no sense in an increasingly global economy. High rates don't raise the revenue they once did — an estimated 11.1% of all receipts in this fiscal year, down from 19.6% in 1969. Even worse, high rates encourage tax-driven tactics and strategies that weaken the U.S. economy.
"
773,MYL,"We've seen companies move jobs and operations to countries with lower tax rates. We've seen American companies stash nearly $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid the U.S. tax bite.
"
774,MYL,"We've seen companies such as Burger King Worldwide (BKW), Chiquita Brands International (CQB), Medtronic (MDT), AbbVie (ABBV) and Mylan (MYL) announce corporate ""inversions"" — mergers and acquisitions that transfer headquarters overseas. That's just the year's first eight months; more are likely to follow.
"
775,MYL,"The political class harrumphs and howls at this perfectly legal tax avoidance, branding companies as unpatriotic.
"
776,MYL,"Their catcalls divert attention to the politicians themselves, who already have in their hands a fiscally sound and economically sensible way to keep companies in America — lower the country's punishing corporate tax rates.
"
777,MYL,"Other countries that cut corporate rates weren't merely kowtowing to corporate power. Their politicians understood that lower taxes would help keep companies at home and bolster their nations' economies, paying off in faster growth, higher employment and added tax revenues.
"
778,MYL,"Applying Laffer's Curve
"
779,MYL,"The United States doesn't necessarily have to choose between larger budget deficits and fixing an onerous corporate tax system that's out of step with the rest of the world.
"
780,MYL,"In the 1970s, economist Arthur Laffer famously put forward the proposition that tax rates can be so high they choke off economic activity and actually reduce revenue. If so, lowering rates will raise tax receipts. This could very well be the case for U.S. corporate taxes.
"
781,MYL,"In 2007, American Enterprise Institute economists Kevin Hassett and Alex Brill determined the tax-revenue-maximizing top U.S. corporate rate went from 34% in the late 1980s to 26.7% in 2005.
"
782,MYL,"Reasons for the decline: increasing international mobility of capital and other countries' cuts in corporate tax rates.
"
783,MYL,"Other countries have kept on cutting their corporate tax rates since 2005, so the revenue-maximizing rate has probably come down a few percentage points since then. But we'll stick with Hassett and Brill's 26.7% and see where it takes us.
"
784,MYL,"For the U.S., going down to the revenue-maximizing rate would add about a third to corporate tax receipts. Why? Lower taxes reduce the incentives for moving abroad and stashing profits overseas.
"
785,MYL,"More important, it would encourage both American and foreign companies to expand and invest in the United States, raising overall economic growth, corporate earnings and tax receipts.
"
786,MYL,"Sound too good to be true? The Tax Foundation's William McBride took a look at Canada. From 1988-2000, with the top rate at 43%, corporate tax revenues averaged 2.9% of GDP.
"
787,MYL,"Since 2000, as the country reduced rates to 26%, corporate tax revenues rose to 3.3% of GDP. By comparison, the high U.S. corporate tax rates have yielded average revenues of just 2.3% of GDP.
"
788,MYL,"Cutting U.S. corporate tax rates would raise both before- and after-tax earnings — good news for companies and their shareholders.
"
789,MYL,"The before-tax kick comes from greater incentives to do business in the U.S., so we'd see more companies stay home, more transplants from overseas, more new businesses, more investment from both domestic and foreign sources, and more economic growth — all leading to higher corporate revenues and profits.
"
790,MYL,"After-tax gains are more direct: For every $100 in profits, firms would now keep $73 rather than $61. Stock price gains will depend on several factors — including how much actual tax relief U.S. companies get and whether other countries respond with more tax cuts. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the market gains could be substantial in going from today's high rates to 26.7% or even lower.
"
791,MYL,"With corporate tax rates closer to the worldwide norm, the U.S. will find it easier to change another flaw in its corporate tax system. We are one of a handful of countries that tax worldwide revenues, forcing American companies to pay high U.S. rates on their overseas earnings. Most other countries use a territorial approach, taxing only the profits earned within their country.
"
792,MYL,"England switched to a territorial system in 2009, so British companies that make profits in Ireland pay the country's 12.5% — and that's all. A U.S. multinational pays 12.5% in Ireland, but it still owes U.S. taxes on its Irish earnings — the difference between Ireland's low rate and the much higher U.S. rate.
"
793,MYL,"For years now, both Democrats and Republicans have called for cutting U.S. corporate tax rates, but nothing's been done — another sign of the paralysis gripping our nation's capital.
"
794,MYL,"The hubbub over Burger King's proposed move to Canada wasn't encouraging. Members of Congress and the administration seemed more interested in chastising the corporate escapees than in lowering the tax penalty they've imposed on doing business here.

The average top rate for 34 non-U.S. countries went from 36.9% in 1993 to 25.1% in 2014.The United States has bucked the trend, stubbornly clinging to a top rate of slightly more than 39% — 35% at the federal level, plus an average 4.1% for states.The Tax Foundation scoured 163 countries, finding only two with top corporate tax burdens higher than the U.S. — the United Arab Emirates (55%) and Chad (40%).Adopting Global NormsLowering U.S. corporate tax rates to the global norm — further, if politically feasible — would no doubt benefit our companies and investors.

"
817,MYL,"Medical product giants St. Jude Medical and Abbott Laboratories both beat analysts' Q2 expectations and raised their guidance Wednesday, but their shares had a bumpy ride on the market amid a fresh attack on drug-industry mergers.Abbott (ABT) reported its first sales beat in six quarters. Revenue rose 2% to $5.55 billion, about $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 17% to 54 cents a share, beating estimates by 4 cents.The company added a few pennies to its full-year EPS guidance, now $2.19 to $2.29. Analysts' average was $2.19. On the conference call with analysts to discuss the results, Abbott CFO Thomas Freyman said revenue should rise in the low to mid-single digits, which is on the high side of analysts' expectation of 2.6% growth.Freyman also guided Q3 sales growth in a similar range, and said earnings should be 59 to 61 cents, up from 55 cents a year ago. Both were in line with Street estimates.""ABT has been a bit of a 'show me' story in the last few quarters as the company worked through headwinds in its established products (i.e. generic drugs) and nutritionals businesses,"" Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a research note Wednesday. ""But now with a sales and EPS beat in hand prompting an EPS guidance raise, and recent transactions executed to optimize the portfolio — including the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals, a Chilean-based branded generics company, and the divestiture of its developed-markets (established products) businesses — ABT may be nearing a potential sales growth inflection point.""On Monday, Abbott announced it was selling its developed-markets established products business to Mylan (MYL), which plans to take the opportunity to re-incorporate in the Netherlands, following a virtual stampede of U.S. drugmakers to lower-tax countries.On Wednesday, however, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issued a letter to Congress urging a moratorium on such arrangements until comprehensive tax reform is enacted. Lew wanted the ban to be retroactive to May.""Our view is that caution is certainly warranted concerning pending and recently announced deals, such as Mylan's announced acquisition of Abbott's established products business,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris wrote in a research note Wednesday.Perhaps because of this, Abbott's stock seesawed in trading Wednesday, opening up 1% and then dropping at midday before eventually closing down a fraction, at 41.05.But analysts were impressed with Abbott's cost controls, resulting in improvements to the gross profit margin that RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said made for ""a quality beat.""And Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis projects a 200-basis-point improvement in operating margin in the second half of this year.St. Jude (STJ), which has no plans for a tax inversion, said earnings rose 6% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.02 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 2 cents. Sales climbed 3% to $1.45 billion, vs. the Street's $1.44 billion.The company guided Q2 EPS at 95 cents to 97 cents, bracketing consensus, but sales guidance of $1.315 billion to $1.395 billion missed analysts' $1.399 billion. For the year, St. Jude guided EPS of $3.96 to $4.01 and sales of $5.64 billion to $5.76 billion, slightly higher than previous guidance and in line with expectations.St. Jude Sees Share GainsOn its conference call to discuss results, St. Jude CEO Daniel Starks said growth should start accelerating in the second half of the year, due mainly to new product launches. He said the ramping should continue into next year, with revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits vs. this year's expected 3% to 5% range.Starks also said St. Jude is still gaining share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) market. Sales of that division rose 2% to $733 million, although St. Jude says the overall market continues to shrink. Starks admitted, however, that in the first quarter the firm didn't know exactly what the ICD market was doing until rivals Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT) had reported their quarters later. The Q2 earnings from Medtronic and Boston Scientific are still down the road. Their Q1 results, however, had indicated that St. Jude gained 100 basis points of market share.Still, analyst Antalffy wrote that St. Jude's guidance was disappointing given the Q2 beat. She also pointed out that the stock is richly valued — it hit an all-time high of 71.90 on July 7. In trading Wednesday, it did almost the reverse of Abbott, dropping nearly 2% early before recovering somewhat to close down nearly 1%, at 67.66.

939,MYL,"Actavis (ACT) is holding tight near its recent high and remains in a buy area after clearing a flat-base entry at 133.10.The drugmaker is just 1% above the buy point after breaking out July 26 in more than double its average daily volume after a strong quarterly earnings report. The stock has gone sideways since then, but the tight trading is a sign it's holding up well even with the market uptrend coming under pressure.The base is third stage, however, reducing its chances of success.Actavis, formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, is the top stock in the 13-member Medical-Generic Drugs industry group, which includes fellow IBD 50 stock Mylan (MYL). The group was ranked 54th out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, as of Friday.Actavis develops generic and branded drugs to treat diseases such as hypertension and high cholesterol. It boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating and a 97 Earnings Per Share Rating, both best in the group. Its Accumulation-Distribution Rating is A+, indicating strong demand for the shares.The company announced July 26 that Q2 profit rose 42% to $2.01 a share, edging above Wall Street's expectations. Revenue rose 47% to $1.99 billion, accelerating for the second-straight quarter.Zacks Equity Research said Thursday that Actavis' plan to acquire Ireland-based Warner Chilcott (WCRX) would create a ""leading global specialty pharmaceutical company"" with annual revenues of about $11 billion.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is an elevated 163%.The acquisition is expected to close later this year. On Friday, France's Competition Authority approved the deal.Actavis also recently acquired the global rights to Palau Pharmaceuticals' antifungal drug Albaconazole, which is in phase II trials.
"
940,MYL,"Actavis (ACT), a generic-drug maker with designs on building its branded drugs business, has plenty of reason to feel good about its future.
"
941,MYL,"For one thing, the company got shareholder approval Sept. 10 on its $8.5 billion buyout of Irish drugmaker Warner Chilcott (WCRX), setting the stage for the creation of what will become the third-largest specialty pharmaceutical firm in the U.S.
"
942,MYL,"For another, Actavis this week launched a generic version of Lidoderm, a patch used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia, occurring after a shingles infection.
"
943,MYL,"Lidoderm, whose branded version is made by Endo Health Solutions (ENDP), has annual U.S. sales of around $1.2 billion.
"
944,MYL,"While generic Lidoderm should provide an immediate boost to Actavis' sales, most of the recent attention has focused on long-term prospects of its Warner Chilcott buyout.
"
945,MYL,"Actavis in May announced plans to acquire Warner Chilcott, which specializes in branded drugs for women's health, gastroenterology, dermatology and urology. Shareholders of both companies gave the deal the thumbs up on Sept. 10.
"
946,MYL,"One benefit of the deal is that it cuts Actavis' dependence on its core generic drugs business, about three quarters of revenue last year.
"
947,MYL,"Buyout Benefits
"
948,MYL,"With Warner Chilcott aboard, Actavis should get about 25% of revenue from specialty brand products vs. 7% as a standalone company.
"
949,MYL,"""It's a good combination that will definitely make Actavis a much bigger company on the branded side,"" said Tim Chiang, analyst at CRT Capital Group.
"
950,MYL,"The deal should close by the end of the year. It is expected to be more than 30% accretive to Actavis' non-GAAP EPS in 2014, including anticipated synergies.
"
951,MYL,"One priority on that front is to help Warner Chilcott improve its financial performance. The company has run off 10 straight quarters of sales declines and three straight quarters of lower earnings.
"
952,MYL,"While those numbers won't win any prizes, Actavis isn't expected to implement any big changes.
"
953,MYL,"""They won't do anything drastic to turn things around,"" said Kevin Kedra, analyst at Gabelli & Co. ""Warner Chilcott fits in very nicely with the specialty pharma business Actavis has, so I expect they will continue to run the business similar to what Warner has done. It will be more a function of pulling out the strengths of both companies.""
"
954,MYL,"One positive is that Actavis has plenty of experience integrating acquisitions. The company frequently makes tuck-in acquisitions of smaller generic drug firms, and it occasionally makes the whopper deal along the lines of Warner Chilcott.
"
955,MYL,"The current incarnation of Actavis was formed in October when it completed a $5.6 billion merger with Watson Pharmaceuticals.
"
956,MYL,"""Actavis does a lot of deals, and they've executed them well,"" Kendra said. ""The deals in generic drugs tend to be very accretive.""
"
957,MYL,"In a report, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the merger with Watson and buyout of Warner Chilcott represent ""highly transformational"" steps for Actavis.
"
958,MYL,"The deals ""will significantly increase the company's profile both in the U.S. and internationally in brands and generics,"" Schott added.
"
959,MYL,"After the Warner Chilcott deal closes, Actavis is expected to produce about $11 billion in annual revenue. Last year it logged $5.9 billion in revenue. The new entity will incorporate in Ireland, which should produce tax benefits.
"
960,MYL,"Financially, Actavis has had a much better go of it than Warner Chilcott. Actavis has delivered double-digit sales growth nine quarters in row, while earnings have risen in double digits in nine of the last 10 quarters.
"
961,MYL,"Generics Lift Sales
"
962,MYL,"The company posted second-quarter earnings of $2.01 a share, excluding special items. That was up from $1.42 the prior year and 2 cents above consensus analyst views. Revenue gained 47% to $1.99 billion, edging past estimates for $1.98 billion.
"
963,MYL,"Generic drug sales led the way during the quarter, rising 58% to $1.57 billion. Sales of specialty drugs, which include Rapaflo for enlarged prostates and Kadian for pain management, climbed 21% to $144.8 million. Sales in Actavis' distribution business rose 14% to $275.8 million.
"
964,MYL,"Analysts expect Actavis to grow full-year earnings 39% to $8.33 a share.
"
965,MYL,"The company should get a nice lift from generic Lidoderm, which got final approval from the Food and Drug Administration in August 2012 while it was still owned by Watson Pharmaceuticals.
"
966,MYL,"Under terms of an agreement with Endo, the actual product launch was delayed more than a year to Sept. 16.
"
967,MYL,"""Actavis will be the only one out there with (generic Lidoderm), so it will be a nice boost to the generics business,"" Kedra said.
"
968,MYL,"Even as Actavis moves closer to finalizing its deal with Warner Chilcott, analysts expect the company to keep pursuing buyouts over the next several quarters.
"
969,MYL,"""We would not be surprised to see Actavis pursue another larger branded transaction at some point over the next 18 to 24 months if the right asset were available,"" JPMorgan's Schott noted.
"
970,MYL,"He reckons the main target areas will be gastrointestinal, dermatology and fertility drugs.

The company frequently makes tuck-in acquisitions of smaller generic drug firms, and it occasionally makes the whopper deal along the lines of Warner Chilcott.The current incarnation of Actavis was formed in October when it completed a $5.6 billion merger with Watson Pharmaceuticals.""Actavis does a lot of deals, and they've executed them well,"" Kendra said. ""The deals in generic drugs tend to be very accretive.""In a report, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the merger with Watson and buyout of Warner Chilcott represent ""highly transformational"" steps for Actavis.The deals ""will significantly increase the company's profile both in the U.S. and internationally in brands and generics,"" Schott added.After the Warner Chilcott deal closes, Actavis is expected to produce about $11 billion in annual revenue. Last year it logged $5.9 billion in revenue. The new entity will incorporate in Ireland, which should produce tax benefits.Financially, Actavis has had a much better go of it than Warner Chilcott. Actavis has delivered double-digit sales growth nine quarters in row, while earnings have risen in double digits in nine of the last 10 quarters.Generics Lift SalesThe company posted second-quarter earnings of $2.01 a share, excluding special items. That was up from $1.42 the prior year and 2 cents above consensus analyst views. Revenue gained 47% to $1.99 billion, edging past estimates for $1.98 billion.Generic drug sales led the way during the quarter, rising 58% to $1.57 billion. Sales of specialty drugs, which include Rapaflo for enlarged prostates and Kadian for pain management, climbed 21% to $144.8 million. Sales in Actavis' distribution business rose 14% to $275.8 million.Analysts expect Actavis to grow full-year earnings 39% to $8.33 a share.The company should get a nice lift from generic Lidoderm, which got final approval from the Food and Drug Administration in August 2012 while it was still owned by Watson Pharmaceuticals.Under terms of an agreement with Endo, the actual product launch was delayed more than a year to Sept. 16.""Actavis will be the only one out there with (generic Lidoderm), so it will be a nice boost to the generics business,"" Kedra said.Even as Actavis moves closer to finalizing its deal with Warner Chilcott, analysts expect the company to keep pursuing buyouts over the next several quarters.""We would not be surprised to see Actavis pursue another larger branded transaction at some point over the next 18 to 24 months if the right asset were available,"" JPMorgan's Schott noted.He reckons the main target areas will be gastrointestinal, dermatology and fertility drugs.Actavis shares have been trending higher since late February and hit a record high of 140.97 on Sept. 5. The stock currently trades near 138.Other generic-drug companies that have set new highs recently include Mylan (MYL) and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries (TARO).

976,MYL,"Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) beat analysts' Q2 earnings estimates Wednesday, and raised its guidance to account for its completed acquisition of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb.
"
977,MYL,"The stock, already trading near record highs, hit a new peak of 97.60 early Wednesday before closing at 97.59, up 2%.
"
978,MYL,"Valeant reported cash EPS of $1.34 a share, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter and 7 cents above analysts' consensus. Sales rose 34% to $1.1 billion, in line with estimates.
"
979,MYL,"The company closed its $8.7 billion buyout of Bausch & Lomb on Tuesday, and consequently raised its full-year guidance by quite a bit. The management added more than $1 billion to the sales range, now $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion. The EPS range is $6 to $6.20, vs. previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.85. It posted 2012 EPS of $4.51 on sales of $3.55 billion.
"
980,MYL,"On an earnings conference call with analysts, CFO Howard Schiller said Valeant expects to exceed its $800 million target in cost savings from the merger, and plans to reduce the combined head count by 10% to 15%. Most of this would come from general and administrative expenses, with little impact on the sales force. Although branded pharmaceuticals still make up the majority of the combined business, Schiller pointed out that three-quarters of revenue now comes from cash payments or private insurance, which is significant given the pricing pressures on drugs from government payers, especially in Europe.
"
981,MYL,"Morningstar analyst David Krempa, in a research report, cautioned that the deal synergies will be partly offset by higher-than-expected interest rates, and that Valeant will still be a relatively small player in ophthalmology vs. rivals such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS). Nonetheless, he added, ""we still believe Valeant and its exemplary stewardship are being undervalued by the market.""
"
982,MYL,"The highly acquisitive Valeant is already swollen this quarter from its $344 million buyout of skin-cream maker Obagi Medical Products, which closed in late April. The Obagi buyout in turn complemented last year's $2.6 billion acquisition of Medicis, which brought Valeant Dysport, an anti-wrinkle injection similar to Allergan's (AGN) Botox. On the conference call, Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said Dysport was gaining market share on Botox and the other rival, Merz's Xeomin.
"
983,MYL,"Excluding the impact of these and various smaller buyouts, sales rose a more modest 4% in developed markets and 14% in emerging markets. Developed-market sales took a hit from the unexpected early entry of generic competition for herpes cream Zovirax, after Mylan (MYL) won FDA approval for its knock-off in early April. Pearson said this pushed U.S. promoted-product sales down 5%, though apart from Zovirax the rest of the portfolio grew 7%.
"
984,MYL,"Outside the U.S., Eastern Europe was a standout with 16% organic growth in Russia in the first half of the year, and 11% in Poland. Mexico also did well with 8% organic growth. Pearson noted there had been a slowdown in Latin America's overall market growth, but said Valeant had managed to outperform.
"
985,MYL,"Pearson also offered up Valeant's annual review of the performance of recent large acquisitions, which in this case covered 17 deals from October 2008 through 2012. Overall, the compound annual growth rate from the acquired companies was 12%. Brazilian nutritionals company Probiotica led the way with 77% growth since its February 2012 buyout.
"
986,MYL,"Valeant was pulling less than $1 billion in annual revenue as recently as 2009, but Pearson has repeatedly said he plans to turn the company into a large global drugmaker. This led UBS analyst Marc Goodman to ask him on the call whether Valeant was going to have to go into more mainstream products in order to get even bigger.
"
987,MYL,"Pearson answered that Valeant's strategy remains the same. ""We think we can be successful by not doing what large pharma companies are doing,"" he said. ""We did put a big aspiration out there, but that's our approach, it's motivational to our people and certainly that (is what) we hope to achieve.""Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) beat analysts' Q2 earnings estimates Wednesday, and raised its guidance to account for its completed acquisition of contact-lens giant Bausch & Lomb.The stock, already trading near record highs, hit a new peak of 97.60 early Wednesday before closing at 97.59, up 2%.Valeant reported cash EPS of $1.34 a share, up 33% from the year-earlier quarter and 7 cents above analysts' consensus.

1050,MYL,"Five years ago, Mylan (MYL) became the third-largest generic-drug company in the world, catapulted by two acquisitions totaling around $7 billion.
"
1051,MYL,"But in late October, Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) overtook Mylan when it bought Swiss partner Actavis in a deal valued at $5.9 billion. Mylan dropped to No. 4.
"
1052,MYL,"So Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and the Swiss firm Novartis (NVS) remain the top two generic-drug firms worldwide.
"
1053,MYL,"But Mylan may get bigger again.
"
1054,MYL,"Management says it has the ""financial flexibility"" to put as much as $4 billion to work to make one or more acquisitions.
"
1055,MYL,"""We are looking. And if the right opportunity presents itself, we will take advantage of it,"" said Chief Financial Officer John Sheehan in a phone interview this week.
"
1056,MYL,"Analysts say a buy or two may help offset an expected drop in the number of brands going off patent in the U.S. after 2012's banner year. It would mute concerns of slowing growth, especially in what is seen as 2014's ""patent cliff.""
"
1057,MYL,"Fewer brands going off patent generally means fewer opportunities for generics to replace them.
"
1058,MYL,"Branded Drugs
"
1059,MYL,"""This year is a good year for Mylan and also other generic manufacturers because of the largest number of branded drugs coming off patent,"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse. ""All the generic companies have posted good growth numbers.""
"
1060,MYL,"Mylan's third-quarter revenue jumped 15% from the prior year to $1.8 billion. Third-quarter operating cash flow was ""the highest in our history,"" Sheehan said.
"
1061,MYL,"Management wouldn't talk about specifics of potential candidates other than that it's looking ""across the globe,"" as Sheehan put it.
"
1062,MYL,"But analysts believe they're looking at generic-drug companies in emerging markets and manufacturers of injectable or topical drugs.
"
1063,MYL,"Mylan gets the lion's share of its sales from generic drugs, which are low-cost copies of branded drugs. It sells more than 1,100 generic products.
"
1064,MYL,"It also sells several branded drugs through its specialty pharma business, which focuses on respiratory diseases, severe allergic reactions and psychiatric disorders.
"
1065,MYL,"Its EpiPen product is the top prescribed auto-injector for treating severe allergic reactions.
"
1066,MYL,"Mylan's EpiPen franchise could be threatened by a potential generic entry from Teva in 2015.
"
1067,MYL,"Mylan's India-based subsidiary, Mylan Laboratories, makes a wide range of ingredients used in drug manufacturing, including those for generic antiretrovirals for treating HIV/AIDS.
"
1068,MYL,"An acquisition outside the U.S. is viewed as especially favorable.
"
1069,MYL,"""Mylan is heavily exposed to the U.S. and southern Europe,"" said Waterhouse, adding that 50% of its generic sales are in the U.S. vs. only 20% for Teva.
"
1070,MYL,"Sheehan defends Mylan's high U.S. share. ""If you are going to be the largest someplace, I'd want to be the largest in the U.S.,"" he said. ""I'm not sure Europe is the best place to be the largest.""
"
1071,MYL,"But Waterhouse says Mylan is one of the most exposed to Europe of any generic-drug company in Morningstar's coverage.
"
1072,MYL,"Up until the second quarter of this year, Mylan's European business showed eight straight quarters of negative growth. However, it showed a 3% gain in Q3 revenue vs. the earlier year.
"
1073,MYL,"In Europe, Mylan is strongest in France, with around 30% market share in generics.
"
1074,MYL,"France and other countries in austerity-minded Europe are now encouraging higher use of low-cost generic drugs, Sheehan says.
"
1075,MYL,"""We see Europe as a long-term growth driver as generic utilization rates increase,"" he said.
"
1076,MYL,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Shibani Malhotra agrees. ""There is so much underutilization of generics (outside the the U.S.), even in Europe, that ultimately (generics) is a growth market,"" he said.
"
1077,MYL,"Waterhouse doesn't expect Mylan to ink one big deal because it still has a lot of debt on its balance sheet, but perhaps smaller ones. It's been paying down debt since its transformative acquisitions in 2007. But long-term debt was still $4.8 billion in Q3.
"
1078,MYL,"Mylan had spent $6.8 billion for German-based Merck KGaA (unrelated to the U.S.-based Merck (MRK) and more than $700 million for 72% of India-based Matrix, since renamed Mylan Labs (later paying $133 million for the rest).
"
1079,MYL,"Merck KGaA gave Mylan more exposure to Europe and other countries.
"
1080,MYL,"Matrix gave Mylan low-cost manufacturing plants in India and China. Those operations contributed to Mylan's Asia-Pacific revenue growth of 9.2% in Q3, to $339.2 million, including the negative impact of foreign exchange translation.
"
1081,MYL,"Strong Earnings
"
1082,MYL,"Long-term debt is ""obviously a big number,"" Sheehan said, ""but it's in relation to the size of the company.""
"
1083,MYL,"He says the ""vast majority"" of any acquisition would be done through borrowing.
"
1084,MYL,"But the firm's strong earnings, not to mention assumed earnings of a target company, would enable it to borrow ""without overleveraging the enterprise.""
"
1085,MYL,"Mylan's earnings in Q3 grew 51% over the prior year to 83 cents a share. Analysts expect full-year profit of $2.83 a share, up 26%, on revenue of $6.8 billion, for an 11% increase, reports Thomson Reuters.
"
1086,MYL,"But analysts see profit slowing to the single digits in 2013 through at least 2015.
"
1087,MYL,"Mylan doesn't see it that way.
"
1088,MYL,"""We see the patent cliff affecting generic companies differently,"" Sheehan said. ""For example, in 2012, we have 378 products in the U.S. market. By 2015 we will have 596.""
"
1089,MYL,"Mylan is counting on getting U.S. approval for a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) branded respiratory drug Advair, for one.
"
1090,MYL,"Meanwhile, Mylan's recently announced partnership in Japan with Pfizer (PFE) should begin bearing fruit starting at year-end.
"
1091,MYL,"Mylan continues to forecast double-digit earnings growth ""beyond 2013."" But its 2013 forecast of $2.76 a share is just 6.6% higher than Wall Street's 2012 forecast.

They took in $3 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, in the U.S. last year.Falling off in 2012: Plavix from Bristol-Myers (BMY) and France's Sanofi-Aventis (SNY), with $6 billion in U.S. sales. The U.K.'s AstraZeneca (AZN) loses Seroquel and Crestor — and Nexium in 2014.Other big names to fade in 2012 include Merck's (MRK) Singulair and Forest Laboratories' (FRX) Lexapro.By 2015, global market share for branded drugs will fall to 53%, from 64% in 2010 and 70% in 2005, says the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics.

1129,MYL,"Several slices of the medical sector are in the top echelon of IBD's 197 industry groups.The top two are Medical-Biomed/Biotech and Medical-Services groups rank Nos. 5 and 6, going into Monday. That was up from 7 and 14 three weeks ago.Mutual funds are among the big buyers and big beneficiaries.The $1.2 billion Franklin DynaTech was among 140 funds that opened a stake in their latest disclosure periods in the Biomed/Biotech group's Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN).Two more examples: $2.2 billion Fidelity Select Health Care and the $3 billion BlackRock U.S. Opportunities are among 107 funds that started positions in  SXC Health Solutions (SXCI) in their latest disclosures. SXC is in Medical-Services.Other medical groups posting high rankings, which are based on six-month price performance, are Medical-Supplies, which jumped to No. 17 from 103.Medical-Systems/Equipment is No. 29, down from No. 9. Three more medical groups are in the top 52.In addition to Alexion and SXC, leaders of the groups are  Align Technology (ALGN) in Medical-Supplies, Bio-Reference Labs (BRLI) in Medical-Services, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) in Medical-Systems/Equipment, Questor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR) in Medical-Ethical Drugs and Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) in Medical-Generic Drugs.Individual growth stories help explain the variety of leaders across several industry groups, said Phil Seligman, analyst for S&P Capital IQ.Also, investors have tilted toward health-care stocks in general as traditional safe havens in volatile markets, such as the current one, said Steven Silver, another analyst for S&P Capital IQ.Room To RunAlign Technology is driven by its Invisalign orthodontic system, which does not use ceramic and metal brackets.Its market share has room to grow in the U.S. and abroad, especially in China, Seligman says.Shares are up 25% this year. Sales rose 24% each of the past two years. Shares gapped up 16% April 24, the day after the company said first-quarter earnings per share rose 29% to 27 cents, beating views by 6 cents.Seligman also likes the outlook for Intuitive Surgical despite its 14% fall off its April 18 peak.It fell in the broad market pullback, he says. And quarterly sales and EPS growth have stayed strong as demand for its surgical systems holds up despite slow GDP growth.S&P analyst Herman Saftas says Watson has a better fundamental outlook than peers like Teva (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL). Mylan, for example, is heavily reliant on Europe.Watson's Q1 EPS growth topped estimates. But pricing pressure on its generic version of cholesterol fighter Lipitor hurt Q1 profit.Yet Watson's planned takeover of Actavis Group would boost earnings much more than its price now reflects, Saftas says.Still, not all leaders have a rosy prognosis. Alexion recently acquired Enobia Pharma. And it is testing new drugs.It reported positive phase II results for asfotase alfa, a potential treatment for the rare bone disease hypophosphatasia.But until any value of such a treatment becomes clear, Silver sees the stock as having limited upside potential.

1279,MYL,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) reported a loss per share of 63 cents in the quarter, wider than the year-ago loss of 46 cents.Revenues in the quarter came in at $4.8 million, significantly down from $26.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top-line comprises product revenues of $3.5 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared to $23.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was a result of lower sales due to Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) entry into the Copaxone market.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $1.3 million, compared with $3.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue recognized from the upfront payment from Mylan as compared to the amount recognized in the 2017 period and lower reimbursable expenses for the complex generic programs.Research and development expenses decreased to $33.2 million from $36.1 million in the year-ago quarter due to a decrease in external R&D expenses for M923. General and administrative expenses also decreased 11% to $20.6 million.Outlook ReiteratedMomenta expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $180-$200 million in 2018. Operating expenses in second-quarter 2018 are projected around $45-$55 million.Momenta expects to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis.Pipeline UpdatesMomenta announced that the FDA has finally approved Sandoz's Abbreviated New Drug Application for Glatopa 40 mg. Both companies earlier suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa. Nevertheless, Sandoz secured customer contracts and orders of Glatopa 40 mg/mL have been shipped.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its biosimilars pipeline. In January 2018, Momenta and Mylan announced plans to initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Eylea — in the first half of 2018.  The Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of Humira, is also ready to be filed with the FDA.  However, the filing of the BLA is dependent on the outcome of the Company’s ongoing strategic review.Momenta suffered a setback when the company and partner Mylan announced that M834, a proposed biosimilar for Orencia, did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan continue to evaluate the next course of action.Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes — M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3), M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody and M254. Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281.In January 2018, Momenta reported positive top-line data on M281 from a phase I single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study of normal human volunteers. The phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281.  Consequently, Momenta is finalizing its development strategy for M281 and is planning two proof of concept clinical trials in the second half of 2018, pending regulatory feedback.Meanwhile, Momenta and collaboration partner CSL began dosing subjects in the phase I trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety and tolerability of M230. The study is expected to be completed in 2019.Momenta is also on track to complete the IND-enabling toxicology study this year and expects to initiate a trial in the second half of 2018.Our TakeMomenta reported a wider year-over-year loss in the first quarter. While the FDA approval of Glatopa 40 mg should relieve Momenta, competition will limit market share gains. We note that Mylan has already won the FDA’s approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity.  Momenta’s stock has gained 65.2% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 10.9%. Following the announcement of first-quarter of 2018 results, shares were up 1.17%. Meanwhile, the progress of biosimilars pipeline was encouraging.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1280,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9, before the market opens. Mylan N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. Quote The company’s performance has been mixed so far, having topped earnings estimates in two and missing in other two of the trailing four quarters. The company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 3.53% over the said time frame.In the last reported quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 1.42%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Mylan’s stock has lost 3.3% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 6.3%.Factors to Consider This QuarterMylan expects revenues of $11.75-$13.25 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $12.45 billion. Mylan anticipates adjusted EPS of around $5.20-$5.60 in 2018, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.35.Mylan has one of the largest product portfolios among all generic pharmaceutical companies. After a challenging 2017, things are looking up for Mylan in 2018. The company got a major boost with the FDA’s approval of a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals’ (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg.Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate injection, 40 mg/mL containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. The company also received an FDA approval for Ogiviri, a biosimilar version of Herceptin.Although volatility in the U.S. market is expected to persist in 2018, yet these approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help combat the decline in EpiPen sales. The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018. The launch of generic version of Estrace cream is also underway.Meanwhile, key anticipated approvals include a biosimilar version of Neulasta with a target action date in June 2018. The company expects to launch the biosimilar in the second half assuming approval. The EMA has also accepted applications for both the biosimilars.Mylan and partner Momenta (MNTA  -  Free Report) will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of ophthalmology drug Eylea — in the first half of 2018. The trial will be a randomized, double-blind, active-control, multi-center study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with the reference drug.The company is also looking forward for a tentative approval of generic Restatis with a target action date in July 2018.However, sales from EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. Sales are expected to decline further as with mounting competition.During the earnings call, we expect investors to focus on the performance of EpiPen, newly launched drugs and the progress of the company’s biosimilars pipeline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t show that Mylan is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat on earnings.

1281,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 94 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share. However, earnings per share declined 11.3% year over year.Revenues came in at $5.1 billion, which also beat the consensus estimate of $4.8 billion. However, sales declined 10% year over year (down 15% excluding impact of currency).Sales were hurt by increased pricing erosion in the U.S. generics market and rapid erosion in sales of Teva’s key multiple sclerosis injection, Copaxone and divesture of some non-core assets. Segment DiscussionAs announced in November last year, Teva no longer reports two separate global groups for its two businesses – generics and specialty medicines. Instead, it reports under new segments based on three regions — North America, Europe and Growth Markets.North America segment sales were $2.5 billion, down 22% year over year due to pricing erosion in U.S. generics market, lower sales of Copaxone and divestiture of some non-core assets in the Women’s Health business. In the United States, revenues declined 23% to $2.4 billion.Lead branded product, Copaxone, posted sales of $476 million in North America, down 40% year over year due to generic competition for the 20 mg as well as the 40 mg formulation.Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz - Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation (Glatopa) was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than its scheduled launch in April.On the call, Teva said that despite Mylan's introduction of a 40 mg generic, Copaxone still commands around 85% of volumes in the 40 mg market. However, Teva had to decrease the price of Copaxone by increasing rebates in connection with the generic competition.  The lower pricing helped it maintain its volume share. However, Teva expects tougher competition as the year progresses, which could exert some further pressure on pricing.Sales of other branded products Bendeka, Treanda, ProAir and Qvar increased in the quarter.The newest product in Teva’s branded portfolio, Austedo, recorded sales of $30 million in North America.Austedo (SD-809) was approved and launched in April 2017 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease and for the second indication, tardive dyskinesia, in the United States in August.Generic products revenues declined 23% to $1.1 billion in the quarter due to lower volumes and price erosion. Significant competitive and pricing pressure is hurting the U.S. generics industry. The consolidation of customers in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Teva launched 10 generic products in the first quarterDistribution revenues, which are generated by Anda, rose 12% in the quarter to $331 million.In August 2016, Teva acquired Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics business – Actavis Generics – and Allergan’s Anda Inc., the fourth largest distributor of generic pharmaceuticals, in October 2016.The Europe segment recorded revenues of $1.44 billion, up 8% year over year. However, in constant currency terms, sales declined 6% due to loss of revenues from the closure of a distribution business in Hungary and divestiture of the women’s health business.Generic products (including OTC products) revenues in Europe rose 2% on a constant currency basis to $997 million due to new product launches and volume growth in OTC, partially offset by price decline. Copaxone sales declined 13% on a constant currency basis to $153 million due to price reductions following the entry of generics.In the Growth Markets, sales rose 4%. However, in constant currency terms, sales were flat in this segment as higher sales in Israel, Japan and Russia were partially offset by the effect of the deconsolidation of subsidiaries in Venezuela and loss of revenues from the sale of the women’s health business in these countries. While Generic products (including OTC) revenues declined 3% in constant currency terms to $488 million, Copaxone sales declined 24% to $16 million.The Other segment (API manufacturing business and certain contract manufacturing services) recorded revenues of $342 million, down 8% year over year due to lower API sales to third parties.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 460 basis points (bps) to 52.3% in the quarter due to lower profitability in the North America segment. Adjusted research & development expenses declined 31% from the year-ago period to $289 million due to pipeline optimization. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 20% from the year-ago level to $715 million due to cost cutting and re-structuring activities. Adjusted operating margin declined 40 bps to 28.3% in the quarter despite lower costs.2018 Outlook UppedTeva raised its 2018 sales and earnings guidance following the first-quarter beat. The revenue outlook was raised from a range of $18.3 - $18.8 billion to a range of $18.5 - $19.0 billion. The earnings guidance was raised from a band of $2.25–$2.50 per share to $2.40-2.65 per share.U.S. Generics sales are expected to decline roughly 20% from 2017 levels to approximately $4 billion in 2018 hurt by ongoing price erosion.Costs are expected to decline $1.5 billion in 2018 as a result of the company’s cost-savings initiatives.Free cash flow guidance was raised to $3.0-3.2 billion from $2.6-2.8 billion.Delay in FDA Approval of Migraine CandidateAlong with the earnings release, the company said it does not expect to get FDA approval for its pipeline candidate, fremanezumab for the prevention of chronic/episodic migraine on its PDUFA date in June. It said it expects a pre-approval inspection to take place soon. Teva expects fremanezumab to be approved and launched before the end of this year.We remind investors that in January, Teva’s partner Celltrion received an FDA warning letter for a facility in South Korea, following an inspection of the fill/finish side of the facility. This facility manufactures API for fremanezumab. In EU, a regulatory application for fremanezumab is under review.Please note that Lilly and Amgen are also on track to launch a new migraine treatment this year.Our TakeTeva beat expectations for both earnings and sales in the first quarter and also raised its full-year outlook for both the metrics. However, Teva’s stock declined more than 4% since the earnings release.Teva’s shares have declined 5.9% this year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 12.4%.The Israel-based generic drug maker had a tough 2017 as it faced significant challenges in the form of accelerated generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load of more than $30 billion.  Mylan’s earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva.Teva divested some non-core assets last year (mainly in the Women’s Health business) to cut its significant debt load. The company also has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December last year. Teva is progressing well on these re-structuring activities and still expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives. Despite the progress on the restructuring activities and the fact that its financial position seems more stable than before, we believe Teva has a long way to go before gaining stability.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

1282,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3, before the market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.81%.This generic drug maker’s shares have lost 5.1% this year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 5.9%.Teva’s earnings surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, met the same in one and missed expectations in the remaining two, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.49%. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIncreased pricing erosion, volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit, rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone and declines in sales of several other products in the Specialty segment are expected to hurt Teva’s top line in the first quarter.Significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry is hurting sales of Teva’s Generics unit. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry is resulting in increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, increased competition for its largest product - Concerta authorized generic – and stringent government regulations are also hurting sales.Meanwhile, in the Specialty segment, loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone, Azilect and Nuvigil and divesture of some non-core assets in the Women’s Health business will hurt sales.Sales of blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, Copaxone are likely to erode due to lower volumes of the 20 mg and the 40 mg formulation, which are facing generic competition. Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz - Novartis’ generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation (Glatopa) was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than its scheduled launch in April.To combat the rapid decline in sales, in December, Teva announced a restructuring plan that will see more than 25% of the company’s global workforce being laid off over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018. An update on the progress made so far on the restructuring plan is also expected on the call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Teva has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1283,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 68 cents per American depositary share in the first quarter of 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. However, earnings were up 11% at constant exchange rate (CER) compared with the year-ago figure.Shares of Glaxo were down almost 4% on Apr 25 in after-hours trading due to lower-than-expected results in the reported quarter. Moreover, the stock has lost 2.4% in a year’s time against the industry’s 3.7% growth. Quarterly revenues rose 4% at CER to $10.0 billion (£7.2 billion), driven by a strong performance at the Vaccines segment. The top line however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.3 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 7% in the United States and 4% in the International markets. On the flip side, sales in Europe were flat year over year.Glaxo reports financial figures under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered 2% revenue growth, driven by HIV drugs and respiratory disease drugs, namely Nucala and the Ellipta portfolio. This upside was partly offset by a decline in sales of older respiratory products including Seretide/Advair, Ventolin and Established Pharmaceuticals.HIV sales increased 14% on the back of 15% and 12% growth in the United States and Europe, respectively. International sales were also up 11% year over year. These encouraging numbers were driven by continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 20%) and Tivicay (sales up 24%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 52% due to a more severe generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Notably, the company’s latest product from the HIV portfolio is Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine), the first two-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV. The drug was approved in the United States last November and generated first quarterly sales of £10 million compared with £5 million registered in the previous quarter.However, last November, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) triple combination, once-daily single tablet regimen, Biktarvy (bictegravir /emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide), was approved by the FDA for HIV-1 infection treatment. This nod from the regulatory agency might pose a competitive threat to Juluca in the future quarters.Respiratory sales were flat at CER year over year. Though in the International markets, sales increased 6%, the metric declined 4% and 1% in the United States and Europe, respectively, during the quarter under review. The sales rise from the Ellipta portfolio and Nucala, were offset by a fall in sales of older products like Seretide/Advair and Ventolin.Sales of new respiratory portfolio grew at 42%, including the first quarterly contribution from the newly launched Trelegy Ellipta.Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD) yielded sales of £10 million in the United States and £1 million in the EU during the first quarter.Notably, in April, GSK announced that Trelegy Ellipta gained the FDA approval for an expanded indication. The new indication is for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.The Ellipta products recorded a 34% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing. However, this upside was offset by weak sales of Seretide/Advair (down 20%). Ventolin sales dropped 9% year over year.Immuno-inflammation drugs like Benlysta rose 21% in the quarter under discussion.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals comprises the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology plus other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 5% in the quarter under review.Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment nudged up 2% despite a slowdown in market conditions. The power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories, saw a sturdy performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive, having increased 13% year over year, primarily driven by sales of the newly launched Shingrix vaccine (prevention of shingles) in the United States. Shingrix recorded sales of £110 million in the reported quarter, driven by a favorable recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices over Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax.Moreover, the company stated that it is rapidly building a coverage for Shingrix vaccine. Presently, more than 90% patients has access to the vaccine via both Medicare and commercial channels.It is important to note that Shingrix was approved in the EU as well as in Japan last month for the given indication.In the United States, Vaccine sales soared 50% while in Europe and the international markets, the metric decreased 3% and 6%, respectively. Sales of the meningitis vaccine Bexsero increased 26% in the United States and 7% in the Europe market. While Menveo in the United States posted higher sales, the same was offset by a soft performance of the Established Vaccines, thanks to fierce competitive pressures on Infanrix and Pediarix in Europe.2018 OutlookThe company continues to expect 4-7% EPS growth at CER in 2018, if no Advair generics are launched further this year.However, in the probable event of Advair generics being introduced in the U.S. market by mid-2018, Glaxo anticipates its adjusted EPS to be flat to down 3% year over year at CER.The three companies, namely Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Novartis, trying to bring a generic version of Advair to the market have received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA. While Mylan and Hikma got a CRL last year, Novartis was forwarded the same this year, delaying the entry of generics in the U.S. market.GlaxoSmithKline plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline plc Quote Zacks RankGlaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1284,MYL,"We expect Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Allergan’s share price has declined 2.3% this year so far, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Allergan’s earnings performance has been strong, with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1.81%.Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan plc Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan plc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, the company guided first-quarter 2018 revenues  between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion while earnings per share are expected to be between $3.20 and $3.40. These numbers indicate the lowest revenue and earnings quarter for the year.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the favorable timing of physician rebating program benefited sales of Allergan’s facial aesthetics products. This benefit was absent in the first quarter of 2018, which will hurt revenues. As such, the company expects first-quarter revenue growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate. Also, generic competition for Estrace and Namenda XR will hurt sales sharply in the first quarter.While a generic version of Namenda XR was launched by Indian company, Lupin in February that of Estrace cream was launched by Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) in January.Allergan expects a generic version of Restasis, its second best-selling drug, to be launched between April and July of 2018. Meanwhile, a generic version of Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the potential impact of generic competition on key growth drivers, Restasis and Namenda XR. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Restasis is $295 million.Nonetheless, Allergan’s established products like Botox, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Juvéderm collection of fillers should support sales in Q1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox is $771 million.In fact, recent label expansions for Botox (FDA approval for forehead line treatment) and Vraylar (FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia) and Avycaz (FDA approval for HABP/VABP) should add to sales of these drugs in Q1. Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from Zeltiq (April 2017) acquisitions should continue to support the top line in the quarter.However, we believe sales erosion of Aczone due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and loss of exclusivity (LOE), mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin 24, will continue to hurt the top line.We remind investors that on the Q4 call, the company had said that it does not expect any significant M&A activities in 2018. Allergan expects to reevaluate its M&A strategy in the second half of the year once it gets through the LOEs. An update is expected at the upcoming conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.37 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.36 per share) is +0.14%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Allergan’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model. These also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is also slated to announce financial figures on May 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% and is also a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1287,MYL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MYL due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Mylan Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues MissMylan reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2017 as EpiPen sales declined. Adjusted earnings of $1.43 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 but was down from $1.57 reported in the year-ago quarter.Fourth-quarter revenues of $3.24 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion and were down 1% from the prior-year period.Quarter in DetailThe company posts results in three segments on a geographic basis namely North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment’s third-party net sales came in at $1.30 billion, down 17% on a sales decline of existing products as a result of lower volume and pricing, partially offset by contribution from new products. The generics business in North America experienced higher price erosion than the previous quarters including the impact of the loss of market exclusivity of olmesartan and olmesartan HCTZ. Sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector plunged significantly (a decrease of $131.9 million) due to effect of the launch of authorized generic and higher governmental rebates.Third-party net sales from Europe were $1.07 billion, up 16%. This was propelled by new product introductions across the region combined with volume expansion and pricing on existing products.  Favorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 9% within the continent.Rest of World segment’s third-party net sales of $815.7 million was up 12%, driven by new products and increased net sales from the anti-retroviral franchise and higher sales in the emerging markets plus a favourable foreign currency translation had an impact of 3%.Adjusted gross margin contracted to 55.5% from 56.6% in the year-ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, partially offset by the contributions from new products.During 2017, Mylan repurchased approximately 12.4 million shares for approximately $500.2 million under its previously approved share repurchase program. In January 2018, Mylan bought back additional ordinary shares worth 9.8 million for approximately $432.0 million and completed the share buyback program.2017 ResultsRevenues for 2017 came in at $11.91 billion, up 8% from 2016. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.95 billion. While adjusted EPS of $4.56 was down 7% from 2016 but surpassed the consensus mark of $4.54.2018 OutlookMylan expects revenues of $11.75-$13.25 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.64 billion is well wit hin the guidance provided by the company.Mylan anticipates adjusted EPS of around $5.20-$5.60 in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.34. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

1288,MYL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Mylan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Mylan’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE is also slightly undervalued than the Zacks Medical - Generic Drugs industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio.We should also point out that Mylan has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 7.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Mylan stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Mylan has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MYL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Mylan currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Mylan a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.3, which is far better than the industry average of 10.6. Clearly, MYL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Mylan might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D. This gives MYL a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen five up and three down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 8.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 1.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMylan is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 27% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1289,MYL,"Shares of Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) have gained 7.6% in the last three months, as against the industry’s decline of 3.7%. Mylan’s fourth-quarter results were mixed with the bottom line exceeding expectations but the top line lagging the same due to weak EpiPen sales. The generic business in the United States continues to experience pricing pressure.The year 2017 was challenging for Mylan given the ongoing pricing pressure in the United States and uncertain regulatory environment. Moreover, the company’s efforts to get Advair’s generic approved faced a jolt when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for generic Advair Diskus.However, things are looking up for Mylan in 2018. We note that Mylan got a major boost with the FDA’s approval of a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals’ (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. The company also received an FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin.Although volatility in the US markets is expected to persist in 2018, yet these  approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help it combat the decline in EpiPen sales. The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018. The launch of generic version of Estrace cream is also in the offing.Meanwhile, key anticipated approvals include a biosimilar version of Neulasta with a target action date in June 2018. The company expects to launch the biosimilar in the second half assuming approval. The EMA has also accepted applications for both the biosimilars.Meanwhile, Mylan and partner Momenta (MNTA  -  Free Report) announced that the companies will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Eylea — in the first half of 2018. The trial will be a randomized, double-blind, active-control, multi-center study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with the reference drug.We note that Eylea, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema.The company is also looking forward for a tentative approval of generic Restatis with a target action date in July 2018.Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1292,MYL,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted a positive opinion to update the label of Neulasta to include Neulasta Onpro Kit, an innovative delivery system.The Neulasta Onpro Kit combines a pre-filled syringe with a single dose of Neulasta and a single use on-body injector (OBI) delivery system.Neulasta is used to prevent the chance of infection in patients with non-myeloid cancer who receive anti-cancer therapies.The Neulasta Onpro Kit is an improved administration option for patients as it provides them an opportunity to administer the recommended dose of Neulasta at home, the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving a trip back to the doctor.The kit has been available in the United States since 2015 while commanding a market share of about 60% in the United States for all Neulasta sales.In 2017, Neulasta revenues declined 2% to $4.53 billion from the year-ago period due to lower demand. Increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta. While biosimilars are already hurting sales of Neulasta in the EU, it could start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year.Many companies are looking to get approval for biosimilar versions of Neulasta. However, three of these – Biocon/Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) Coherus Biosciences, Inc.

1293,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2017 as EpiPen sales declined. Adjusted earnings of $1.43 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 but was down from $1.57 reported in the year-ago quarter.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. Quote Fourth-quarter revenues of $3.24 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion and were down 1% from the prior-year period. Mylan’s stock has lost 10.9% over a year, better than the industry’s decline of 36.1%.Quarter in DetailThe company posts results in three segments on a geographic basis namely North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment’s third-party net sales came in at $1.30 billion, down 17% on a sales decline of existing products as a result of lower volume and pricing, partially offset by contribution from new products. The generics business in North America experienced higher price erosion than the previous quarters including the impact of the loss of market exclusivity of olmesartan and olmesartan HCTZ. Sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector plunged significantly (a decrease of $131.9 million) due to effect of the launch of authorized generic and higher governmental rebates.Third-party net sales from Europe were $1.07 billion, up 16%. This was propelled by new product introductions across the region combined with volume expansion and pricing on existing products.  Favorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 9% within the continent.Rest of World segment’s third-party net sales of $815.7 million was up 12%, driven by new products and increased net sales from the anti-retroviral franchise and higher sales in the emerging markets plus a favourable foreign currency translation had an impact of 3%.Adjusted gross margin contracted to 55.5% from 56.6% in the year-ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, partially offset by the contributions from new products.During 2017, Mylan repurchased approximately 12.4 million shares for approximately $500.2 million under its previously approved share repurchase program. In January 2018, Mylan bought back additional ordinary shares worth 9.8 million for approximately $432.0 million and completed that share buyback program.2017 ResultsRevenues for 2017 came in at $11.91 billion, up 8% from 2016. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.95 billion. While adjusted EPS of $4.56 was down 7% from 2016 but surpassed the consensus mark of $4.54. 2018 OutlookMylan expects revenues of $11.75-$13.25 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.64 billion is well within the guidance provided by the company.Mylan anticipates adjusted EPS of around $5.20-$5.60 in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.34.Our TakeMylan’s fourth-quarter results were mixed with the bottom line exceeding expectations but sales lagging the same due to weak EpiPen sales. The generic business in the United States continues to experience pricing pressure.We note that Mylan has already won an FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals’ (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. The company also received an FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin.Although volatility in the US markets is expected to continue in 2018, yet these regulatory body approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help it combat the decline in EpiPen sales. Meanwhile, the company received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its ANDA for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug Advair Diskus and is working to address the issues.Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1295,MYL,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 loss of $1.64 per share, wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.15 and the year-ago loss of $1.36.Total revenues in the quarter plunged 21.1% year over year to $4.5 million compared with the prior-year figure. This downside can mainly be attributed to lower sales from the company’s sole marketed product, Vibativ (telavancin). However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4 million.Theravance’ shares were down more than 2% on Feb 27 in after-hours trading following the earnings release, which reported wider loss. Moreover, the shares have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 8.4% versus the industry’s 0.8% increase. Quarterly DetailsVibativ generated U.S. revenues of $4.1 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% from the year-ago period. Sales decreased mainly due to the impact of generic competition in the United States.Revenues from collaborations were $0.4 million compared with $0.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.Research and development expenses were $51 million, up 21.4% from the year-ago period, mainly due to increases in employee-related costs and advancement of the company’s priority pipeline programs, partially offset by reduction in external expenses.Selling, general & administrative expenses rose 44.6% to $20.9 million, primarily on higher employee-related costs.2017 ResultsFull-year sales slumped 68.3% year over year to $15.4 million. However, the number beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.5 million.Full-year loss of $5.45 per share was wider than the year-ago tally of $4.26. Loss was also wider than the consensus mark of a loss of $4.85.Pipeline and Other UpdatesEarlier this February 2018, Theravance entered into a global collaboration agreement with Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), to jointly develop and commercialize its pan-Janus kinase inhibitor, TD-1473, for treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases.Pursuant to the above-mentioned contract, Theravance will be entitled to receive an upfront payment of $100 million and be also eligible to get potential payments of $900 million if J&J remains in the collaboration on completion of phase II activities.Also in January, Theravance along with partner Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the new drug application (NDA) for the pipeline candidate, revefenacin (TD-4208), has been accepted by the FDA for treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A response from the regulatory body is expected on Nov 13, 2018. The NDA acceptance was supported by positive data from two replicate pivotal phase III efficacy studies and a single 12-month, open-label, active comparator safety trial. In October 2016, the company reported positive data from both the phase III evaluations.2018 OutlookTheravance projects operating loss for 2018 in the range of $180-$200 million.Theravance Biopharma, Inc.

1296,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28, after market closes.The company’s performance has been mixed so far, having topped earnings estimates in two and missing in other two of the trailing four quarters. The company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.05% over the said time frame.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. Quote Last quarter, the company missed earnings estimates by 9.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Mylan’s stock has returned 34.1% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 11.0%. The approval of generic Copaxone 40mg provided a boost to the stock.Factors to Consider This QuarterThe company’s third-quarter results were dismal due to lower EpiPen sales. Nevertheless, Mylan raised the lower end of the sales guidance banking on the launch of the generic version of Copaxone.Mylan won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg in 2017. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. According to QuintilesIMS, sales of Copaxone 20mg/mL dose was approximately $700 million and for the 40 mg/mL dose was $3.64 billion for the 12-months period ending July 31, 2017.The company now expects revenues of $11.75-$12.5 billion in 2017, up from the earlier projection of $11.5-$12.5 billion.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in 2017 is $11.95 billion. The company now projects earnings per share in the range of $4.45-$4.70, up from $4.30-$4.70 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $4.55.The approval comes as silver lining for distraught Mylan given the ongoing challenges in the United States and uncertain regulatory environment. Mylan’s Specialty segment, of which EpiPen is the most significant product, continues to be weak. Sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector are anticipated to continue to decline in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch. Meanwhile, the company’s efforts to get Advair’s generic approved faced a jolt when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its ANDA for generic Advair Diskus.Nevertheless, newly launched products are likely to perform well and drive the top line. The acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business are also expected to boost the top line in the generics segment. The FDA recently approved Ogiviri, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin.  Mylan recently obtained tentative FDA approval under the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) for its New Drug Application for Dolutegravir, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Alafenamide Tablets, 50 mg/200 mg/25 mg.During the earnings call, we expect investors to focus on the performance of EpiPen, newly launched drugs and the progress of the company’s biosimilars pipeline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Mylan is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat on earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.05%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. While the rank is favorable, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.  Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is one health care stock that you can consider, as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 26 after the market closes.

1297,MYL,"Following the announcement of fourth-quarter of 2017 results, shares of Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) moved up 2.5%.The company reported earnings per share of 18 cents in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. The figure, however, was down from 60 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Revenues in the quarter came in at $64.6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $62.7 million and was up from $34.2 million in the year-ago quarter.  Momenta’s stock has gained 3.5% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 3.3%.Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top-line comprises product revenues of $13.4 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $15.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to inventory price adjustments owing to Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) entry into the Copaxone market along with a deduction of $0.6 million for reimbursing the company’s share of Glatopa-related legal expenses to Sandoz.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $51.2 million, up from $18.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a revenue recognition of $50.0 million upfront payment from CSL in fourth-quarter 2017.While, research and development expenses were up to $36.1 million from $26.4 million in the year-ago quarter, general and administrative expenses decreased 13.2% to $15.8 million.OutlookMomenta expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $180-$200 million in 2018. Operating expenses in first-quarter 2018 are projected around $45-$55 million.Momenta expects to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis.Pipeline UpdatesMomenta announced that the FDA has finally approved Sandoz's Abbreviated New Drug Application for Glatopa 40 mg. Both companies suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. In January 2018, Momenta and Mylan announced plans to initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Eylea — in the first half of 2018. An Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application has been accepted by regulatory body.The Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of Humira, is also ready to be filed with the FDA but the company is looking for a collaboration partner for the same.Momenta suffered another setback when the company and partner Mylan announced that M834, a proposed biosimilar for Orencia, did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan continue to evaluate the next course of action.Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes — M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. In January 2018, Momenta reported positive top-line data on M281 from a phase I single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study of normal human volunteers. The phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281. The candidate did not exhibit any adverse event, was well tolerated and decreased circulating IgG levels up to 89% with a mean reduction of 84% over the 98-day MAD study. In addition, the SAD portion of the study enrolled five cohorts with a total of 34 healthy adult volunteers and showed that a single dose of M281 achieved up to an 80% reduction of circulating IgG antibodies.Our TakeMomenta’s fourth-quarter results were better-than-expected driven by the receipt of an upfront payment. 2017 was challenging for the company as it faced approval delays of Glatopa 40 mg and reported disappointing results from a biosimilar candidate.While the FDA approval of Glatopa 40 mg should relieve Momenta, competition will limit market share gains. We note that Mylan has already won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity.Hence, we expect the company to face challenges in the market.

1298,MYL,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) recently announced FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Tivicay/rilpivirine and J&J’s Edurant/dolutegravir into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV.Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen. The approval of Juluca has shifted investor focus to the HIV disease space. Let’s see how companies are trying to tap into this huge market.A Note on HIVHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections and can eventually lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Globally, about 36.7 million people were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children (less than 15 years old).Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and its prevention and treatment as well as significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies, HIV and AIDS still has no cure. Notably, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2016, reaching the total number since the start of the epidemic to 35.0 million.Companies Developing HIV DrugsMarketed Therapies for HIVSeveral pharmaceutical companies are marketing drugs/therapies to treat HIV. Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product Genvoya is a bestseller, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Another company, GlaxoSmithKline has a long-standing commitment to HIV and infectious diseases. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, and developed the first medicines approved to treat HIV (AZT). The company’s other marketed HIV drugs include Triumeq and Tivicay.Other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Another pharmaceutical company Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) has received a tentative approval from the FDA for its combination tablet, comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, to treat HIV.What’s in the Pipeline?Companies are working on developing new drugs to treat, prevent and possibly cure HIV. Scientists are exploring new treatment paradigms like two-drug regimens, making therapies/drugs with improved safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Gilead’s STR bictegravir for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision next February. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone.Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor MK-1439, doravirine for HIV -1 infection and plans tofile regulatory applications for fixed-dose combination of the same,both as a single-entity tablet and a fixed-dose combination tabletconsisting of  fixed-dose combination of doravirine (DOR), lamivudine (3TC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) n late 2017.Glaxo is also developing two drug regimens are dolutegravir + lamivudineand cabotegravir + rilpivirine.As an increasing number of companies are developing drugs to treat this life threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space. Meanwhile, it is to be seen how Juluca fares in the market.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake. The original article, issued Tuesday, Nov 24, 2017, should no longer be relied upon.)

1299,MYL,"According to an Israeli newspaper, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) is expected to reduce its workforce by about 4000. Consequently, shares of the company were up by more than 5% in the pre-market trading on Nov 20. However, so far this year, the stock has been down 62.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 30.2%. As per the daily, Teva is also planning to lay off its current president of global research and development and its chief scientific officer, Michael Hayden.Meanwhile, the company is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is also confronting significant competitive and pricing pressure, thereby affecting the company’s top-line performance. Also, an increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue this year and probably in the next as well.The company’s lead branded drug, Copaxone, is witnessing declining sales for quite some time now. In October 2017, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation much earlier than expected, which was a in a major blow to Teva.Since 2015,  Glatopa — a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg — is already being marketed by Momenta and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz, while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October.Additionally, the company’s profitability is hurt by a huge debt burden accrued as a result of Teva’s $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics, in 2016.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load. The rumors of the workforce reduction plan probably cheered investors as it will save costs of the company. It remains to see if these efforts are enough to revive the company’s fortune in this challenging scenario, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.Zacks Rank Teva has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1300,MYL,"Theravance Biopharma, Inc.’s (TBPH  -  Free Report) shares rose almost 6.5% on Thursday following the approval of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (""COPD"") therapy, Trelegy Ellipta in Europe. Investors cheered the approval as Theravance has an economic interest on the royalties that Glaxo will pay to its partner Innoviva, Inc.  on global sales of Trelegy Ellipta.We note that Innoviva spun-off its biopharmaceutical operations in June 2014 into a subsidiary called Theravance Biopharma. As part of the spin-off agreement between the two entities, Theravance is eligible to receive 85% of any future payments paid by Glaxo in connection with GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs.Moreover, Glaxo is expected to pay Innoviva royalties in the range of 6.5% to 10% on global sales of Trelegy Elipta. Theravance will receive cash flows, which amount to approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of the drug.However, Theravance’s shares are down 9.4% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.4%.Trelegy Ellipta, a triple combination therapy, was granted marketing authorization in the EU as maintenance therapy for treatment of patients with COPD on Nov 16. It was approved in the United States in September this year. The product is expected to bring in blockbuster sales.Meanwhile, earlier this week, Theravance submitted a new drug application to the FDA for its COPD candidate, revefenacin, which has been developed in partnership with Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report). Revefenacin is nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”).

1301,MYL,"Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (TBPH  -  Free Report) and partner Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the new drug application for the combined entity’s key pipeline candidate, revefenacin (TD-4208), has been submitted to the FDA for treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”).Notably, revefenacin is an experimental once-daily nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”) to treat COPD.We remind investors that Theravance and Mylan entered into a development and commercialization agreement for revefenacin in February 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will codevelop revefenacin for COPD and other respiratory diseases. While Theravance will lead the U.S. registration development program, Mylan will be responsible for the product’s commercial manufacture.Shares of Theravance have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 11.3% while the broader industry has remained flat during the period. The NDA submission was supported by positive data from two replicate pivotal phase III efficacy studies and a single 12-month, open-label, active comparator safety trial. In October 2016, the company reported positive data from both the phase III studies. The programs met their primary endpoints demonstrating statistically significant improvements over placebo after 12 weeks of dosing for each of the doses of revefenacin comprising 88 mcg once daily and 175 mcg once daily, respectively.Earlier in July, the company had announced positive data from the 12-month safety study. Findings from the study demonstrated that both the doses of revefenacin were generally well-tolerated with low rates of adverse events and serious adverse events, respectively.Significantly, the company initiated a phase IIIb study, evaluating revefenacin on patients with low peak inspiratory flow rate in March 2017. Data from the study is expected in early 2018.Per the company’s press release, COPD is the third leading cause for death in the United States. The grim picture suggests that while 12.7 million Americans are diagnosed with the disease, almost an equal number of patients remain undiagnosed. An approval will be a huge boost as patients who prefer nebulized therapy, have no access to a nebulized LAMA. Hence, there is a large commercial countrywide opportunity for revefenacin in the COPD area.Theravance Biopharma, Inc. Price Theravance Biopharma, Inc. Price | Theravance Biopharma, Inc.

1303,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) reported disappointing third-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales missed estimates due to lower EpiPen sales.The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 and was down from $1.38 reported in the year-ago quarter.Third-quarter revenues of $2.98 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08 billion and were down 2% from the year-ago quarter. Mylan’s stock has tumbled 6.3% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 30.5%.Quarter in DetailThe company report results in three segments on a geographic basis — North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment third party net sales came in at $1.17 billion, down 22% due to a decline in sales of existing products as a result of lower volume and pricing, partially offset by the contribution from new products. The generics business in North America experienced higher price erosion than previous quarters, including the impact of the loss of market exclusivity of armodafinil. Sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector plunged significantly (a decline of $245.1 million) as a result of the impact of the launch of the authorized generic and higher governmental rebates.Third party net sales from Europe were $1.04 billion, up 24% propelled by the acquisition of Meda, new product introductions and favorable volume and pricing on existing products. Favorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 5% within Europe.Rest of World segment third party net sales of $743.3 million was up 9% fueled by the Meda acquisition. Sales also benefited by new products and increased net sales in emerging markets, which were driven primarily by higher volumes which were partially offset by lower pricing and volumes on existing products from anti-retroviral franchise, including active pharmaceutical ingredients. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 1%.Adjusted gross margin declined to 53% from 57% in the year-ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, partially offset by the contributions from the acquired businesses.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. Quote2017 Outlook UpdatedMylan raised the lower end of sales guidance due to the launch of the generic version of Copaxone. The company now expects revenues of $11.75-$12.5 billion in 2017, up from the earlier projection of $11.5-$12.5 billion. The company now projects earnings per share in the range of $4.45-$4.70, up from the previous projected range of $4.30-$4.70.We note that Mylan has already won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity.Our TakeMylan’s third-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America. The quarter experienced an accelerated decline in EpiPen sales due to the launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market.The company earlier suffered a few setbacks. Mylan received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its abbreviated new drug application ANDA for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s GSK  asthma drug Advair Diskus and is working to address the issues. The FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee unanimously recommended the approval of biosimilar version of Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin. However, the anticipated FDA goal date set under the Biosimilar User Fee Act was deferred to December from September 2017.Zacks RankMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1304,MYL,"We’ve got another busy week in store: more Q3 earnings and economic data, Republicans in U.S. Congress get busy working through the details of its massive tax reform program and the arrest in Saudi Arabia of a man known as “the Warren Buffett of the Middle East” are all grabbing headlines this morning. And we also see what appears to be a hostile bid by Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) to take over Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share, or $130 billion, including $60 billion in cash and Qualcomm debt.Should this merger deal be accepted, it would be the largest pure-tech deal in history, which would be accretive to Broadcom after the first year of the merge. But odds are very good Qualcomm will reject this proposal; though the company has acknowledged it has received the offer but given no indications that its board will find the terms favorable. Considering Qualcomm’s recent difficulties as a supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) products, some may see this as Broadcom moving at a very advantageous time.Reports this morning are that Qualcomm officials are openly questioning the initial asking price, as well as antitrust issues, in what is understood to be an initially negative reaction. And would Apple’s involvement — behind the scenes, perhaps — somehow manage to facilitate this deal down the road in a way that puts Qualcomm’s issues with Apple behind them? One thing is for sure: this is a discussion just warming up; we expect to hear much more about this proposed deal throughout the rest of this week and beyond.Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, reportedly facing money laundering charges following a corruption purge by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, may cause some ripples through the U.S. markets this morning — especially in two of al-Waleed’s major holdings, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Questions regarding Middle Eastern countries surrounding and necessarily affected by the crown prince’s moves, such as rival major power in the region, Iran, and Lebanon, which has had its own issues with stability at the top recesses of government.Futures in U.S. markets are so far shaking all of this off. We are in the green again this morning, following 8 straight weeks of an up-market. As we’ve discussed before here and elsewhere, at least some of this positive sentiment is a result of hopefulness that corporate tax cuts will create new windfalls for companies and their shareholders, perhaps even before the year is out.Q3 Earnings UpdateCVS Pharmacy (CVS  -  Free Report) beat estimates by a penny to $1.50 per share this morning, on in-line quarterly sales of $46.18 billion. Earnings are down year over year, but revenues were up 3.5%. CVS also upped its earnings guidance for full-year 2017.Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.33 per share easily surpassing the 83 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 37% year over year. Fiscal Q2 2018 sales of $1.147 billion topped the $1.046 billion we had been expecting. Guidance for both fiscal Q3 and full-year 2018, on both top and bottom lines, were also raised.Mylan Pharma (MYL  -  Free Report), however, missed expectations on both earnings and revenues, with $1.10 per share short of the $1.22 we were looking for, and $3.0 billion in sales beneath the $3.08 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Weaker-than-expected performance in North America, underscored by a fall in EpiPen sales in the quarter, were cited in the company’s report.

1307,MYL,"Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 6.Last quarter, the company missed expectations by 16%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.  Horizon Pharma’s shares have declined 12% in the year so far, underperforming the industry’s gain of 0.9%.Factors Likely to Impact This QuarterConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings, the company raised its outlook for 2017 and now expects sales in the range of $1.010-$1.045 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $985-$1.020 billion.Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one of its key growth drivers, Krystexxa, and projects peak sales of around $400 million in 2017 driven by higher demand. The guidance includes assumption of lower net average net realized price from the U.S. Government's Health Resource and Services Administration's Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price implementation scheduled for Oct 1. The company expects continued double-digit net sales growth for Ravicti in 2017, with room for additional uptake due to the recent label expansion. The drug is also expected to be launched in Europe in the second half. However, sales of Procysbi will decline due to the divestiture of European rights. Sales of Actimmune are projected to grow in low single-digits driven by a year-over-year growth in the second half.Meanwhile, Horizon Pharma’s primary care business is under pressure due to the implementation of a new commercial model, where the company is teaming up with pharmacy benefit managers and payers to help patients obtain access to its medicines.During the third-quarter earnings call, focus will be on the performance of the business units, along with that of products like Actimmune and Krystexxa.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Horizon Pharma is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -8.48%.

1308,MYL,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 2.Quanta Services has had a dismal earnings surprise history, with three misses and one in-line earnings over the trailing four quarters, for an average negative surprise of 4.5%. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.4%.However, we expect Quanta Services to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Quanta Services has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 60 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsQuanta Services has been deriving sturdy benefits from the company’s diligent three-pronged growth strategy. The strategy focuses on the timely delivery of projects, leveraging on its core business areas to expand in complementary service lines and venturing into new service lines as well.Quanta Services’ thriving engineering and project management services are anticipated to bolster its revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Of late, the company has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets, on the back of key growth drivers, like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and implementation of clean energy initiatives. These factors will likely boost the segment’s top line.Moreover, the company is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, amid substantial bidding activity, in Australia, Canada and the United States, which would reflect in the upcoming quarterly results. Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteQuanta Services raised its 2017 earnings and revenues guidance last quarter, and we believe its optimism stems from healthy backlog levels, which are anticipated to benefit the results in the to-be-reported quarter. Upbeat industry trends will act as major growth catalysts for the quarter to be reported.This apart, the company is likely to benefit directly from increasing U.S. production of liquid fuels. Also, Quanta Services wins more construction and engineering contracts as the performance and production levels of the energy sector increase. Robust pipeline projects in the oil and gas sector, supported by active bidding and negotiating environment, can also act as huge profit churners for the top line in the third quarter.In addition, Quanta Services’ previously completed acquisitions are likely to contribute significantly to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment’s top line. Particularly, the recent Stronghold acquisition will drive the company’s revenues with increased penetration in downstream and midstream petrochemical markets, which, in turn, will be beneficial for the quarter under review.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.69% and a Zacks Rank of 1, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 7.

1309,MYL,"Premier waste management firm Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 2. The company is likely to report higher revenues from the Collection segment that accounts for more than 73% of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.Whether this will lead to higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementRepublic Services has significantly expanded its product offerings in the e-commerce platform to address the evolving needs of the customers. This low-cost sales channel is likely to aid the company in the quarter. In addition, the company improved the capabilities and functionality of the customer portal and mobile app. These value-driven interactive features are likely to lead to incremental orders and higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.At the same time, Republic Services is focused on increasing operational efficiency by converting its fleet to compressed natural gas collection vehicles and modifying rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will reduce costs and improve profitability. The company is realigning its field support functions by combining two organizational layers. It expects these initiatives to contribute approximately $25 million of annual cost savings from 2018. As part of the realignment program, the company centralized the management structure for recycling operations. The new organizational structure is likely to ensure a clear ownership for the recycling and processing market vertical. Republic Services is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy ROI (return on investments).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Collection segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,883 million, up from $1,814 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Landfill segment are expected to be $318 million compared with reported revenues of $293 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues from the Transfer and Disposal Services segment are anticipated to be $136 million, up from $126 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, margin pressure remains a bottleneck for the company. Margins are expected to remain constrained in the impending quarter as Republic Services has more exposure to Collection services and less to Disposal services. Typically, Disposal services generate the highest margins and Collection services generate the lowest. The company’s performance is also likely to be hurt by protracted weakness in special waste, industrial volumes and tight municipal budgets. In addition, increased competitive pressure remains a concern for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Republic Services is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

1310,MYL,"Information technology services provider Gartner, Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 2. The company is likely to report higher revenues in Research segment that accounts for more than 72% of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.Whether this could result in higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementWith diligent execution of operational plans, Gartner has recorded double-digit growth in key metrics for more than a decade. In addition, this performance-driven firm has a strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet position. It has a vast, untapped market opportunity worth an estimated $61 billion. The acquisition of CEB, an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights, further reinforces Gartner’s market strength. The combination of its analyst-driven, syndicated research and advisory services with CEB’s expertise is likely to provide a comprehensive and differentiated suite of services portfolio across the globe.Gartner has a recurring revenue stream with 75% of its total revenues generated through subscription and long-term contracts. In addition, the company has a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration that mitigates operating risks. Operating in an industry with low barriers to entry, Gartner has an integrated research and consulting team designed to best serve client needs. This enables it to have a competitive advantage against its rivals. Leveraging its intellectual capital, Gartner creates and distributes proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and events. These facilitate a steadily improvement in the company’s revenue stream.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Research segment revenues is currently pegged at $687 million, up from $462 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Event segment are expected to be $38 million compared with reported revenues of $33 million in the year-earlier quarter. However, revenues from the Consulting segment are anticipated to be $75 million, down from $79 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Other Key FactorsGartner is relatively immune to the vagaries of the market due to secular growth of information technology spend and its increasing market penetration rate. However, some of its services are cyclically sensitive. In addition, revenues from the federal government business are exposed to lengthy approval times and other austerity measures, which often increase operating risks. These factors undermine the long-term growth potential of the company to some extent.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Gartner is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1311,MYL,"Major pharma companies like Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) and Novartis (Read more: Novartis Q3 Earnings & Sales Top on New Drugs Strength) reported third quarter results this week. While it was a “beat and raise” quarter for Lilly, Bristol-Myers’s results were mixed.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly Tops Expectations, Mulls Options for Animal Health Segment: Lilly’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both the top- and bottom-line and raising its outlook for the year reflecting uptake trends for new pharmaceutical products.The company also announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Animal Health business (Elanco Animal Health) with an update expected by mid-2018. The company is weighing options like an initial public offering, merger, sale, or retention of the business. The segment brought in revenues of $2.3 billion so far in 2017 (Read more: Lilly Beats on Q3 Earnings, Explores Sale of Elanco). Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mixed Quarter for BMY: It was a mixed quarter for Bristol-Myers with the company missing on earnings but surpassing revenue expectations. Opdivo’s performance remained strong despite the presence of increasing competition with sales growing 38% to $1.3 billion. Eliquis also performed well. The company said that business development remains a top priority while it expects to buy back shares worth an additional $250 million by year end (Read more: Bristol-Myers Misses on Q3 Earnings, Opdivo in Focus). The company has gained 4.3% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi Files Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Mylan for Lantus: French drugmaker, Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) has filed a patent infringement suit against Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) for Lantus and Lantus SoloStar. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges infringement of 18 patents. Although Sanofi’s diabetes product sales are under immense pressure, the Lantus franchise remains a major contributor to the top-line. Earlier this year in August, Sanofi had filed a patent infringement suit against Merck alleging infringement of two patents related to Lantus products.Interest Increases in Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare Business: Ever since Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it is exploring strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, including a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale, quite a few companies have been rumored to be interested in striking a deal. This week, British pharma major, Glaxo, was asked on its third quarter call about its interest in acquiring Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business.  Glaxo’s own Consumer segment has been witnessing a material slowdown in global growth across key categories with factors like pricing pressure, increasing competition and tougher emerging markets weighing on performance (Read more: Glaxo Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues In Line, Shares Down).Meanwhile, according to a Reuters article, Pfizer expects to start the auction process for its consumer healthcare business in November. According to sources, possible bidders apart from Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser could include names like Procter & Gamble, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Nestle.PerformanceThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 3.7% this week. Among major stocks, Glaxo declined 10.9% mainly reflecting concerns about the company’s dividend payouts especially if it strikes a deal for Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business. Over the last six months, J&J was up 16.3% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Beat & Raise Quarter from J&J, Allergan Hit by Restasis Ruling).What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for earnings results from companies like Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1312,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 85 cents per American depositary share in the third quarter of 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. The bottom line was, however, flat at constant exchange rates (CER).Glaxo’s shares dropped more than 2% in after-hours trading. At the third-quarter conference call, Glaxo showed an interest to purchase Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) consumer healthcare business, which the latter plans to put up on sales. However, Glaxo’s interest in buying Pfizer’s unit raised investor’s concerns about the acquirer possibly sacrificing a portion of its dividend payment due to the potential buyout. So far this year, the stock has lost 3.2% against the industry’s 17.8% increase. Quarterly revenues were up 2% at CER to $10.2 billion (£7.8 billion) on the back of strong performances mainly in the Pharmaceuticals segments. However, revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 4% in the United States and 1% in International markets. On the other hand, sales in Europe registered a decrease of 2%.Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products surged 40%, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq; respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala; and vaccines to prevent meningitis, Bexsero and Menveo.Glaxo reports results under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered revenue growth of 2%, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq, and respiratory disease drugs, Relvar/Breo and Nucala. This upside was partly offset by the impact of recent divestments.HIV sales rallied 13% on the back of 18% growth in the United States and 24% in International sales. Europe sales were however, down 1% year over year. Otherwise, the encouraging numbers came on the back of continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 29%) and Tivicay (sales up 41%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 65% due to an increased generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Respiratory sales were flat at CER. In both United States and Europe, sales dipped 1%. However, in International markets, the same increased 3%. This downside was mainly due to a continued transition to newer products in the portfolio.Sales of new respiratory products like Relvar/Breo Ellipta, Anoro Ellipta, Arnuity Ellipta and Nucala were offset by lower sales of Seretide/Advair sales (down 15%). Flixotide/Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 22% and 13%, respectively.The Ellipta products recorded a 54% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing.Immuno-inflammation drugs, which include Benlysta, rose 24% in the quarter.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals includes the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology (CVMU) and other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales declined 4% in the quarter.Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment went up, despite a slowdown in market conditions. The power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories, saw a strong performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were flat at CER. Geographically, the United States and Europe were up 6%, whereas international markets dropped 14%. While meningitis vaccines — Bexsero, in the United States and Europe whereas Menveo in the United States — saw higher sales, the same was offset by a weak performance of the Established Vaccines, driven by increasing competitive pressures on Infanrix, Pediarix in the United States and Europe.Notably, in October, Glaxo announced that the FDA has granted an approval to its vaccine, Shingrix, for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). Subsequently, during the same month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted in favor of three recommendations for the use of Shingrix. The vaccine is preferred over Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax.OutlookThe company expects to face a generic competition for Advair in the United States next year, which will affect the top line. However, there is uncertainty regarding the timing of launch of a generic version of the drug. With no generic version of Advair expected to be unveiled in 2017, the company continues to expect core 2017 earnings growth in the range of 3-5% at CER.We remind investors that Mylan's (MYL  -  Free Report) efforts to bring a generic version of Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Advair in April, thereby delaying the entry of the generic. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’s generic version of Advair was also denied an approval by the FDA in May. The drug’s generic version is therefore not likely to be approved this year.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1313,MYL,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, Allergan’s second bestselling drug. This potentially opens the doors for early generic competition. Shares of the company fell almost 3.5% in response on Monday.The company is disappointed with the court’s ruling and is planning to appeal against it. However, if this ruling is upheld even after the appeal, it will negatively impact Restasis sales. The invalidated patents —‘111, ‘048, ‘930 and ‘191 — which are listed in the Orange Book were set to expire in Aug 27, 2024.Restasis is approved for the treatment of chronic dry eye.Allegan’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. While the company’s stock fell 5.6%, the industry was down 23.5% in that period.In 2015, Allergan had filed patent infringement lawsuits against a group of generic drug manufacturers which include Teva Pharma (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) among others. The companies are seeking approval for generic versions of Restasis in the United States. Meanwhile, last week, Allergan settled with InnoPharma, granting the latter the right to market generic Restasis beginning Feb 24, 2024.Moreover, in a bid to dismiss inter partes review for Restasis, Allergan signed an agreement last month with Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, to gain sovereign immunity. However, court litigation is out of the purview of sovereign immunity. This unconventional move by the company has been questioned by many lawmakers and was criticized by generic manufacturers. Such deals to gain sovereign immunity will make the launch of generics a lengthy and complex legal process, curbing competition.Restasis generated $676.4 million in sales worldwide in the first the six months of 2017. The FDA’s approval to Shire PLC’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) Xiidra last year has already increased competition for the drug. Any earlier-than-expected generic entry following the invalidation of these patents will further increase competition.Allergan PLC. Price and Consensus  Allergan PLC.

1315,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) suffered a setback following the FDA’s Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the company´s Biologics License Application (BLA) for MYL-1401H, a proposed biosimilar of Amgen’s Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta.The CRL relates to the pending update of the BLA with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.However, the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity.Mylan is exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. A partnership with Biocon, and additional collaborations has helped Mylan develop a wide portfolio of biosimilar/insulin analog generic products, representing a total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales.Earlier, the FDA notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017. A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the review period was extended due to some of the clarificatory information that were needed to be submitted to the agency as part of the process.Last week the FDA approved the generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) 40 mg/mL (thrice weekly).  The news boosted investors’ sentiment and the company’s shares surged on the same. Mylan’s stock has increased 1.1% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 17.4%.Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. The FDA also approved a generic for Copaxone 20 mg/mL once-daily. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. According to QuintilesIMS, sales of Copaxone 20mg/mL dose was approximately $700 million and $3.64 billion for the 40 mg/mL dose for the 12 months period ending July 31, 2017.

1316,MYL,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen Biotech announced that the FDA has approved its new drug application (NDA) for apalutamide for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Apalutamide, J&J’s next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor, will be marketed under the trade name of Erleada.The FDA decision comes much earlier than expected. Please note that in December last year, the NDA was granted priority review by the FDA. With the FDA granting priority review, a response was expected in April 2018.Erleada’s NDA submission was based on positive data from the phase III SPARTAN study.Last week, J&J presented positive data from the SPARTAN study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium meeting. The data from the study showed that Erleada (apalutamide) significantly reduced the risk of metastatis or death by 72% and increased median metastatis-free survival by more than two years in patients with nmCRPC.J&J stock has returned 11.2% in the past year, which compares favorably with a gain of 10.6% recorded by the industry.Given that there are no FDA-approved treatments available for this patient population, Erleada’s approval is a significant boost for the company’s cancer portfolio.Also, Erleada’s approval has strengthened J&J’s prostate cancer franchise, especially with key drug Zytiga, approved for treating metastatic CRPC, facing patent challenges.Several companies like Amneal, Apotex, Dr. Reddy’s (RDY  -  Free Report), Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) among others are looking for an FDA approval of their generic versions of Zytiga.Last month, J&J announced that the U.S. PTO issued a final written decision in an inter parties review (IPR) by a generic manufacturer, invalidating J&J’s ‘438  patent for Zytiga.Zytiga was a key driver of revenue growth at J&J last year. Zytiga sales rose 10.8% to $2.5 billion in 2017 due to improved market share in a growing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market.Though J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga this year, it is confident that its guidance for 2017 organic sales growth (of 2.5%-3.5%) can absorb the impact of any potential Zytiga headwind such as an earlier-than-expected generics launch in 2018. In addition, Erleada’s early approval can somewhat make up for any lost sales of Zytiga in case a generic is launched this year.Apalutamide was added to J&J’s portfolio through the August 2012 Aragon acquisition.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus  Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson Quote(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

1318,MYL,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) were down around 4% on Tuesday, as another generic version of its blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection, Copaxone was launched earlier than expected.Sandoz - Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm – announced the FDA approval and launch of Glatopa 40 mg/ml, its generic version of 40 mg formulation of Copaxone. This will be the second generic version of the 40 mg formulation of Copaxone. The launch came much earlier-than-expected. Teva, on its fourth quarter conference call held last week, had said that the second generic version of the 40 mg formulation was likely to be launched in April this year.The first generic version of Copaxone 40 mg was launched by Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) in October last year, also much earlier than expected, which dealt a major blow to Teva. Also at the same time, Mylan launched the second biosimilar version of the 20 mg formulation. Please note that the first generic version of Copaxone 20 mg has been marketed by Momenta (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz since 2015.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales witnessed rapid erosion.Now, with the launch of the second generic version of the 40 mg formulation, sales are expected to decline further.In 2017, Copaxone sales totaled $3.8 billion, down almost 10% from 2016 levels. For 2018, Teva estimates Copaxone sales to fall to $1.8 billion as the Copaxone franchise continues to erode. In fact, Teva issued a weak outlook for 2018 wherein it expects sales and profits to decline further this year.The Israel-based generic drugmaker had a tough 2017 as it faced significant challenges in the form of accelerated generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load of more than $32 billion. Mylan’s earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva.Teva divested some non-core assets, mainly in the Women’s Health business, to cut its significant debt load.

1319,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported another disappointing quarter last week. Its fourth-quarter earnings declined 32% year over year, while sales were down 16%.The Israel-based company’s product sales in 2017 were hurt by increased pricing erosion, volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit and rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone -- Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection -- in the Specialty segment. Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva. The company is also bogged down by new competition for branded products and huge debt burden of over $32 billion.On the fourth-quarter call, Teva provided a weak guidance for 2018 wherein it expects sales and profits to decline further this year.Teva expects revenues in the range of $18.3 - $18.8 billion while earnings are expected in the band of $2.25–$2.50 per share in 2018. The numbers fell below investors’ expectations.However, Teva has undertaken strategic restructuring efforts including the divestiture of some non-core assets,closure of plants, trimming of its generics portfolio, termination of low-value R&D projects, and plans to reduce its workforce by more than a quarter over the next two years.Although the company expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019 from these restructuring initiatives, a clear path to growth is not visible as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone. Other than that, loss of sales due to divestures and pricing pressure in the U.S. generic business will continue to hurt the top line in 2018.In fact, price erosion and several other challenges cast a shadow over the whole generic drug industry.Generic Drug Industry in DoldrumsGeneric Drugs has a Zacks Industry Rank #176 (bottom 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). The industry has declined 32.6% in the past year, underperforming an increase of 2.4% for the broader drugs industry and 14.6% for the S&P 500.The generics industry in the United States faced significant competitive and pricing pressure in 2017 and the trend is expected to continue in 2018. Moreover, customers in the industry are consolidating thereby increasing the scope for negotiating lower prices for generic drugs. This is leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume.A sharp decline in generic drug prices is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs, which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume.3 Stocks to DumpWith generic pricing erosion expected to continue this year, we recommend investors to dump three companies in this industry, including Teva.TevaTeva has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Following its unimpressive fourth-quarter results and trimmed view for 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings declined from $2.93 to $2.91 over the last seven days. Teva has lost 43.4% of its value in the past year.Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY  -  Free Report)This India-based generic drugmaker has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Like its larger peers, Dr Reddy’s also suffers from drug price erosion, fierce competitive pressure and lower contribution from product launches in the United States. In addition, the implementation of general sales tax (""GST"") in India is also hurting its top line to an extent.However, the company has launched several generics of various drugs including Sanofi’s billion dollar drug, Renvela. These launches may have a favorable impact as the company’s generics sales have registered sequential growth in the quarter ending December 2017.Dr Reddy’s earnings estimates for 2018 have declined almost 6.1% over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 22.6% in the past year.Teligent (TLGT  -  Free Report)Teligent is a small pharmaceutical company with 21 generic and four branded products in its portfolio. The company has also suffered due to the generic market headwinds. Moreover, product launches have not been able to make up for the loss due to pricing pressure for the company’s two leading products.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales and earnings are expected to decline 24.5% and 1200%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Teligent also carries a Zacks Rank #4. Shares of the company have tumbled 58.5% in the past year.ConclusionGeneric companies at large are seeing declining sales and profits due to price erosion. However, there are a few exceptions, Mylan being one of them. Though Mylan stock declined in the first half of 2017, shares rebounded from August 2017, outperforming the industry. The stock has gained 4.2% since August.Mylan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its earnings estimates for 2018 have risen 1.1% over the past 90 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mylan’s turnaround was driven by launch of generic versions of several drugs including blockbuster drugs, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Gleevec and Teva’s Copaxone, in the second half of 2017. Moreover, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Appeal Board instituted inter partes review proceedings ontwo patents related to Sanofi’s Lantus. A favorable ruling will boost Mylan’s prospect as Lantus is a blockbuster drug with sales over $4 billion in the first nine months of 2017. The potential launch of a generic version by Mylan will significantly boost its top line.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1320,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 93 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share and came ahead of the guided range of 70 cents-80 cents. However, earnings per share declined 32% year over year.Revenues were $5.46 billion, which marginally beat the consensus estimate of $5.42 billion. However, sales declined 16% year over year (down 12% excluding impact of currency).Sales were hurt by increased pricing erosion and volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit and rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone - Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection - in the Specialty segment.Segment DiscussionTeva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition. The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business.Generic Medicines segment revenues were $3.1 billion, down 16% year over year.Revenues from the U.S. generics business declined 15% to $1.2 billion due to significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, increased competition for Concerta authorized generic, and stringent government regulations also hurt sales.European generic revenues were $1.1 billion, flat year over year. However, sales declined 8% in local currency terms from the year-ago period mainly due to absence of revenues from the generic business of Actavis in the United Kingdom, which was divested in January 2017.Rest of the world (ROW) generic revenues declined 31% to $864 million in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales rose 2% mainly due to higher sales in Russia and Israel.API revenues were flat at $181 million. OTC revenues were down 46% to $217 million (up 9% in local currency terms).Specialty Medicines revenues were $1.8 billion, down 19% from the year-ago period due to lower sales of its central nervous system (CNS) products and divesture of some non-core assets in the Women’s Health business. Among Teva’s various therapeutic areas, CNS sales declined 21% to $984 million due to lower sales of Copaxone.Sales of respiratory products declined 10% to $293 million, oncology product sales rose 6% to $283 million, and women’s health business recorded a 44% decrease in revenues to $68 million. Other specialty revenues declined 32% to $167 million.Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 19% to $821 million mainly due to lower sales in the United States. Sales declined 25% in the United States to $622 million mainly due to the generic competition, which resulted in higher rebates and lower volumes.Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz - Novartis’ generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation is expected to be launched in April this year.Ex-U.S. sales of Copaxone were flat on a local currency basis at $199 million.Among other products, Azilect sales declined 55% to $40 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the United States in 2017. ProAir declined 27% to $102 million and QVAR declined 47% to $61 million, both hurt by negative net pricing effects. Combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues rose 5% to $157 millionThe Other segment (distribution and other activities) recorded revenues of $550 million, down 4% year over year as the company sold-off some distribution businesses.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 720 basis points (bps) to 52.2% in the quarter. Research & development expenses declined almost 40% from the year-ago period to $310 million. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 28% from the year-ago level to $791 million. Adjusted operating income declined 29% to $1.4 billion in the quarter despite lower costs.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $22.4 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion and also came ahead of the guided range of $22.2 - $22.3 billion. Sales rose 2% year over year, gaining from the inclusion of Actavis Generics revenues.Teva acquired Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics segment, Actavis Generics and also its U.S. generic distribution business, Anda, in 2016Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $4.01 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.84 per share and exceeded the guided range of $3.77–$3.88 per share. Earnings declined 22% year over year.2018 Outlook Below ExpectationsTeva expects revenues in the range of $18.3 - $18.8 billion, which fell short of the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.17 billion. The company expects earnings in the band of $2.25–$2.50 per share in 2018, also short of the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93 per share.In 2018, Teva expects Copaxone to generate sales of $1.8 billion globally, significantly lower than $3.8 billion in 2017 as the franchise continues to erode.U.S. Generics sales are expected to decline roughly 20% from 2017 levels to approximately $4 billion in 2018 hurt by ongoing price erosion and generic Concerta. Also, ProAir franchise is expected to see generic competition during the second half of 2018.Costs are expected to decline $1.8 billion in 2018.Our TakeThough Teva beat expectations for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, its stock crashed more than 10% on Thursday, as the company issued a weak outlook for 2018, wherein it expects sales and profits to decline further this year.Teva’s shares have slumped 42.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 29.3%.The Israel-based generic drug maker had a tough 2017 as it faced significant challenges in the form of accelerated generic competition for Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load of more than $32 billion.  Mylan’s earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva.Teva divested some non-core assets (mainly in the Women’s Health business) to cut its significant debt load. The company also has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December. Though the company expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019from these restructuring initiatives, a clear path to growth is not visible.These efforts might not be enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone. Other than that, divestures and pricing pressure in the U.S. generic business will continue to hurt the top line in 2018.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1321,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 72 cents per American depositary share in the fourth quarter of 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. The bottom line was up 11% at constant exchange rate (CER) compared with the year-ago figure.Glaxo’s shares have lost 9.4% in a year’s time against the industry’s 14.1% increase. Quarterly revenues rose 4% at CER to $10.3 billion (£7.6 billion), driven by strong segmental performances in Consumer Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines. The top line also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.9 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 4% in the United States and 7% in the International markets. On the flip side, sales in Europe were flat year over year.Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products surged 51%, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq; respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala; and the meningitis preventive vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo.Glaxo reports financial figures under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered 3% revenue growth, driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq and respiratory disease drugs, Relvar/Breo and Nucala. This upside was but partly offset by the impact of recent divestments and a sales decrease of older respiratory products including Seretide/Advair and Established Pharmaceuticals.HIV sales increased 17% on the back of 19% and 28% growth in the United States and International sales, respectively. Europe sales were also up 7% year over year. The encouraging numbers were driven by continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 27%) and Tivicay (sales up 41%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 61% due to an increased generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Notably, the company’s latest product from the HIV portfolio is Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine), the first two-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV. It was approved in the United States in November 2017. The drug generated initial sales of £5 million during the quarter. However, this week, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) has announced an FDA approval of its triple combination, once-daily single tablet regimen, Biktarvy (bictegravir /emtricitabine /tenofovir alafenamide), for HIV-1 infection treatment. This approval might pose competitive threats to Juluca in the coming quarters.Respiratory sales were up 2% at CER. In the EU and the International markets, sales increased 4% and 6%, respectively. However, in the United States, the metric was flat year over year. The sales improvement was mainly driven by the new respiratory products sales growth, partially offset by the sales decline of older products like Seretide/Advair, Flovent and Ventolin.Notably, the recently launched respiratory product, Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD), has generated initial sales of $2 million in the United States and the EU during the reported quarter.The Ellipta products recorded a 53% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing. However, this upside was offset by lower sales of Seretide/Advair (down 14%). Flixotide/Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 12% and 9%, respectively.Immuno-inflammation drugs, including Benlysta, rose 15% in the quarter.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals comprises the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology (CVMU) and other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales declined 5% in the quarter under review.Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment climbed 4%, despite a slowdown in market conditions. The power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories, saw a sturdy performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive, having increased 9% year over year. Geographically, the United States, Europe and the international markets increased 16%, 2% and 9%, respectively. While meningitis vaccines — Bexsero — decreased 5% in the United States, the same increased 15% in the Europe market. While Menveo in the United States posted higher sales, the same was offset by a weak performance of the Established Vaccines due to increasing competitive pressures on Infanrix and Pediarix in the United States and Europe.It is important to note that in October 2017, the FDA granted an approval to Glaxo’s shingles vaccine, Shingrix. Later in the same month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of three recommendations for the use of Shingrix. The vaccine is preferred over Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax. Owing to this favorable recommendation, Shingrix generated initial sales of £22 million in the United States during the period under discussion.2017 ResultsFull-year sales gained 3% year over year to $39.3 billion (£30.2 billion). However, the metric marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.5 billion.The 2017 earnings of $2.9 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The full-year bottom line reflects 4% growth compared with the year-ago figure. Moreover, reported earnings matched the previously announced guidance for 2017.2018 OutlookThe company stated that EPS growth for 2018 is uncertain due to the timing of the entry of Advair generics in the market. Hence, it issued two sets of guidance for 2018.The company expects 4-7% EPS growth at CER in 2018, if no Advair generics are launched further this year. However, in the probable event of introducing Advair generics in the U.S. market by mid-2018, Glaxo anticipates adjusted EPS to be flat to down 3% year over year at CER.Three companies Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Novartis which are trying to bring a generic version of Advair in the market received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA. While, Mylan and Hikma received CRL last year, Novartis received the same this week delaying the entry of generics in the U.S. market.Long-term GuidanceThe company projects its EPS to witness a CAGR in the mid-to-high-single-digit range through 2020.While the Vaccine segment is estimated to register a mid-to-high-single-digit growth through 2020 despite competition for pediatric and flu vaccines, the Consumer Healthcare segment is expected to deliver low-to-mid-single-digit top-line CAGR through 2020.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC Quote Zacks RankGlaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1322,MYL,"Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $4.86 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 by 2.5%. Earnings rose 24.6% year over year driven by higher revenues and lower R&D costs.Revenues came in at $4.33 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.28 billion by 1.2%. Revenues rose 12% from the year-ago period.Key products like Botox and Juvéderm collection of fillers and new products like Vraylar, Viberzi and Namzaric did well in the quarter. However, sales erosion of Namenda XR and Aczone and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin, hurt the top line.Fourth-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April 2017) acquisitionsSegment DiscussionThe company reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International.U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 19.8% to $1.88 billion driven by continued strong performance of its facial aesthetics products, Botox and Juvéderm Collection of fillers.Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $228.4 million (up 14.5%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $367.2 million, up 17.1%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 14.7% to $139.5 million. In Eye Care, Ozurdex sales increased 16.8% to $26.4 million while blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis’ sales rose 1.8% to $400.3 million. In Plastic Surgery, breast implants sales increased 21.5%, which contributed to the upside. In Medical Dermatology, Aczone sales declined 37.9% in the quarter to $38 million.LifeCell’s Alloderm added $97.9 million while ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting business added $94.4 million to sales in the fourth quarter.U.S. General Medicine net revenues were flat at $1.5 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands and Women's Health franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 14.8% to $66.6 million, Gastrointestinal rose 2% to $453.2 million and Central Nervous System sales rose 2.9% to $349 million.Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric, Viberzi and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 12.2% in the quarter to $194.8 million, driven by strong demand. Lo Loestrin sales rose 17.7% to $126.5 million backed by strong demand trends and higher selling prices.Among the newer products, Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $36.8 million, almost flat with $37 million in the previous quarter. Viberzi recorded sales of $42.9 million, up 12.9% driven by higher selling prices.Namenda XR sales declined 30.7% to $97.8 million in the quarter due to lower demand and generic pressure.Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 32% to $42.8 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol.In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 93.2% to $5.3 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in March last year.The International segment recorded net revenues of $915.9 million, up 16.8% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Botox (therapeutic), Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting.SG&A Costs Rise, R&D DeclinesSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 6.2% to $1.13 billion in the quarter, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions. R&D expenses declined 4.7% to $405.7 million due to cost control and reprioritization of R&D programs.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $15.94 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.89 billion. Revenues were within the guidance of 15.875 billion to $16.025 billion. Sales rose 9.4% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $16.35 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.27 per share and were within the guided range of $16.15–$16.45. Earnings rose 21% year over year.2018 OutlookAllergan maintained its previously issued total sales guidance in the range of approximately $15.0 billion – $15.3 billion.Meanwhile, the company said that it expects adjusted earnings in the range of $15.25 - $16.00 per share in 2018. Last month, Allergan had said that it expected earnings of at least $15.25 per share in 2018.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14% in 2018.Migraine Candidate Succeeds in Phase III StudyAllergan announced that a phase III study evaluating its migraine candidate, ubrogepant met its co-primary endpoints. The ACHIEVE I study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant for treating a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity. The study data demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant, at both the doses (50 mg and 100 mg), were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients experienced absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo.Our TakeAllergan’s fourth-quarter results were strong as it beat expectations for both earnings and revenues on strong demand for its key drug, Botox. This, in addition to the positive top-line data from ubrogepant study, pushed up the share price by 1.2% in pre-market trading. However, in the past year, Allergan’s share price has declined 29.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 27.8%.Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Namenda XR and Restasis. While a generic version of Namenda XR is expected to be launched in early first quarter, a generic version of Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is expected to be launched in the second quarter. Also, in December 2017, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the first generic version for Estrace cream while a generic version of ulcerative colitis drug Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second quarter.Meanwhile, new competition for key growth drivers, Botox, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. In December, Revance Therapeutics’ next-generation neuromodulator, RT002 demonstrated substantial reduction in severity of glabellar lines in phase III studies with a longer duration of efficacy compared to the currently marketed neuromodulators including Botox. The product is being considered a potential threat to Botox, which is marketed for the same indication.Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in 2017 for chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Linzess.Nonetheless, Allergan’s products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar support sales growth. It also boasts a strong branded pipeline while biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. Also, last month, Allergan announced a cost-saving and restructuring program. Allergan is laying off over 1,000 employees to protect it from potential revenue declines.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Allergan PLC. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Allergan PLC.

1323,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings on Feb 8, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.76%.This generic drug maker’s shares have lost 40.1% in the past year, while the industry witnessed a decrease of 27.7%.Teva’s earnings have surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, met the same in one and missed expectations in the remaining two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.66%.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIncreased pricing erosion and volume declines in Teva’s U.S. Generics unit, ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment are hurting the company’s top line. We do not expect any improving trend in the fourth quarter.The U.S. generics industry is witnessing significant competitive and pricing pressure, thereby affecting the company’s top-line performance. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. Drug price erosion was 10% in the third quarter and management had warned on the call that the erosion will accelerate in the fourth quarter and beyond. Moreover, accelerated FDA approvals of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, lower-than-expected contribution of new generic launches and increased competition for its largest product - Concerta authorized generic – will also continue to hurt sales in the Generics unit.Meanwhile, in the Specialty segment, loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone, Azilect and Nuvigil will hurt sales.Sales of Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Copaxone should continue to erode due to generic competition. Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, has been on the market since June 2015. In October, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly. Teva had previously estimated a negative impact of at least 30 cents per share on fourth-quarter earnings.Meanwhile, a generic version of Azilect was launched in the United States in January 2017 and sales have started to decline sharply. ProAir also lost exclusivity in the United States in 2017 and its fourth-quarter sales are likely to be lower.To combat the rapid decline in sales, last month, Teva announced a restructuring plan that will see more than 25% of the company’s global workforce being laid off over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018. Though management then provided quite a few details on how the plan will be executed, we expect an update on the upcoming conference call. Also, in November, Teva had announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity that included the departure of heads of three divisions. The company had also said then that it will no longer have two separate global groups for its two businesses – generics and specialty medicines. Instead, Teva will now operate through three regions —North America, Europe and Growth Markets — which will include generics, specialty, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. An update on the progress made on the new strategy so far is expected on the call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -3.10% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 78 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 81 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Teva has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other drug/biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +8.92% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 8.Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (PBYI  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.02% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release results later this month.

1324,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the divestment of its global women’s health business to privately-held private equity firm, CVC Capital Partners. The deal was closed for $703 million in cash.The divested portfolio includes products across contraception, fertility, menopause and osteoporosis categories. The drugs in the portfolio include Ovaleap, Zoely, Seasonique, Colpotrophine and Actonel, which are sold outside the United States. These products will now be sold by Theramex, a women’s health unit previously held by Teva.The sale is part of Teva’s planned divestment of specialty products in women’s health.We remind investors that Teva had signed a definitive agreement for this sale with CVC Capital Partners in September 2017. Moreover, the company also signed another definitive agreement with Foundation Consumer Healthcare for the sale of its Plan B One-Step and brands of emergency contraception.CVC Capital Partners has appointed Anish Mehta, former head of International Business Development at Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), as Theramex’s chief executive officer.In a separate SEC filing, Teva reported that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Allergan, jointly dismissing the working capital dispute arbitration. Allergan will pay Teva $700 million as part of the settlement.Teva’s shares rose 3.8% on Feb 1, following the news. However, shares of the company have declined 38.5% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 24.9%. Teva’s decline can be attributed to industry pressure, generic competition for its blockbuster drug, Copaxone, and a massive debt load. Teva also suffered a another setback in October 2017 as Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its generic version of the 40 mg formulation of Copaxone, much earlier than expected.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTeva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Zoetis Inc.

1325,MYL,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA classified the outcome of fourth-quarter 2017 reinspection of Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) McPherson facility as Voluntary Action Indicated (“VAI”).Glatopa 20 mg/mL was approved by the FDA in 2015. Glatopa 20 mg/mL is the first ""AP"" rated, substitutable generic equivalent of once-daily Copaxone. The generic was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with Sandoz AG, or Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis Pharma AG (NVS  -  Free Report).Per the collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of Glatopa 20 mg/mL, and Momenta earns 50% of contractually-defined profits on the drug’s sales.Sandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (""ANDA"") for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.While the ANDA for Glatopa remains under regulatory review, Momenta believes that the application review could be completed at any time in connection with the change to the VAI status.  The news brought a breath of fresh air to investors and the company’s shares went up 5.2%. Momenta’s stock has lost 10.9% over a year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 10.5%.Nevertheless, with the announced change in compliance status for McPherson, Kansas facility amended to VAI, Momenta expects to gain marketing approval and subsequently launch Glatopa 40 mg in the first half of 2018.Momenta has had a rough time in 2017. Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) obtained FDA approval for a generic version of Copaxone 40 mg making it the first generic to be approved. This was a huge setback for Momenta. With Mylan launching both Copaxone 20mg and Copaxone 40mg product, the company expects revenues from Glatopa to be adversely impacted due to declines in both price and volume. Moreover, there will be additional pressure in the market for customers to switch from the 20mg product to the 40mg product.The company also suffered a blow in regard to the development of its biosimilar candidate, M834. The candidate did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to reference drug Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan will evaluate the next course of action.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1326,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that two phase III studies evaluating the subcutaneous formulation of its asthma injection, Cinqair (reslizumab) did not meet their primary endpoints.Cinqair is already available in the market in an intravenous formulation to treat patients with severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophils.The phase III registration study evaluated subcutaneously administered reslizumab at a fixed-dose of 110 mg in a pre-filled syringe in patients with uncontrolled asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. Top-line results from the study showed that reslizumab was unsuccessful in significantly reducing the frequency of clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs), thereby failing to meet the primary endpoint.The other phase III claim-support study evaluated the subcutaneous dosing option in patients with oral corticosteroid (OCS) - dependent asthma. Here too, reslizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint of reduction in daily OCS dose. Teva stated it will determine the subsequent course of action after a full review of the data.Teva’s shares have slumped 35.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 17.1%.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for its largest branded drug, Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which is hurting the company’s top line.Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone’s sales have been declining for quite some time now. In October, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015. Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly.Additionally, the company’s debt burden increased as a result of the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics in 2016. With nearly $35 billion in debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years. However, a clear path to growth is not visible. These efforts might not prove enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1327,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of Trisenox injection to include first-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (“APL”) patients in combination with tretinoin.The eligible APL patients should have t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR-alpha gene expression.Trisenox is currently approved for a similar indication in patients who are refractory/relapsed to retinoid and anthracycline chemotherapy.The drug is already approved in the EU as both first-line and second-line treatment for this indication.Teva’s shares have declined 35% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 19% in that period.According to the company, Trisenox, in combination with retinoic acid, can increase survival rates, dramatically reduce the risk of relapse, and help avoid chemotherapy-related side effects in low-to-intermediate risk APL patients. It has been seen in clinical studies that Trisenox, in combination with retinoic acid, can lead to a 99% overall survival rate with almost no relapse after more than four years (50 months) of median follow-up.Teva’s oncology portfolio includes five drugs, which performed well in the third quarter of 2017. It registered year-over-year growth of 12% to reach $302 million. The label expansion of Trisenox is expected to further boost the portfolio’s performance in the coming quarters.However, Teva is facing headwinds due to pricing pressure in the generics industry. Also, the approval of Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) generic version of its key drug, Copaxone, in October last year had a negative impact on its fourth quarter revenue guidance.Moreover, the Israeli firm is also facing a huge debt load, which swelled with the acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic division in 2016.In a bid to get rid of its problems, the company brought in a new chief executive officer (“CEO”), Kare Schultz, who had played an instrumental role in the turnaround of Denmark’s H. Lundbeck A/S, which was struggling with a string of losses. He also worked as the chief operating officer of another Denmark based drug giant, Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report).The new CEO announced restructuring plans in December 2017 in order to reduce cost and improve business performance, profitability, cash flow generation and productivity. Teva has announced to cut about 14,000 job cuts (more than 25% of the company’s global workforce) over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018. The company will also shut down many of its offices and R&D facilities around the globe and divest the assets. The moves are expected to reduce its $16.1 billion cost base (estimated for 2017) by $3 billion at the end of 2019.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks RankTeva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1328,MYL,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for 2018as it faces potential loss of exclusivity for some of its key products in 2018.Allergan expects total sales in the range of approximately $15.0 billion – $15.3 billion, which falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.76 billion. Meanwhile, the company said that it expects adjusted earnings of at least $15.25 per share. Though not directly comparable, the earnings projection also appears short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.98 per share.Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Alzheimer’s treatment, Namenda XR and blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis. In the latest press release, the company said that it expects a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched in early first quarter while that of Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is not expected to be launched prior to the second quarter.We remind investors that in October 2017, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis. The patent loss opened doors for early generic competition for Restasis whose patents were scheduled to expire in August 2024. Please note that no generic version of Restasis has been approved yet.We also remind investors that on the third-quarter earnings call, Allergan had said that if a generic version of Restasis is launched in mid 2018, adjusted earnings per share would be no less than $16. Also, the company said that if a generic enters the market on Jan 1, 2018, adjusted earnings per share will be more than $15 per share.Also, this year, Allergan faces loss of patent exclusivity for Estrace vaginal cream and ulcerative colitis drug, Delzicol. In December last year, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the first generic version for Estrace cream while a generic version of Delzicol is expected to be launched in early second quarter.Last week, Allergan, in a regulatory filing, announced that it is laying off over 1,000 employees as part of a cost-saving and restructuring program. In the latest press release, Allergan said its cost reduction efforts should reduce  operating  expenses  by  $300  million  to  $400  million  in  2018 from  2017.Also, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug, Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) was launched last year for chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Allergan’s, Linzess.In the past year, Allergan’s shares have declined 22.5% compared with the industry’sdecline of 25.5%.Allergan also provided some other updates along with issuing 2018 outlook. The company said that the impact of the tax reforms will be broadly neutral to its adjusted effective tax rate over time with a moderate increase in the 2018 rate from 2017 levels. Allergan guided an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% in 2018.Under the new $2 billion share buyback plan announced in September last year, Allergan said it has already bought back approximately 20% of the authorized amount in the three months ended December 2017. Also, the company said it plans to sell its remaining stake in Teva securities this year.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1329,MYL,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) reported positive top-line data on pipeline candidate, M281 from a phase I single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of normal human volunteers.The phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281.M281 is a fully human anti-neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) aglycosylated immunoglobulin G (IgG1) monoclonal antibody, engineered to reduce circulating pathogenic IgG antibodies, in excess of that achieved by any current treatments, by completely blocking endogenous IgG recycling via FcRn.The candidate did not exhibit any adverse event, was well tolerated, and decreased circulating IgG levels up to 89% with a mean reduction of 84% over the 98-day MAD study. In addition, the SAD portion of the study enrolled five cohorts with a total of 34 healthy adult volunteers and showed that a single dose of M281 achieved up to an 80% reduction of circulating IgG antibodies.We remind investors that Momenta plans to present the top line results at a future conference.Momenta’s novel therapeutics portfolio has three pipeline candidates — M281, M254, and M230.Meanwhile, the company is also trying hard to bring biosimilars to the market. Last week, Momenta and partner Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the companies will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN  -  Free Report) Eylea — in the first half of 2018. The commercial opportunity is significant. The company has collaborated with Mylan to develop, manufacture and commercialize six of its current biosimilar candidates.Momenta and Mylan have entered into an agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize six of Momenta’s biosimilar candidates, including M834, a proposed biosimilar of Orencia.Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings, Momenta announced that M834 did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Momenta’s stock have increased 8% in the last twelve months as against the industry’s loss  of 0.2%.Momenta has had a rough ride, of late. The company suffered a setback when Mylan won the FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals TEVA  Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved.Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers might be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. On the other hand, Momenta’s ANDA approval is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1330,MYL,"The biosimilar space was in focus in 2017 on key FDA approvals.Biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug. Development of biosimilars is technically more challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics. A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus, the market for the same is highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot many players which are witnessing rapid growth. Here we go through the progress report for 2017.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade (infliximab), in the United States in July 2017 after approval in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Remicade has been seeing intense competition in the biosimilars space of late. We note that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) supplies Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Pfizer is a strong player in the biosimilars market. In December 2017, Pfizer got FDA approval for another of its Remicade’s biosimilar, Ixifi, as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. The company has a portfolio of three marketed biosimilar medicines outside the United States, including Inflectra, Retacrit (epoetin zeta) and Nivestim (filgrastim) along with a strong pipeline of 13 distinct biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the biosimilars market — that has the potential to grow to $20 billion by 2020. Early last December, Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd. announced the FDA approval of Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst), a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab). Ogivri has been approved for all indications included in the label of the reference product, Herceptin, including the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and metastatic stomach cancer. Ogivri is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Herceptin and the first biosimilar from Mylan and Biocon's joint portfolio. Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) won FDA approval for the biosimilar version of Avastin in September 2017 for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. We note that Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Amgen’s biosimilar version of Humir, Amjevita, is already approved by the FDA and will be launched in the United States on Jan 31, 2023, after the company resolved litigation with the AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) The companies have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in July 2017. We note that the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980, which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval. The companies also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, two of which have been approved by the FDA. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Boehringer Ingelheim’s Cyltezo (adalimumab-adbm), another biosimilar of Humira, was also approved by the FDA in August 2017. Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusionOwing to the slew of FDA approvals, we expect investors to remain focused on this space in the near future.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1331,MYL,"The week has been pretty slow with key announcements including Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) job cut announcement and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) collaboration agreements with companies like Sangamo and Arvinas.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAllergan Announces Job Cuts: At the time of announcing third quarter results in November, Allergan had said that it would have to look at cost reduction in order to deal with the impact of loss of exclusivity (“LOE”) on key products including Restasis. This week, the company announced a cost cutting and restructuring program which will lead to the elimination of more than 1,000 currently filled positions, primarily in commercial and other functions. About 400 open positions will also be eliminated. Restructuring costs of about $125 million, primarily due to severance, will be recorded mostly in the fourth quarter of 2017 with overall operating expense savings expected in the range of $300 to $400 million compared to 2017. The company expects to achieve additional cost reductions through non-headcount spending rationalization (Read more: Allergan to Cut Jobs Amid Loss of Exclusivity for Key Drugs).Pfizer in Protein Degradation Deal with Arvinas: Pfizer has agreed to shell out up to $830 million to private biotech company, Arvinas, which is focused on creating a new class of drugs based on protein degradation. The companies announced a research collaboration and license agreement for the discovery and development of drug candidates using Arvinas’ proprietary PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) platform, a novel technology that is used for the creation of small molecule therapeutics aimed at degrading disease-causing cellular proteins.The multi-year agreement, which covers different therapeutic areas, will see Arvinas drive discovery efforts, while Pfizer will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of any products resulting from this collaboration.The $830 million covers upfront and milestone payments that depend on the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones. The deal terms include tiered royalties as well.Protein degradation is an area that has been attracting the interest of large cap companies – Arvinas has an agreement with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) as well.Pfizer-Sangamo Sign Another Collaboration Agreement: Pfizer has signed another collaboration agreement with Sangamo for the development of a potential gene therapy using zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs) for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (“FTLD”) linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. The agreement will see Pfizer shelling out an upfront payment of $12 million as well as milestone payments worth up to $150 million plus tiered royalties on net sales.While Sangamo will be responsible for the development of ZFP-TF candidates, Pfizer will be operationally and financially responsible for subsequent research, development, manufacturing and commercialization for the C9ORF72 ZFP-TF program and other resulting products.Sangamo and Pfizer already have a collaboration agreement that was announced last year for the development and commercialization of gene therapy products for hemophilia A, including SB-525 (Read more: Pfizer Collaborates With Sangamo for Gene Therapy).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

1332,MYL,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), in a regulatory filing, announced that it is laying off over 1,000 employees as part of a cost-saving and restructuring program to protect it from potential revenue declines.Allergan said the job cuts will impact employees in commercial functions that revolve around products and categories already facing or will face loss of exclusivity. Allergan also said that it plans to eliminate an additional 400 open positions.While the company estimates to incur costs of approximately $125 million, the job cuts and other cost-savings measures are expected to save operating costs between $300 and $400 this year. Also, the majority of the costs, primarily due to severance, will be recorded in the fourth quarter.Allergan currently employs more than 18,000 people.The job cuts come at a time when Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Alzheimer’s treatment, Namenda XR and blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis, which is expected to hurt sales.Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis, its second best-selling drug, from generic competition. Restasis recorded sales of $1.06 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Allergan came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe under which the latter obtained the rights to six patents covering Restasis and Allergan was granted exclusive licenses to Restasis products. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect Restasis from generic competition. The deal with the Tribe has raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drug makers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs.However, in October 2017, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Though Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024, a generic version may be launched as early as mid-2018.Also, this year, Allergan faces loss of patent exclusivity for Estrace vaginal cream and ulcerative colitis drug Delzicol. Last week, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the first generic version for Estrace cream.Also, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance (plecanatide) was launched last yearfor chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Allergan’s Linzess.In the past year, Allergan’s shares have declined 22.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 26.8%. The job cuts are aimed to save some dollars at a time when Allergan is facing competitive and generic pressure related to some of its highest revenue generating products.Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1333,MYL,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) have announced that the companies will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN  -  Free Report) Eylea — in the first half of 2018.The trial will be a randomized, double-blind, active-control, multi-center study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with the reference drug.We note that Eylea, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. Sales of the drug in 2016 came in at $5.2 million.Momenta and Mylan have entered into an agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize six of Momenta’s biosimilar candidates, including M834, a proposed biosimilar of Orencia.Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings, Momenta announced that M834 did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers.Meanwhile, a potential entry of biosimilars will impact Eylea’s sales, with the drug being Regeneron’s growth driver. Shares of Momenta have declined 10% over the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 5.9%.Momenta has had a rough ride, of late. The company suffered a setback when Mylan won the FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers might be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. On the other hand, Momenta’s ANDA approval is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval.Currently, Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of Humira, is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1334,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval for its monoclonal antibody candidate, fremanezumab, as a preventive treatment for migraine. With the FDA granting priority review designation to the BLA, a decision from the FDA is expected in mid-2018. Teva looks to launch fremanezumab next year.The BLA submission was supported by positive data from two phase III studies under HALO program, which evaluated the candidate in patients with episodic migraine (""EM"") and chronic migraine (""CM"").Fremanezumab is also being evaluated in late-stage studies (ENFORCE) for the prevention of chronic and episodic cluster headache. In the latest press release, the company also said the FDA has granted fast track designation for fremanezumab for the prevention of cluster headache. In addition, recently a phase II clinical program in post-traumatic headache has also been initiated.Meanwhile, Teva’s restructuring plan announced last week, which aims to lay off more than 25% of its global workforce and shut down some plants, has resulted in massive protests and strikes in Israel by employees as well as the country’s main public-sector labor union. The strikes briefly shut down the Ben-Gurion airport, banks, stock exchange and government offices on Sunday. Teva is one of Israel's biggest employers,Last month, Teva’s new chief executive officer, Kare Schultz announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity. The organizational changes included the departure of heads of three divisions.Teva’s shares have slumped 48.9% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 26.1%.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for its largest branded drug, Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which is hurting the company’s topline.Meanwhile, Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone’s sales have been declining for quite some time now. In October, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015 while Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly.Additionally, the company’s debt burden increased as a result of the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics in 2016. With nearly $35 billion in debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load. It remains to see if the latest corporate shake-up, planned layoffs and divestures are enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1335,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Appeal Board (“PTAB”) has instituted inter partes review (“IPR”) proceedings on all claims against two Orange Book-listed patents — U.S. Patent Nos. 7,476,652 and 7,713,930, respectively.The two patents are owned by Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) for Lantus (insulin glargine injection) 100 Units/mL.We remind investors that Mylan's 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”) for Insulin Glargine in vial and pen dosage forms is under active review with the FDA.In October, Sanofi initiated a patent infringement litigation against Mylan's NDA in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violation of 18 patents in the suit inclusive of these two Lantus patents.Lantus and Lantus Solostar are both approved for improving glycemic control in adult patients with diabetes mellitus.Sanofi’s diabetes franchise seems highly weighed on with its key product Lantus facing a tremendous competitive pressure at the payor level as well as from other biosimilars in several European markets besides Japan. Moreover, a biosimilar version of Lantus had hit the markets last December. Meanwhile, shares of Mylan have rallied 4.9% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s 26.7% decline during the period.Mylan is a leading generic drug company in terms of both total and new prescriptions. The company’s pursuit of first-to-file opportunities should help it maintain a strong position in the global generics market.Mylan is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market with potential to grow to $20 billion by 2020. A partnership with Biocon and collaborations with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Mabion have aided the company to develop a portfolio of 16 biosimilar/insulin analog generic products.However, Mylan’s performance in 2017 continues to be affected by the ongoing challenges in North America. The third quarter witnessed a fast decline in EpiPen sales, thanks to the launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of overall epinephrine auto-injector market.In a major boost, Mylan also received an FDA approval for the generic version of Copaxone 40mg. As one of the first filers, the company will enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. The recent FDA approval for Mylan’s biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin will also boost the company’s biosimilar portfolio.Zacks Rank Mylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1336,MYL,"This week, companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news with both providing regulatory updates. While Novo Nordisk gained approval for a new type II diabetes drug, the FDA expanded the label of Lilly’s Taltz.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Nod: Novo Nordisk got a major boost with the FDA approving the company’s new type II diabetes drug, Ozempic. Ozempic, a once-weekly GLP-1 agonist, is approved for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus. Approval comes shortly after an FDA advisory panel had voted in favor of approving the drug.Although Ozempic will enter a highly crowded market, it has been shown to lead to clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo, Januvia (sitagliptin), Bydureon (exenatide extended-release) and Lantus (insulin glargine U100). Ozempic is also associated with weight loss. Ozempic is expected to enter the market in early 2018 and represents blockbuster potential (Read more: Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide Gets FDA Approval for Diabetes).Positive Data on J&J and AbbVie’s Imbruvica-Rituxan Combo for WM: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner, AbbVie presented data on a combination of their BTK inhibitor, Imbruvica, and Rituxan for the treatment of both newly and previously-treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (“WM”).

Sanofi also announced that it has decided to end the development of its clostridium difficile vaccine based on a planned interim analysis which showed that the chances of the vaccine meeting the primary endpoint in a late-stage study were low.This is the latest blow for the company’s vaccine segment which is facing issues with its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, due to safety concerns. Earlier this week, the Philippines FDA asked the company to suspend the sale/distribution/marketing of Dengvaxia and withdraw it from the market pending compliance with the directives of the agency.Second Indication Approved for Lilly’s Taltz: Lilly’s Taltz (ixekizumab) gained FDA approval for its second indication with the agency giving its nod for the use of the drug for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Taltz was initially approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz works by specifically targeting IL-17A, a protein that plays a role in driving underlying inflammation in psoriasis (Read more: Lilly's Taltz Gets Approval for Label Expansion in US).FDA Nod for First Herceptin Biosimilar: The FDA granted approval to Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). We remind investors that earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar.

1338,MYL,"After weeks of speculation, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced its decision to acquire Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies. The cash and stock deal will see Aetna shareholders receive $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share with Aetna being valued at approximately $207 per share or about $69 billion ($77 billion including the assumption of Aetna's debt).News about a possible merger between the pharmacy giant and the health insurer had surfaced in late October when the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks with CVS proposing to pay more than $200 per share for the acquisition.With this deal, slated to go through in the second half of 2018, the companies are looking to change the healthcare landscape. The announcement comes at a time when insurers are under pressure to cut medical costs while companies like CVS are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given the rumors about tech giant, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), planning an entry in this space. While there’s low visibility on how Amazon expects to enter this market, its potential entry poses a major threat for retail pharmacy chains like CVS. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to strengthen its position in the pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") business with a wider coverage.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management.A key responsibility is the negotiation of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Formulary coverage and exclusion lists are issued by PBMs to keep consumers aware of drugs that are covered without extra out-of-pocket costs being incurred.  Clients include insurance companies with the focus being on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. By merging with Aetna, CVS will be able to expand coverage to the full ambit of healthcare including the medical benefits space. The combined company is also expected to be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. Moreover, Aetna’s insurance plans could help boost coverage and diversify CVS’s business.The combined company should be well-positioned to meet the health needs of many more people, especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Moreover, CVS Pharmacy locations will add additional products and services including space for wellness, clinical and pharmacy services, vision, hearing, nutrition, beauty, and medical equipment. Post-merger, CVS will find itself in the positon of an integrated retailer, pharmacy benefits manager and health plan provider.What Next?Of late, insurers and PBMs have been coming together especially if one keeps in mind the UnitedHealth-OptumRx combination. Given the changing healthcare scenario and the demand for more transparency where drug pricing is concerned, there could be more such mergers round the corner.Meanwhile, all eyes are focused on Amazon and its plans to enter the healthcare sector. Just last week, a CNBC report said that Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. There has also been news about Amazon having obtained wholesale distribution licenses from the pharmaceutical boards of certain states.

1339,MYL,"Every year, World Aids Day is celebrated on Dec 1 to raise public awareness about Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, popularly known as AIDS. The day is observed to make people aware about proper cure and prevention of the disease. In this regard, this year, the theme for the day this year is ""Right to Health."" This day also commemorates those who have died from an AIDS-related illness.World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO, globally, about 36.7 million people were suffering from HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children less than 15 years old.AIDS is a pandemic disease caused due to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections, eventually leading to AIDS. Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Currently, companies are investigating new medicines to treat, prevent and ultimately cure HIV. Scientists also are exploring new treatment paradigms like two drug regimens, making therapies/drugs drugs with improved long-term safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, this disease still has limited treatment options. In 2016, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, totaling to 35.0 million since the start of the epidemic.Based on these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R&D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS.Stocks to Watch For On World AIDS Day, here are some of the key pharma companies in the HIV market that investors can rely on.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) has a long-standing commitment to HIV and AIDS. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV. The sales of older HIV products — Epzicom and Selzentry — have been declining. However, the newer HIV drugs —Triumeq and Tivicay — are witnessing a consistent increase in sales and gaining market share.Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures are being used toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Last week, Glaxo and partner Johnson & Johnson announced the FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Edurant/dolutegravir and J&J’s Tivicay/rilpivirine into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen to be approved that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.This week ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), announced the start of a large late-stage African study that will evaluate long-acting cabotegravirinjection for the prevention of HIV in sexually active women. If approved, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months as opposed to presently available oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day.Already, ViiV Healthcare has started conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravirin HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, under co-funding with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Meanwhile, cabotegraviris also being evaluated in three late stage studies as atwo drug regimen withEdurant, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Furthermore, Glaxo is developing two drug regimen ofdolutegravir + lamivudine.Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. In fact, Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product, Genvoya, happens to be a bestseller surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Currently, Gilead’s bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February 2018.The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. This combination is also under review in the EU.Another company working towards developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). The company along with partner Glaxo recently received FDA approval for first two-drug regimen- Juluca, as discussed above. Further, the company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine.The study will evaluate whether the vaccine is safe and is able to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  HIV has a significant unmet need and women and girls account for about 60% of people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa.OthersSome other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report), Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) also recently received a tentative FDA approval for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Meanwhile, Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and in combination (fixed dose tablet) with other antiretroviral agents — lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The company plans to file regulatory applications for the same before the end of 2017.ConclusionAIDS/HIV is a life threatening disease which has limited medical cure. However, there are numerous companies that are developing drugs for the treatment and care for people suffering from HIV and for them who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, thereby making the space competitive.While Johnson & Johnson sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Glaxo and Gilead carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1340,MYL,"There was no major news in the cancer space this week, except the failure of Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bavencio in a gastric cancer study. In a setback to Eisai Co., Ltd. (ESALY  -  Free Report), National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) did not recommend the approval of its breast cancer drug, Halaven, for use in second-line setting in UK.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) filing for label expansion of Tagrisso in first-line setting for treating lung cancer was accepted by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). Apart from this, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Opdivo, again proved its worth by achieving superior overall survival (“OS”) in a phase III lung cancer study. Moreover, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) also announced initiation of a phase I study on its new oncology candidate, CDX-1140, in solid tumors.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer’s Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study: Pfizer along with its Germany-based partner Merck KGaA announced the failure of a phase III study evaluating their key pipeline candidate, Bavencio (avelumab), for the treatment of gastric cancer in third-line setting.The study – JAVELIN Gastric 300 – evaluated Bavencio as a monotherapy in patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and whose disease has progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens. However, another study, JAVELIN Gastric 100, continues to evaluate the drug in first-line switch maintenance setting.

1341,MYL,"While reports about tech giant Amazon meeting generic drugmakers made the rounds, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) were in the news with the former reporting late-stage data and the latter announcing leadership and organizational changes.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesIs Amazon in Talks with Generic Drugmakers? According to a CNBC report, tech giant Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. With not much information being available, there is a lot of speculation and discussion among industry watchers about the way the tech giant is planning to enter the market – as a drug wholesaler or a retailer.Pfizer, Merck KGaA’s Bavencio Fails in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and Merck KGaA suffered a setback in their efforts to expand the label of their checkpoint inhibitor, Bavencio (avelumab) with the therapy failing to meet the primary endpoint of superior overall survival (“OS”) compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy. The late-stage study was being conducted to evaluate Bavencio for the third-line treatment of unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma patients whose disease progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens, regardless of PD-L1 expression.The companies continue to evaluate Bavencio in the first-line switch maintenance setting for gastric cancer. According to information provided by the companies, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of cancer death. With survival in advanced disease being poor and usually less than a year, the third-line setting is a difficult-to-treat population (Read more: Pfizer/Merck KGaA's Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study).Leadership & Organizational Changes at Teva: Teva’s new CEO has announced changes in the organization as well as leadership structure of the company. A key change is that the generics and specialty medicines segments will now operate as a single segment across three regions – North America, Europe and Growth Markets. The Generic R&D and Specialty R&D organizations will also be merged into one global group while a newly formed Marketing & Portfolio function will be set up. With these changes, Dr. Michael Hayden, Dr. Rob Koremans and Dipankar Bhattacharjee will be exiting Teva effective Dec 31, 2017. Several new appointments were also announced while a detailed restructuring plan will be unveiled in mid-December.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track. Generic competition for Copaxone 40mg is another major setback for the stock.Teva has lost 59.1% of its value year to date versus the 29.2% decline recorded by its industry.Mylan’s Biosimilars under EU Review: Mylan and partner Biocon said that the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has accepted their marketing applications for biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Amgen’s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While Herceptin is used for the treatment of certain HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, Neulasta is used for the reduction of the duration of neutropenia (low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells) and the incidence of fever associated with neutropenia in adult patients treated with chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.Both marketing applications had been withdrawn earlier following an audit that was conducted by the European inspecting authority of Biocon's drug product facility. Biocon said that it has completed the Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) based on the audit – these will be verified during inspection as part of the regulatory review process.Meanwhile, the companies should get a response from the FDA for their regulatory application for their biosimilar version of Herceptin by December 3. Earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.J&J and Partners Commence HIV Vaccine Efficacy Study: With focus on World AIDS Day today, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health has initiated the first efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine. The study will evaluate the vaccine’s efficacy and safety in reducing the incidence of HIV infection in 2,600 women in sub-Saharan Africa. There is significant unmet need for a vaccine for HIV – although a lot of progress has been made in treating and managing the disease, almost two million people become infected every year. Developing a vaccine for HIV has proved to be challenging due to the unique properties of the virus including its ability to mutate rapidly. Moreover, genetic diversity with multiple strains and subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world are additional hurdles.We note that another efficacy study evaluating a different vaccine candidate is being conducted in South Africa.J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The stock has gained 20.9% year to date, compared to the 16.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.ViiV Starts Late-Stage Study for HIV Prevention: ViiV Healthcare, a global specialist HIV company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) with Pfizer and Shionogi Limited as shareholders, has commenced a late-stage study on long-acting cabotegravir for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women. The study will compare cabotegravir injections given every two months to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 0.9% over the last four trading sessions.

1342,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) shares have declined 7.9% this year so far, underperforming the 16.2% increase witnessed by the industry.The British pharma and consumer giant’s stock was on a rising trajectory till the announcement of third-quarter results on Oct 25. On the call, Glaxo expressed its interest to purchase Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) consumer healthcare business, which the latter plans to put up for sale. However, Glaxo’s interest in buying Pfizer’s unit raised investor concerns about the acquirer possibly sacrificing a portion of its dividend payment due to the potential buyout. Shares declined sharply thereafter. Since the earnings release, shares of Glaxo have declined 12.4%. Earnings estimates for 2018 also witnessed a decline of 4% in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, persistent challenges like stiff competition, genericization, pricing pressure and slowing growth in emerging markets have been hurting sales. Pricing pressure and competitive dynamics are hurting sales in Glaxo’s respiratory franchise, particularly the older products. Meanwhile, its top-selling product, Advair is also expected to face generic competition in the United States next year, which will further hurt sales. Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are looking to bring generic versions of Advair in the United StaresSales of Advair are already being adversely impacted by pricing and competitive pressure in the United States and generic competition in Europe.The slowdown in sales of the Consumer Healthcare segment this year due to a slowdown in global growth of its key consumer categories is also a concern.However, not everything is going wrong at Glaxo. Its newer respiratory/HIV drugs and vaccines are all doing well and will continue to boost revenues. These new products generated 29% of Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccine sales in the first nine months of 2017. Going ahead, Glaxo expects new pharmaceutical and vaccine products including contributions from Shingrix to deliver sales of £6 billion per annum by 2018.Meanwhile, Glaxo has made significant progress with its late-stage pipeline. We think Glaxo possesses one of the stronger late-stage pipelines in large-cap pharma. The company is focused on oncology, immuno-inflammation, HIV and respiratory therapeutic areas. By 2020, the company plans to terminate, partner or divest about 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs and instead allocate 80% of capital to priority programs in two current areas — Respiratory and HIV/infectious — and two potential areas - Oncology and Immuno-inflammation.Recent back-to-back approvals of three new products — Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD), Shingrix vaccine (prevention of shingles) and Juluca  (first dual treatment for HIV) —  have strengthened Glaxo’s competitive position.We would like to see if Glaxo’s strong pipeline, consistent outperformance of new HIV drugs and vaccines, three new products, and cost cuts can bring it back on track next year.Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Another large-cap pharma stock that has declined this year is Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) due to several notable pipeline setbacks this year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1343,MYL,"2017 has been a pretty good year for pharma and biotech stocks where FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body has approved 40 novel drugs so far in 2017, easily surpassing last year’s total tally of 22.There were quite a few landmark approvals this year including the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah for the treatment of certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals this year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of December.Cardiovascular Outcomes Data to be Part of Amgen’s PCSK9 Inhibitor Label? Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) is looking to add cardiovascular outcomes data to the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. With the FDA granting priority review to the company’s regulatory application, a response should be out on December 2.With cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death around the world, the addition of this data to Repatha’s label could boost the product’s sales. Sales of PCSK9 inhibitors, which were once considered to be worth multi-billion dollars, are yet to ramp up significantly. Repatha sales in the first nine months of 2017 were $221 million.Amgen continues to work with payers to improve patient access to Repatha. If the FDA allows the addition of the cardiovascular outcomes data to the label, the company will be in a position to promote Repatha's ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.Amgen’s shares are up 17.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 1.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to. While Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will the FDA Approve Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar? Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon should also get a response from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab) this month. The FDA, which had previously extended the target action date for the biosimilar in order to review some clarificatory information provided by the companies, is expected to give a response on December 3.   We remind investors that earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.Mylan’s shares are down 3.4% year to date, compared to the 30.2% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Will the FDA Follow its Advisory Panel’s Recommendation for NVO’s Diabetes Drug? Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), a key player in the diabetes market, will get to know the approval status of its latest diabetes product offering, semaglutide, this month. Once-weekly semaglutide is under FDA review for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes. With an FDA advisory panel voting in favor (16-0) of approval, chances of gaining approval look high.Novo Nordisk’s shares are up 43.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 16.2% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Christmas Cheer for Aclaris? Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS  -  Free Report), which is focused on addressing significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology, is seeking FDA approval for its lead pipeline candidate, A-101 40%, a topical treatment for seborrheic keratosis (“SK”). According to information provided by the company, 83.8 million people in the United States are affected by SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor, with current treatments (cryosurgery, curettage, electrodessication and excision) being painful or invasive. Timely approval would make A-101 40% the first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of SK. The FDA action date is December 24.Aclaris’s shares are down 14.4% year to date, compared to the 3.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Valeant Eye Drop for Ocular Redness under Review: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.'s (VRX  -  Free Report) New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Luminesse (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.025%) is under FDA review with a PDUFA action date of December 27. The topical vasoconstrictor formulation has been developed to relieve redness of the eye due to minor eye irritations. If approved, the eye drop will be the first over-the-counter (“OTC”) product to be developed with brimonidine tartrate for the treatment of ocular redness.  Valeant’s shares are up 13.3% year to date, compared to the 3.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1344,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) new chief executive officer, Kare Schultz announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity. The organizational changes that include the departure of heads of three divisions will be effective immediately.Shares of Teva rose 7.6% on Monday. However, shares have slumped 59.6% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.3%.The Israeli drugmaker will no longer have two separate global groups for its two businesses – generics and specialty medicines. Instead, Teva will now operate through three regions —North America, Europe and Growth Markets — which will include generics, specialty, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines.The Generic R&D and Specialty R&D organizations will be combined into one consolidated Global R&D unit.  It will be headed by Dr. Hafrun Fridriksdottir, who was until now serving as President of Global Generics R&D. A Marketing & Portfolio function has been formed that will take care of the interface between regions, R&D and operations.However, Schultz, who joined Teva on Nov 1, made no mention of the workforce reductions, rumors of which have been doing the rounds lately. Last week, an Israeli newspaper published a report, which stated that Teva will cut its U.S. workforce by “tens of percents” and its Israeli workforce by 20-25%.  However, the company did say that it is working on a detailed restructuring plan, details of which will be shared next month.The Israeli newspaper report also said its current head of R&D and chief scientific officer, Michael Hayden will be removed. In the latest press release, Teva confirmed the rumor stating that Hayden will retire at the end of this year along with Dr. Rob Koremans and Dipankar Bhattacharjee, head of its Specialty Medicines and Generic Medicine groups, respectively. Teva also announced some top leadership changes including Michael McClellan as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective immediately.Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of generic competition for its largest branded drug - Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches and a massive debt load.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which affects the company’s top-line performance. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue through the rest of this year and probably in the next.Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone’s sales have been declining for quite some time now. Last month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Meanwhile, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015 while Mylan launched its version of the 20 mg formulation last month. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly.Additionally, the company’s debt burden accrued as a result of the $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generic unit, Allergan Generics in 2016. With nearly $35 billion in debt, the company’s borrowing costs have increased significantly, which is hurting profits.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load. It remains to see if the latest corporate shake-up, rumored layoffs and divestures are enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, especially as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1345,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.00 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 per share by 4.8% and declined 24% year over year.Revenues of $5.61 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales increased 1% year over year (up 4% excluding impact of currency), mainly due to the inclusion of an extra month of revenues from Actavis acquisition compared with the third quarter of last year.Teva acquired Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics segment, Actavis Generics and also its U.S. generic distribution business, Anda, Inc. last year.Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition, the core sales performance was below expectations. Sales in the quarter were hurt by increased pricing erosion and volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit, ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment in the quarter.Segment DiscussionFrom the fourth quarter of 2016, Teva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition. The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business.Generic Medicines segment revenues were $3 billion, down 8% year over year.Revenues from the U.S. generics business declined 9% to $1.2 billion due to significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Moreover, accelerated FDA approvals of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines and increased competition for Concerta authorized generic, also hurt sales.European generic revenues were $985 million, up 6% (1% in local currency) from the year-ago period. This was due to the inclusion of three months revenues from the generic business of Actavis versus two month in the year-ago quarter.Rest of the world (ROW) generic revenues declined 18% to $843 million in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales rose 5% mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Actavis.API revenues declined 10% to $171 million. OTC revenues were down 22% to $306 million (up 15% in local currency terms).Specialty Medicines revenues were $2.03 billion, down 1% from the year-ago period due to lower sales of its central nervous system (CNS) products. Among Teva’s various therapeutic areas, CNS sales declined 12% to $1.15 billion due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, Teva’s lead branded product.Sales of respiratory products rose 30% to $351 million, oncology product sales rose 12% to $302 million, and women’s health business recorded a 9% increase in revenues to $119 million. Other specialty revenues rose 18% to $116 million.Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 7% to $987 million mainly due to lower sales in the United States. Sales declined 8% in the United States to $802 million due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation and negative net pricing effects despite the 7.9% price increase taken in January.Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation last month. In a major blow to Teva, last month, Mylan also launched its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly (3TW - three times a week) formulation - much earlier than expected. The 40 mg formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone scrips in the United States at the end of the reported quarter.Ex-U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 1% to $185 million.Among other products, Azilect sales declined 64% to $36 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the United States this year. ProAir rose 31% to $155 million, combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues declined 21% to $181 million and QVAR declined 1% to $95 million.The Other segment (distribution and other activities) recorded revenues of $569 million, up 122.2% year over year. The segment mainly gained from the inclusion of distribution revenues from Anda.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 800 basis points (bps) to 53% in the quarter due to the addition of the low-margin Anda distribution business and low margins in both the Generic Medicines and Specialty Medicines segments. Research & development expenses declined 6.2% from the year-ago period to $381 million. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 9.4% from the year-ago level to $805 million. Adjusted operating margin declined 600 bps in the quarter to 26.2%, despite lower costs.2017 Outlook SlashedTeva lowered its 2017 sales and earnings outlook for the second time this year. Teva now expects revenues in the range of $22.2 - $22.3 billion compared with $22.8 - $23.2 billion expected previously. The company expects earnings in the band of $3.77–$3.88 per share in 2017, significantly lower than $4.30–$4.50 per share expected previouslyIncreased price erosion and volume declines in the U.S Generics market, lower than expected contribution from new generic launches in the United States and the accelerated erosion in Copaxone sales following the earlier-than-expected launch of the 40 mg generic resulted in the guidance cut.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Teva estimates a negative impact of at least 30 cents per share on fourth-quarter earnings, higher than Teva’s previous assumption of 25 cents.Meanwhile many other filers, including Momenta are also looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40-mg formulation, which if approved, will erode sales further.Teva now expects new product launches to contribute $400 million to revenues compared with $500 million expected previously.Our TakeAmid already lowered expectations, Teva’s disappointing third-quarter results and the slash in outlook led to a sharp decline in share price.Shares declined almost 20% on Thursday, hitting a 52-week low of $10.85. In fact, shares have slumped 69% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 31.4%.Teva’s branded drug pipeline is progressing decently and it has also divested some non-core assets, mainly in the Women’s Health business, including Paragard and Plan B One-Step contraceptives, to cut its significant debt load. However, it might not be enough to revive the company’s fortunes during this challenging period, particularly as it faces erosion of its largest product, Copaxone.It will be interesting to see how its new chief executive officer, Kåre Schultz, guides the Israel-based generic drug maker to post a turnaround.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1346,MYL,"Match Group, Inc. (MTCH  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Nov 8.The company went public in November 2015 and in its first earnings announcement, as a publicly-traded company, Match Group had missed earnings estimates by 5.3%.The succeeding quarters proved to be slightly better, as the company’s earnings beat estimates twice for as many misses in the trailing four quarters, for a modest average positive surprise of 3.4%. Last quarter, it missed estimates by 15.8%.However, we anticipate Match Group to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Match Group has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Match Group has an Earnings ESP of +6.29%,as the Most Accurate estimate of 23 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank of 2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsMatch Group is the world’s foremost provider of dating products and operates a portfolio of more than 45 brands. Three of its biggest and best known brands are Match.com, OkCupid and Tinder. The company’s reputation, established user base and size are anticipated to prove to be favorable in the upcoming earnings.About 60% of the company’s revenues come directly from users of its dating services in North America, mostly in the form of membership subscriptions. Online dating has been expanding, as users from more demographics join the fray. Most of Match Group’s users connect from mobile devices, where conversion to paid members is also higher. Last quarter, its average PMC (paid-member count) rose 15% year over year, driven by solid contribution from Tinder, PlentyOfFish, Pairs and OkCupid. This momentum bodes well for the company’s top-line growth in the quarter under review.Match Group has been reaping profits for the past three years and recording top-line growth as well. The company is currently enjoying strong growth, driven by robust growth momentum at Tinder, solid performances from Meetic and Match, as well as the recently acquired — PlentyOfFish.Match Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Match Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Match Group, Inc. QuoteMatch Group recently rolled out a Tinder Gold subscription package, which is anticipated to drive incremental ARPPU as well as incremental PMC. Early results of the service are very promising, and it should benefit the results of the quarter under review.In the last quarterly report, Match Group had given its revenue projections for third-quarter 2017 in the range of $322-$332 million (reflecting 14% year-over-year growth at the mid-point), with an adjusted EBITDA of $110-$115 million for the quarter.However, a slight delay in launching Tinder Gold globally and weaker-than-expected ad revenue growth trends might dent the company’s top line in this quarter. Further, profits might be impacted due to higher investments in Tinder, which are also driving higher-than-expected data costs.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.69% and a Zacks Rank of 1, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 7.

1347,MYL,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Regeneron Pharma beat earnings expectations by 30.3%. The company’s performance has been mixed so far. In the last four quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed in two. Overall, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 10.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.  Regeneron’s stock has lost 2.3% year to date compared to the industry’s decline of 1.2%.Factors Influencing This QuarterRegeneron Pharma’s key growth driver, Eylea, is likely to continue to contribute to the company’s top-line growth.  Based on a strong first half, the company raised its sales guidance for Eylea.  In 2017, Regeneron Pharma expects Eylea net sales to grow around 10% (earlier guidance: growth in single digits) in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales (worldwide basis) is currently $1.4 billion for the quarter.We note that Regeneron Pharma has a global development and commercialization agreement with Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) outside the United States for Eylea. Product revenues from ex-U.S. Eylea sales are recorded by Bayer.Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharma is working on expanding Eylea label into additional indications. While a phase III study (PANORAMA) is evaluating Eylea for the treatment of moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without DME, another phase III study (in Japan) is evaluating it for neovascular glaucoma.Apart from Eylea, investors will remain focused on the uptake of new drugs — Kevzara and Dupixent. Kevzara (sarilumab), an anti interleukin (IL)-6 receptor monoclonal antibody was approved in Canada for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to or intolerance to one or more biologic or non-biologic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs and was approved by the FDA in May 2017. The FDA also approved Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).  The initial uptake of the drug is encouraging. The drug was approved in Europe also. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study).  A phase III study of Dupixent in pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) with uncontrolled persistent asthma was initiated in second-quarter 2017.Hence, focus will be on the company’s performance, particularly Eylea and Dupixient uptake during the third-quarter earnings call. Investors are also expected to await updates on the company’s pipeline.Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharma and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) are allowed to continue to sell their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit following a favorable ruling. This bodes well and we expect the management to throw more light on the upside if any. However, sales of the drug have failed to impress so far.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Regeneron Pharma is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.6%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is $3.99 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $3.93. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Regeneron Pharma currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) before going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1349,MYL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Mylan is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MYL in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MYL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.92% heading into earnings season. Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MYL has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

1350,MYL,"Shares of Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) were down 12.6% after the company reported disappointing results from a phase I study on M834, which it was conducting with partner Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) for the proposed biosimilar of Orencia.The company also reported a loss of 44 cents per share in the third quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The reported loss was, however, wider than the year-ago loss of 26 cents.Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. QuoteRevenues in the quarter came in at $24.1 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of $23.2 million. However, revenues were down 17.3% from the year-ago quarter. Momenta’s stock has decreased 15.1% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 4.1%. Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top line comprises product revenues of $10.9 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $23.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The 53% decrease was primarily due to higher sales deductions, inventory price adjustments owing to Mylan's entry into the Copaxone market along with a deduction of $0.2 million for reimbursing the company’s share of Glatopa-related legal expenses to Sandoz.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $13.2 million, up from $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a $10-million commercial milestone payment earned in connection with Glatopa 20mg/mL. However, the upside in sales was partially offset by less revenues due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, effective Dec 31, 2016.While, research and development expenses were up to $37.9 million from $31.6 million, general and administrative expenses increased 31% to $20.7 million.Outlook UpdatedMomenta now expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $200-$210 million, compared with the previous guidance of $210-$230 million in 2017. The guidance also includes approximately $50 million of capital expenditure on M923. Operating expenses in third-quarter 2017 are projected around $43-$53 million.Momenta expect to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis.Pipeline UpdateSandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter. The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. Currently, Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of AbbVie, Inc. ABBV Humira, is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Moving ahead, the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies.However, Momenta announced that M834 did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers. Hence, Momenta and partner Mylan will evaluate the next course of action.Furthermore, Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes: M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in January 2017 and completed in August 2017. Top-line data is expected in fourth-quarter 2017.Our TakeMomenta’s third-quarter results were overshadowed by the disappointing results from a phase I study on the proposed biosimilar verison of Orencia. Momenta has already suffered a blow. We note that Mylan has already won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved.Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. On the other hand, Momenta’s ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1351,MYL,"Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 6.Last quarter, the company missed expectations by 16%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.  Horizon Pharma’s shares have declined 12% in the year so far, underperforming the industry’s gain of 0.9%.Factors Likely to Impact This QuarterConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings, the company raised its outlook for 2017 and now expects sales in the range of $1.010-$1.045 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $985-$1.020 billion.Horizon Pharma is significantly increasing investments in one of its key growth drivers, Krystexxa, and projects peak sales of around $400 million in 2017 driven by higher demand. The guidance includes assumption of lower net average net realized price from the U.S. Government's Health Resource and Services Administration's Final Rule on 340B drug ceiling price implementation scheduled for Oct 1. The company expects continued double-digit net sales growth for Ravicti in 2017, with room for additional uptake due to the recent label expansion. The drug is also expected to be launched in Europe in the second half. However, sales of Procysbi will decline due to the divestiture of European rights. Sales of Actimmune are projected to grow in low single-digits driven by a year-over-year growth in the second half.Meanwhile, Horizon Pharma’s primary care business is under pressure due to the implementation of a new commercial model, where the company is teaming up with pharmacy benefit managers and payers to help patients obtain access to its medicines.During the third-quarter earnings call, focus will be on the performance of the business units, along with that of products like Actimmune and Krystexxa.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Horizon Pharma is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1353,MYL,"Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), saw its shares decline 9.4% last week with the company suffering a fresh setback in the form of FDA approval of a generic version of the company’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone (multiple sclerosis). Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its generic version of the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. Mylan has launched both products. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.The FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch – this means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.Copaxone brought in total sales of $1.99 billion in the first half of 2017. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, Copaxone 40 mg accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva.Generic pricing erosion remains a huge issue for generic companies like Teva. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.Consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit into the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. Teva also cut its dividend by 75%.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.The company has been working on addressing these issues and recently announced the appointment of a new CEO (Read more: Why Did Teva Pharmaceuticals Stock Soar Today?). Teva has also made significant progress in the divestment of non-core businesses. However, the entry of Copaxone 40 mg is a major setback for the company and it could well be a while before Teva is able to get back on track.Teva is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% downward over the last 7 days while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 5.1% downward over the last 7 days. Teva has lost 56% of its value year to date versus the 20.5% decline of its industry.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at five drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company has several blockbuster products in its portfolio including Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Otezla. Celgene has a rich and promising pipeline as well with key data readouts lined up for the next two years.Celgene, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has gained 20.3% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company also has a VGM Score of A. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. During the first half of the year, the company paid $8.9 billion in dividends and share buybacks to its shareholders including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report): Amgen, one of the most well-known names in the biotech industry, has a presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, nephrology, bone health and cardiovascular disease markets. Key products include Enbrel, Neulasta, Aranesp, Prolia, Xgeva, Epogen, Kyprolis, Repatha, and Blincyto among others. Most of these products are either blockbusters or have blockbuster potential. Amgen has a deep pipeline with the company working on bringing new products to market to combat the impact of potential biosimilar competition for mature products in its franchise. The company has been returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.Amgen is also a Zacks Rank #2 stock with a VGM Score of B. The stock has gained 27.1% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company holds a strong position in this market with two marketed products – Orkambi and Kalydeco. Vertex is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 110.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. The company’s partners include big names like Amgen and Novartis among others. Ligand also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology.Ligand’s recent decision to acquire Crystal Bioscience, a leader in avian genetics and the generation of fully-human therapeutic antibodies, is expected to boost the company’s 2018 revenues by at least $5 million and earnings by at least 9 cents per share.Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 39.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1354,MYL,"This week, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) were in the limelight. While Mylan and Teva were in the news related to the FDA approval of Mylan’s generic versions of Teva’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone, Allergan is under fire for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe for Restasis.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAllergan’s Restasis Deal under Fire: Allergan’s deal with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, announced early in September, has come under fire with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis, from generic competition. Under the terms of the deal, Allergan transferred six patents related to Restasis to the Tribe while being granted exclusive licenses to the patents. In return, Allergan will pay $13.75 million upon execution of the agreement as well as annual royalties of $15 million.Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. While one of the original patents on the drug's active ingredient was set to expire in 2014, Allergan filed additional patents extending protection to 2024.Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Mylan’s Gain, Teva’s Loss: In a major development, Mylan gained FDA approval for its generic version of Teva’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis. Mylan gained approval for the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could, therefore, enjoy 180 days of exclusivity though a formal communication from the FDA regarding the same is yet to come. Mylan has launched both products. According to QuintilesIMS, brand sales for the 20 mg and 40 mg doses were approximately $700 million and $3.64 billion, respectively, for the 12 months ending Jul 31, 2017. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.While the FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a big boost for Mylan, it is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch which means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva (Read more: Teva Shares Plummet After Mylan's Copaxone Generic Gets FDA Approval).Novo Nordisk Gets FDA Approval for Fiasp: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), which has a strong presence in the diabetes market, provided some regulatory updates on its diabetes franchise. The company gained FDA approval for Fiasp, a fast-acting mealtime insulin, for the treatment of adults with diabetes. The approval process was not exactly smooth with the company receiving a complete response letter last year when the agency had asked for additional information related to the assay for the immunogenicity and clinical pharmacology data (Read more: Novo Nordisk's Fiasp Gets FDA Nod for Diabetes in Adults).Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) endorsed the company’s plan to update the EU label of Tresiba to include results from the DEVOTE study showing a significant reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sanofi/Regeneron Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States.Favorable Court Ruling for Lilly: Another company that got a positive ruling on the patent front is Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). The company said that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) ruled in its favor regarding the vitamin regimen patent for cancer therapy, Alimta (pemetrexed for injection). If the patent is upheld, Alimta will be safe from generic competition until May 2022. This decision has removed an overhang on the shares. Alimta brought in sales of more than a billion dollars in the first half of 2017.This week, Lilly also gained FDA approval for a new cancer treatment, Verzenio, for use in women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer.Lilly has gained 19.2% year to date, compared to the 17.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 1.9% so far this week. Among major stocks, Lilly is up 3.1%.

1355,MYL,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) declined almost 15% on Wednesday after Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report), after hours on Tuesday, announced the FDA approval of its generic version of a 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of the former’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. The FDA also approved Mylan’s generic for Copaxone 20 mg formulation (once daily).Mylan confirmed the launch of both the 40 mg and 20 mg formulations in the United States on Wednesday. Mylan’s shares were up 16.2% on Wednesday.Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone, 40 mg version that has been approved. Mylan along with the other filers may be eligible to enjoy exclusivity for 180 days. A generic version of the 20 mg formulation of Copaxone, Glatopa, has been marketed since 2015 by Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm – Sandoz – and partner Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report).In response to the launch by Mylan, Teva issued a press release on Wednesday saying that any launch by Mylan before a resolution of various patent appeals will be considered an at-risk launch and could result in substantial damages for the latter.We remind investors that in January this year, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidated four of its five Orange Book patents for Copaxone 40 mg. Teva has appealed against the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Teva has also appealed in the same court against the December 2016 inter partes review decisions of the Patent Trial Appeal Board that found all of the claims of three Copaxone patents to be unpatentable.The 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone scrips in the United States at the end of the second quarter. With Copaxone generating almost $2.0 billion in worldwide sales in the first half of 2017, the earlier-than-expected entry of the generic version of Copaxone will be a major setback for the company.At the second quarter conference call, Teva had said that it does not expect any generic competition for Copaxone 40 mg this year. However, the company had also mentioned at that time that in case, one or more generic versions were launched for a full quarter this year, it will hurt earnings by 20 cents-25 cents per share. With the earlier-than- expected launch of Mylan’s generic version, Teva estimates a negative impact of at least 25 cents per share on fourth-quarter earnings.In addition to Mylan, Momenta is also looking to get approval for its generic versions of the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. The FDA approval of Momenta’s generic version of Copaxone has been delayed owing to manufacturing issues. Momenta’s shares were down almost 14% on Wednesday.As it is, Teva has been facing tough times and is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.Year to date (YTD), Teva has lost 55.7% of its value  compared with 20% decline of its industry.A challenging environment in the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela have been hurting Teva’s sales. The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure. These have been affecting the company’s top line performance. Higher FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation have increased competitive pressure in the industry. The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue this year.Meanwhile, delay in the launch of some new generic drugs and increased competition for some others is also hurting segment sales. New competition for branded products and a high cost base and debt load are some of the other woes. In August, Teva announced a 75% cut in its dividend.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1358,MYL,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) opened more than 13% lower on Wednesday, plunging close to their 52-week low in the process. The struggling Israeli pharma firm, which has faced significant pressure to reduce its debt load, is sliding once again—this time because of a brand new competitor.Indeed, the big news rocking the pharmaceutical world today is that Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report)—another major drugmaker wrapped up in its own chaos over the past year or so—has received FDA approval to sell a generic version of Teva’s multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.Mylan said that it wants to quickly introduce a slew of new generics to the market in an effort to curb rising drug costs. Today’s approval will certainly help the company’s top line, but it will also be the first step in this new plan—which should contribute to Mylan’s ongoing efforts to regain public trust after being embroiled in its EpiPen price hike scandal.Shares of Mylan opened about 15% higher and touched a nearly two-month high of $38.14. Teva, on the other hand, plummeted to $16.33 per share and is now down more than 54% on the year.Mylan had missed out on approval of a Copaxone generic twice this year, and company management was recently forced to lower its earnings forecast due to a delay in launching key drugs. In a note this morning, Wells Fargo analysts said the new generic should add 13 cents per share to Mylan’s quarterly earnings, so long as the FDA grants the company a 180-day exclusivity period.For Teva, this new competition could have serious consequences, as Copaxone generated more than $1 billion in sales in the second quarter alone.“The ongoing challenges to its generics business and that with FDA approval of Mylan's generic of Copaxone, earnings/cash flow are likely to affected,” Jefferies analyst David Steinberg wrote in a note. “[Although Copaxone] has been a strong contributor to cash flow over the last two decades, growing generic competition to this franchise has been an overhang on TEVA shares in recent years.”Fresh generic competition from Mylan only adds to Teva’s growing list of problems. Over the past few months, the Israeli firm has been desperately scrambling to ramp up assets in an effort to preserve its credit rating and cut its mounting debt.After completing its deal to buy Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics division last year, Teva’s debt pile swelled to a whopping $35 billion. In August, on the same day that the company reported lackluster Q2 earnings, slashed its full-year outlook, and cut its dividend by 75%, Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said that asset sales will likely generate at least $2 billion, well above that $1 billion level that was previously forecasted.For now, Teva remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, the company will need to improve performance in its own generics unit and pare down its debt quickly if it wants to lift share prices anytime soon.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1359,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for the generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) 40 mg/mL (thrice weekly).Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved.The FDA also approved a generic for Copaxone 20 mg/mL Once-Daily.Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity.According to QuintilesIMS, sales of Copaxone 20mg/mL dose was approximately $700 million and $3.64 billion for the 40 mg/mL dose for the 12 months period ending July 31, 2017. Hence, the generic approval is expected to provide a significant boost to Mylan.  Moreover, approximately 400,000 or 85% individuals in the United States suffer from MS and relapsing MS.  The news is expected to relieve investors. Mylan’s stock has fallen 16.2% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 16.5%. Mylan continues to face challenges in North America and uncertain regulatory environment in the region which has led the company to defer all major launches in the United States from 2017 to 2018.Mylan currently has 225 ANDAs pending FDA approval. 44 of these pending ANDAs are potential first-to-file opportunities. However, the company suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its ANDA for generic version of GlaxoSmithKline’s plc (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug Advair Diskus. Advair recorded sales of £1.8 billion in 2016. The company believes approval delays will persist in 2017 thereby impacting business further.  The company believes that increased competition resulting from the FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth, or fifth generics will also impact sales.Meanwhile, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) along with Sandoz is looking to get approval for their generic version (Glatopa 40 mg) of 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. Momenta’s sales of Glatopa 20mg continue to do well and have already captured approximately 40% of the market in the United States.Zacks RankMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1360,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced the reintroduction of the generic equivalent to Depo-Prover Contraceptive Injection (medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, USP) 150 mg/mL in the United States, indicated for the prevention of pregnancy. With the reintroduction, the patients will get access to an additional product in the market.Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, USP 150 mg/mL had annual sales of approximately $211 million in the United States, according to IMS data as of July 2017.Notably, Teva is the world’s largest generic drug company in terms of both total and new prescriptions. The company also enjoys a leading position in the United States, which is the world’s largest generic market, with a market share of 18% post the Actavis deal. Meanwhile, in the global generics market Teva commands 8.0% share.Following the Actavis Generics acquisition, Teva has more than 300 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) pending FDA approval including more than 100 first-to-file (FTF) opportunities. Excluding United States, the company has an estimated 1,400 regulatory filings pending in Europe and 600 in growth markets. Going forward, Teva is planning 1,000 generic launches globally in 2017 with more than $750 million in sales from United States’ product launches.Additionally, the company intends to pursue FTF and first-to-market opportunities and seek approval for complex generics that are likely to face less competition. This should help the company maintain its strong position in the global generics market. In 2017, Teva projects to generate approximately $500 million from new products.However, the generic market is highly crowded and Teva faces competition from players like Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Dr. Reddy’s (RDY  -  Free Report) and Sandoz-the generic arm of Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), among others. Also, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela is hurting sales at Teva, which led to a guidance and dividend cut in August 2017.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1361,MYL,"Shares of Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) have declined 24.7% in the last six months compared to the industry’s loss of 20.0%. Here we analyze the factors that led to the underperformance. Mylan is a global pharmaceutical company with a well-established generics business as well as a presence i specialty pharmaceuticals.However, the company continues to face challenges due to volatility and uncertainty in the world's largest pharmaceutical market — the United States due to pressure from both accelerated new approvals on the company’s existing generic products and continued consolidation of the customer base. Contributions from new product launches in the United States were one of the lowest in the second quarter.Sales from EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. Recently, Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) company which manufactures EpiPen Auto-Injector, the EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector and the authorized generic for both the EpiPen Auto-Injector and the EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector received a warning letter from the FDA.Mylan is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. A partnership with Biocon, and collaborations with Momenta and Mabion have helped Mylan to develop a wide portfolio of biosimilar/insulin analog generic products, representing a total brand market value of more than $75 billion in worldwide sales. The Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Neulasta, Humira, Avastin, Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs (Lantus, Humalog and NovoLog).However, the FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017. A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process.Meanwhile, the company’s efforts to get Advair’s generic approved suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to its ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. Advair recorded sales of £1.8 billion in 2016 thereby representing great potential. Although the company did not mention the contents of the CRL such setbacks are likely to weigh on the company’s shares. Moreover, the FDA recently accepted Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Sandoz’s ANDA for Advair. A potential approval will give Sandoz the edge over Mylan.Moreover, the company believes approval delays will persist in 2017 thereby impacting business further.  The company believes that increased competition resulting from the FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth, or fifth generics will impact sales.Hence, we expect the company to face challenging conditions ahead.Zacks RankMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1362,MYL,"The biosimilar space remains in the spotlight as a number of regulatory decisions are pending. While generic drugs are follow-on versions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug.Development of biosimilars is technically challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics.A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus the market for the same remains highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot of players which is witnessing rapid growth. Here are a few latest developments from this space:Leading the biosimilar space is Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm Sandoz, which is a strong player in the biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States.).The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon).Recently, the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan. In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017.In May 2017, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the world of biosimilars, a market that has the potential to grow to $20 billion in 2020. The FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) has been extended to Dec 3, 2017.A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the review period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process. We note that the Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar programs such as biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Neulasta, Humira, Avastin, Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs (Lantus, Humalog and NovoLog).Mylan has a collaboration agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to six of Momenta’s current biosimilar candidates, including Momenta’s biosimilar candidate, Orencia (abatacept). Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Meanwhile, Amgen and Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in Jul 2017. We note that both the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars, including ABP 980 which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval.Both companies have also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate earlier in 2017. We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline, one of which has been approved by the FDA. In March 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Amgevita, a biosimilar version of Humira in all available indications. The companies have an important event lined up as the FDA is expected to give a decision on the approval of ABP 215, a biosimilar version of Avastin shortly. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Last month, biotech major Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for Imraldi, a biosimilar version of Humira. This is the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the European Union following the approval of Benepali, a biosimilar of Enbrel and Flixabi (infliximab), a biosimilar version of Remicade. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In July 2017, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States which was approved by the FDA in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device.

1363,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) on Monday announced that it has hired H. Lundbeck’s (HLUYY  -  Free Report) chief Kåre Schultz as its new CEO. The appointment ended Teva’s more than six-month long search for a permanent CEO after Erez Vigodman stepped down in February this year.Israel-based Teva has been facing tough times. A challenging environment in the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela have been hurting its sales. Meanwhile, delay in the launch of some new generic drugs and fierce competition for some others is also hurting Generic segment sales. Teva is also facing several other challenges in the form of generic competition for branded multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, its key revenue generator, new competition for branded products, a high cost base and debt load.It remains to be seen if Schultz can use his 30 years of extensive global pharmaceutical experience to help the world’s largest generic drugmaker regain lost ground. Schultz will be tasked with increasing sales and reducing debt for the generic drugmaker. It is worth mentioning here that Schultz joined Lundbeck in 2015 when the company was struggling due to loss of patents for key drugs and helped the company to turn around, backed by significant restructuring initiatives.Meanwhile, the huge development at Teva has once again shifted focus to the Generic Drug industry, which is presently facing several challengesGeneric Drug Industry in DoldrumsThe Generic Drugs industry has a Zacks Industry Rank #246 (bottom 7% of the 250 plus Zacks industries). The industry has declined 15% year to date (YTD), significantly less than a return of 11.2% for the S&P 500.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs.A sharp decline in generic drug prices is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs, which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume.3 Stocks to DumpWith the generic pricing erosion expected to continue this year, we recommend investors to dump three of the biggest names in this industry, including Teva.TevaTeva has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Following its disappointing second-quarter results and trimmed view in August, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings declined by 12% and 13.5%, respectively over the last 60 days. On a YTD basis, Teva has lost 49% of its value compared with the 15% decline of its industry. Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report)Mylan’s second-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in the U.S. generic drug industry. The cut in annual guidance was also disappointing. Contributions from new product launches in the United States were one of the lowest in the second quarter. The generic maker also saw increased competitive pressure for its existing generic products, as the FDA approved more generics through accelerated approvals.Ongoing challenges in the United States and uncertain regulatory environment in the region have led the company to defer all major launches from 2017 to 2018 including generic Advair and generic Copaxone.Meanwhile, sales from Mylan’s key branded product, EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since August last year when the company came under the spotlight for an increase in EpiPen price, drawing immense criticism from lawmakers, consumers and the common people alike.Mylan is also a #5 Ranked stock. Mylan’s stock has declined 13.4% this year so far.Its earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have declined 12.6% and 10.8%, respectively over the past 60 days.Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (RDY  -  Free Report)This Indian generic drugmaker has a Zacks Rank of 4. Like its larger peers, Dr Reddy’s also suffers from drug price erosion, fierce competitive pressure and lower contribution from new product launches in the United States. In addition, the implementation of general sales tax (GST) in India is also hurting its topline to an extent.Dr Reddy’s earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have declined almost 19% and 9.3%, respectively over the past 60 days. Dr Reddy’s stock has declined 25.1% this year so far.ConclusionWhile Teva’s shares were up close to 20% on Monday, Mylan and Dr Reddy’s also shared some of the positive momentum as their shares rose almost 3% and 1.7%, respectively. The positive share price movement came after a long time for these generic makers.However, the relief is probably temporary as the companies have a daunting task ahead of countering the broader market challenges.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1364,MYL,"Shares of much-maligned drugmaker Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) climbed on Thursday after the U.S. Justice Department announced that it officially reached a settlement with the company regarding its EpiPen lawsuit.The U.S. Justice Department announced that Mylan will have to pay $465 million in settlement fees to Medicaid programs in all 50 states to end the nearly year-long lawsuit that accused the pharmaceutical company of knowingly misclassifying its EpiPen product as a generic in order to avoid Medicaid rebate payments.According to the lawsuit, Mylan knowingly bypassed the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which was put in place to prevent drug makers from price gouging brand name, single source drugs. The law forces pharmaceutical companies that have complete control over a drug to pay much higher rebate prices. Generic drugs that come from more than one manufacturer pay much lower rebate fees.The lawsuit states that Mylan simply classified its EpiPen product, which injects epinephrine to help treat emergency allergic reactions, as a generic when there weren’t FDA-approved drugs equivalent to EpiPen.The real kicker is that the lawsuit contended that Mylan upped the price of its EpiPen product by roughly 400% from 2010 to 2016, charging as much as $600 for the treatment.Mylan previously confirmed that the company had reached a settlement with the Justice Department nearly 10 months ago, but the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts did not make it official until Thursday.“Mylan misclassified its brand name drug, EpiPen, to profit at the expense of the Medicaid program,” U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb said in a statement. “We will continue to root out fraud and abuse to protect the integrity of Medicaid and ensure a level playing field for pharmaceutical companies.”The pharmaceutical company was also forced into a five-year corporate integrity agreement that will see Mylan under much heavier scrutiny. However, the EpiPen maker did not confess any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.""As we said when we announced the settlement last year, bringing closure to this matter is the right course of action for Mylan and our stakeholders to allow us to move forward,” Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said in a statement. “Over the course of the last year, we have taken significant steps to enhance access to epinephrine auto-injectors, including bringing a solution to the fast-changing healthcare landscape in the U.S. by launching an authorized generic version at less than half the wholesale acquisition cost of the brand and meaningfully expanding our patient access programs.”Members of both parties of Congress have said that the $465-million settlement is far too low and lenient.Shares of Mylan rose as much as 2% on Thursday morning but the stock still sits only slightly above its 52-week low at $30.95 a share. Mylan is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), but it seems that at least some investors and the company are relieved to have this lawsuit officially behind them. One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1365,MYL,"Wednesday, August 9th, 2017After 10 straight days of the Dow closing up — including nine straight all-time highs — investors may be forgiven that this robust bull market, on the heels of another successful earnings season, had the momentum to power through anything. Then a cold chill went through everyone when President Trump retorted to new threats of attack from North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” and the market sank to negative territory for the first time in almost two weeks. Likely we’re looking at mere idle rhetoric here. But if we’re not…Regardless what any investors’ foreign policy beliefs and background may be, yesterday’s episode is instructional: no market bull run is completely bullet-proof (nuke-proof?). It also may help give insight into what people like the Fed presidents are constantly on the lookout for: events capable of unsettling the steady growth we’ve seen for quite some time. It may serve as a convenient reminder that there may always be a pitfall lurking, and even in the seemingly strongest of markets, one eye toward caution might always be warranted.Productivity & Labor CostsEconomic data, meanwhile, continues its muted march to the positive; in this morning’s case, Productivity and Labor Costs reported more accommodative results than expected: preliminary non-farm business productivity reached 0.9% growth in Q2 2017, up from the 0.7% expected. Unit labor costs were lower than anticipated at 0.6%; 1.1% had been expected by analysts.Revisions to Q1 figures both rose in today’s latest account: productivity went modestly up from unched in the previous quarter to 0.1% this read. Labor costs, on the other hand, ballooned in the Q1 revision, from 2.2% last time to 5.4% in this morning’s version. These results are more data those tracking overall inflation metrics consider, and quarterly labor costs going up 5.4% for early 2017 may be something those charged with creating policy are circling with their red markers this morning.Earnings ContinueZacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Wendy’s Co. (WEN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates this morning by 2 cents to 15 cents per share, on quarterly sales that soared past the $299 million expected to $320 million. Restaurant comps in North America grew by more than 3% in the quarter. Shares are trading up nearly 2.5% in today’s pre-market.Generic pharma major Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) missed expectations on both top and bottom lines this morning: $1.10 per share missed the $1.19 in the Zacks consensus, and revenues of $297 million came up just short of the $300 million we had been looking for.Yesterday after the bell, Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) mixed fiscal Q3 earnings results — the company beat by 5 cents to $1.58 per share on revenues slightly below the $14.44 billion expected — were eclipsed by the announcement that the entertainment giant would be ending its distribution agreement with streaming major Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). Disney plans to create its own streaming services, whereby Disney and Pixar films would be streamed on its own subscription service, including sports content through its ESPN franchise.It’s a novel approach for Disney to shore up its content for the future. Near term, the market doesn’t like it: DIS shares are down nearly 6% in today’s pre-market. But in the longer term, perhaps the Netflix, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other streaming models are the right way to go for the company.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1368,MYL,"It’s been a tough week for generic drugmakers which saw their shares tumbling following the release of disappointing second quarter results from Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report). Teva not only missed on earnings and revenue expectations, the company also slashed its 2017 outlook and announced a 75% cut in its dividend.Teva’s shares plunged 34.1% in the two trading sessions following the release of second quarter results reflecting concerns about the company’s business and debt burden which triggered a few analyst downgrades. Year-to-date (YTD), Teva has lost 43.2% of its value versus the 12% decline of its industryChallenging Generic Pricing EnvironmentA key reason for Teva’s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.On its second quarter conference call, Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Generic drugs are basically cheaper versions of branded drugs which have gone off patent.Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year.And it’s not just Teva that was affected by the tough generic pricing environment in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), which reported a mixed quarter, saw its shares decline 11.4% over the two trading sessions following the release of third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company mentioned that generic deflation remains a headwind and is yet to ease from the high single digits, where it's been for about three quarters. Generic deflation is expected to remain a headwind for the remainder of fiscal 2017 in the range of -7% to -9%. The situation may continue in fiscal 2018 as well.Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) too mentioned that generic drugs pricing was a material headwind for the company’s Pharma Distribution business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects generic deflation in mid-single digits in fiscal 2018.Stocks in FocusFollowing the release of Teva’s second quarter results, companies with a presence in the generics market saw their shares declining on concerns that these companies too will be affected by the generic drug pricing environment. Companies like Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report), down 10.8%), Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI  -  Free Report), 10.9% down), Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report), down 6.5%) and Impax Laboratories, Inc. , down 10.7%) were down over the last two trading sessions. This week, investors will be focused on Mylan’s second quarter results including the company’s take on the generic pricing situation. Impax and Perrigo will also be reporting results this week.

1369,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 99 cents per share (including equity compensation expenses), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 per share by 6.6%. The year-ago adjusted earnings were $1.22 per share.Revenues of $5.69 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.85 billion by 2.8%. Sales, however, increased 13% year over year (up 17% excluding impact of currency), mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Allergan plc’s (AGN  -  Free Report) generics segment, Actavis Generics, including AndaTeva acquired Actavis Generics in Aug 2016 and also Allegan’s U.S. generic distribution business Anda, Inc. in Oct 2016.Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition, the core sales performance was below expectations. Sales in the quarter were hurt by increased pricing erosion in the U.S. Generics unit, ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment in the quarter.Segment DiscussionBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, Teva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition. The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business.Generic Medicines segment revenues rose 20% to $3.08 billion, mainly attributable to the inclusion of revenues from the Actavis generics business.Revenues from the U.S. generics business rose 45% to $1.3 billion due to the inclusion of revenues from the generic business of Actavis.European generic revenues were $957 million, up 24% (28% in local currency) from the year-ago period. This was due to the inclusion of revenues from the generic business of Actavis.Rest of the world (ROW) generic revenues declined 7% to $831 million in the quarter. On a local currency basis, sales rose 13% mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Actavis.API revenues declined 1% to $204 million. OTC revenues rose 6% to $283 million (up 40% in local currency terms).Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition, the core sales performance of the segment was poor due to accelerated U.S. generic drug price erosion and decreased volumes. Meanwhile, delays in the launch of some new generic drugs and increased competition for some others also hurt sales in the segment.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation is resulting in additional competitive pressure in the generics industry.The drug price erosion is expected to accelerate in the second half of this year. Teva said that the price erosion in the U.S. generics business is expected to be in the high single digits range in 2017.Specialty Medicines revenues declined 9% from the year-ago period to $2.1 billion due to lower sales of its central nervous system (CNS) and oncology products. Among Teva’s various therapeutic areas, CNS sales declined 18% to $1.16 billion due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, Teva’s lead branded product.Sales of respiratory products rose 3% to $322 million, oncology product sales declined 16% to $280 million, and women’s health business recorded a 2% decline in revenues to $115 million. Other specialty revenues rose 107% to $190 million.Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 10% to $1 billion. Sales in the U.S. declined 12% to $843 million due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation, which is facing generic competition and negative net pricing effects despite the 7.9% price increase taken in January. In Jun 2015, Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz launched Glatopa, a once-daily generic version of 20 mg formulation of Copaxone.Ex-U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 3% to $180 million.The 40 mg thrice-weekly (3TW - three times a week) formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone scrips in the U.S. at the end of the reported quarter. We note that Teva is facing patent challenges for the 40 mg formulation.Companies like Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals are looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. In late January, Teva suffered a major setback with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating four of the five Orange Book patents protecting Copaxone 40 mg. Teva intends to appeal against the decision. However, generic versions of the 40 mg formulation have not been launched yet. The FDA approval of Momenta’s generic version of Copaxone has been delayed owing to manufacturing issues.Teva does not expect any generic competition for Copaxone 40 mg this year. However, the company said that in case, a generic version was launched for a full quarter this year, it will hurt earnings by 20 – 25 cents.Among other products, Azilect sales declined 69% to $34 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the U.S. ProAir declined 9% to $123 million, combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues declined 21% to $163 million and QVAR declined 8% to $107 million.The Other segment (distribution and other activities) recorded revenues of $543 million, up 158.6%. The segment mainly gained from the inclusion of distribution revenues from Anda.Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 570 basis points (bps) to 56.8% in the quarter due to the addition of the low-margin Anda distribution business and low margins in the Generic Medicines segment. Gross margin rose in the Specialty segment. Research & development expenses increased 21.6% from the year-ago period to $450 million. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure was up 1% from the year-ago level to $906 million. Adjusted operating margin (excluding equity compensation expense) declined 330 bps in the quarter to 28.1%.2017 Outlook SlashedTeva slashed its previously issued 2017 sales and earnings guidance. Increased price erosion in the U.S Generics market, delays in generic launches in the U.S.and greater instability in the Venezuela market led to the cut in guidance.The revenue guidance was cut to a range of $22.8-$23.2 billion from $23.8–$24.5 billion. Earnings are expected in the band of $4.30 - $4.50, much lower than $4.90–$5.30 per share expected previously.Teva expects continued sales erosion for Copaxone in 2017 due to increased competition.Management said that the Venezuelan business is not expected to contribute anything to earnings in the last two quarters of 2017.Dividend CutTeva announced a 75% cut in dividend for the second quarter to 8.5 cents per share from 34 cents per share paid in the first quarter.Our TakeTeva’s second-quarter earnings and sales were dismal as the U.S. generics industry continues to face significant competitive and pricing pressure. The Israel-based generic drug maker also slashed its 2017 earnings and sales outlook to reflect the challenging environment in the U.S. Generics business and Venezuela devaluation. The U.S. generic industry pressure is expected to persist and management expects lower revenue and profits in U.S. Generics in 2018 and potentially 2019.The major cut in dividend - to help pay down debt and invest in business - was a big disappointment. Also, the company did not provide any update on a new chief executive officer (CEO) saying “this is a process we are not going to rush”.  Teva’s CEO, Erez Vigodman, had stepped down in February this year. Teva’s Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh, also retired in June.Shares declined 24% on Thursday, hitting a 52-week low of $23.33 per share. In fact, shares have slumped 34.5% so far this year compared with the industry’sdecline of 1.9%.Teva carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1370,MYL,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company posted its eighth consecutive earnings beat, recording a positive surprise of 6.1%. Parker-Hannifin boasts an average positive surprise of 14.5% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderParker-Hannifin continues to benefit from its extensive distribution network, which sells to the more lucrative MRO markets. Robust distribution sales help it reach out to smaller OEMs. We believe the company’s strong aftermarket sales are likely to raise its bottom line and margins for the fiscal first quarter. This apart, Parker-Hannifin’s revamped “WIN Strategy”, which cushions against global macroeconomic uncertainties, has acted as a staple growth driver.We expect the company’s Diversified Industrial -- North America segment to continue its solid growth trajectory in the coming quarterly results as well. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales currently is pegged at $1,504 million, which reflects growth of 28.9% year over year. The Industrial International segment is also projected to grow 16.7% year over year to $1,185 million.The Aerospace segment of the company has been tepid in recent times. In the coming results, we estimate its revenues to inch up 2% year over year to $572 million.Separately, the WIN Strategy, along with a host of other consolidation and simplification initiatives, has helped Parker-Hannifin garner significant cost savings and witness margin expansion. During the reported fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s adjusted segment operating margins expanded 120 basis points year over year, thanks to its concerted restructuring activities, undertaken over the last few years. This trend is likely to continue for the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation QuoteIn addition, the recent CLARCOR buyout, which strengthened Parker-Hannifin’s filtration product suite, will supplement the company’s recurring revenue growth. Also, other bolt-on acquisitions completed over the past two years, namely Jäger Automobil-Technik GmbH, Jäger Automotive Polska President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation, are also likely to stoke its inorganic growth for the fiscal first quarter.Despite these positives, Parker-Hannifin’s diverse geographic presence is exposed to currency headwinds. This apart, sluggishness in its key natural resources market that includes oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, might hamper the company’s growth.In addition to this, escalating prices of core materials like steel and aluminium are expected to erode the company’s financials for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, Parker-Hannifin’s high restructuring charges might pose as headwind for the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Parker-Hannifin will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0.00%.

1371,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 6, before the market opens.The company’s performance has been mixed so far, having topped earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and in missing in other two. The company delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.59% in the trailing four quarters.Last quarter, the company missed earnings estimates by 6.78%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Mylan’s stock has increased 0.3% year-to-date compared with the industry’s decline of 27.8%. The stock got a boost with the approval of generic Copaxone 40mg.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Mylan is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.92%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.25 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.21. A positive ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Consider This QuarterConcurrent with the second-quarter results, Mylan lowered its revenue guidance. The company now expects revenues of $11.5-$12.5 billion in 2017, down from the earlier projection of $12.25-$13.75 billion. The company now projects earnings in the range of $4.30-$4.70, down from the previous projected range of $5.15–$5.55. The guidance was lowered as a result of expected delays in the timing of certain new key product launches. Ongoing challenges in the United States and uncertain regulatory environment has led the company to defer all major launches in the United States from 2017 to 2018 including generic Advair and generic Copaxone. Pricing in generics is expected to decline in mid-single digits globally, with high-single-digit erosion expected in North America.Nevertheless, newly launched products are likely to perform well and aid the top line, while the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business should continue to boost the top line in the generics segment.In a major boost, Mylan received FDA approval for a generic version of multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Copaxone 40mg.  This is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. The company being one of the first filers, will also enjoy 180 days of exclusivity.  According to QuintilesIMS, sales of Copaxone 20mg/mL dose was approximately $700 million and for the 40 mg/mL dose was $3.64 billion for the 12 months period ending July 31, 2017.However, Mylan’s Specialty segment, of which EpiPen is the most significant product, continues to be weak. Sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector are anticipated to continue to decline in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch. Meanwhile, the company’s efforts to get Advair’s generic approved suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. The FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recently unanimously recommended approval of its biosimilar version of Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin. However, the anticipated FDA goal date set under the Biosimilar User Fee Act  has been deferred to December from September 2017.During the earnings call, we expect investors to focus on the performance of EpiPen, newly launched drugs and progress with the biosimilars pipeline.Mylan N.V.

1372,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) will be reporting third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 2, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 8.11%.This generic drug maker’s shares have lost 63.3% so far this year, while the industry witnessed a decrease of 28.7%.Teva’s earnings have surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, met the same in one and missed expectations in the remaining two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 1.66%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderA challenging environment in the U.S. generics business and continued deterioration in Venezuela have been hurting Teva’s sales.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure, which have been affecting the company’s generic revenues. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry.The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to hurt sales in the third quarter as well. In fact, at the Q2 conference call, management had said that the drug price erosion will accelerate in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, delay in the launch of some new generic drugs and increased competition for some others are also expected to hurt segment sales.Meanwhile, in the Specialty segment, loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone, Azilect and Nuvigil will hurt sales. Sales of blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Copaxone are likely to erode due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation, which is facing generic competition. Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, has been on the market since June 2015.In fact, earlier this month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Mylan also launched a second generic version of Copaxone 20 mg formulation (once-daily).Though these generic launches will not hurt Teva’s third-quarter sales and profits, Teva estimates that it will have a negative impact of at least 25 cents per share on fourth-quarter earnings.Meanwhile, low-margin Anda distribution business and low margins in the Generic Medicines segment may hurt gross margins in the quarter.Also, last month, Teva announced the appointment of Kåre Schultz as president and chief executive officer (CEO), thus ending its more than six-month long search for a permanent CEO. Schultz is likely to address Teva’s first conference call. We expect him to discuss his strategies to help the company regain lost ground.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -2.64% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.03 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.06 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Teva has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the biotech/pharma sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Agenus Inc.

1373,MYL,"We expect Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) to beat on earnings in third-quarter 2017. The company is scheduled to release its results on Nov 1, after the closing bell.The company missed earnings by 50% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Flowserve has an average negative surprise of 7.3% for the trailing four quarters, marked by two earnings beats for as many misses.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsFlowserve had a difficult second quarter, as its earnings missed by half, dragged by precipitous top-line decline, owing to macroeconomic volatility and foreign currency headwinds. Since the company did not anticipate any major turnaround in the adverse geopolitical environment and weak end markets, we expect these factors to cast a shadow on the upcoming quarterly results as well.The company has been witnessing acute weakness across its segments. Flowserve’s Flow Control Division (FCD), which witnessed 13.2% year-over-year decline in revenues in the prior quarter, will likely be weak in the coming results as well, owing in part to lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FCD segment revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $272 million, reflecting dismal contraction of 16% year over year.Likewise, its Engineered Product Division is projected to decline 9.4% year over year to $424 million in the upcoming results, marred by soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets. Industrial Product Division sales will also likely be hurt by low original equipment sales and we expect the segment sales to go down 11.7% year over year to $188 million.Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteHowever, the company has been witnessing some stabilization in core aftermarket activities concerning parts, services and repairs as markets return to regular maintenance schedules.We believe the company’s top line in the third quarter might benefit slightly from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia. Also, increased bidding activity in the desalination space is anticipated to bolster sales. This apart, the company’s restructuring initiatives over the past few quarters are anticipated to prove conducive to third-quarter results.Currently, the company is pursuing a $400-million multi-year investment plan, which is expected to result in $195 million of savings in 2017. These initiatives helped the company garner savings of $21 million in second-quarter 2017. Further, Flowserve is planning to trim its workforce by 15-20% as compared to the 2015 levels, as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions. We believe savings from these restructuring activities will boost profits in the upcoming quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Flowserve will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -5.21%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 32 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Flowserve has a Zacks Rank #3.

1374,MYL,"GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Nov 1.The company has had a decent earnings history, having beaten estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 10.3%. Last quarter, GoPro trumped estimates by a whopping 65.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect GoPro to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that GoPro has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: GoPro has an Earnings ESP of +300.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderGoPro’s HERO5 cameras are enjoying impressive market traction and this is likely to reflect well in the company’s quarterly results. The HERO5 camera is proving to be particularly popular in China and Europe. Also, the company has been booking strong accessory revenues lately, and this is anticipated to boost the top line in the quarter under review as well.We believe GoPro is well poised to capitalize on the fast-growing consumer drone market through its Karma. Karma’s success is an integral part of GoPro’s return to growth, along with the Hero5 cameras, and is likely to contribute well to this quarter’s top line.In September, GoPro raised its outlook for the third quarter, emphasizing that it’s on track to deliver profits after a long trail of posting quarterly earnings in the red (which was broken only once over the last seven quarters). It had originally projected revenues of about $300 million (+/- 10 million) for the quarter, with gross margins of 37% (+/- 1%). However, GoPro now anticipates revenues and gross margin for the quarter to come in at the higher end of its previous guidance.In light of several positive developments, the company’s stock has had a great turnaround on the bourse as well in the past six months — having appreciated 15.8% — outperforming the industry’s average return of 9.6%.GoPro’s optimism stems from its company-wide restructuring efforts, which include a combination of programs to cut costs. These comprise reduction of total workforce by 15%, shutting down the entertainment division and reduction of office space. These efforts will undoubtedly drive earnings for the quarter higher.Further, GoPro’s second-quarter results had been favorably influenced by a significant reduction in operating expenses. The to-be-reported quarter’s profits will also likely benefit from GoPro’s intensive cost-cutting and restructuring measures.Not surprisingly, some analysts have become increasingly bullish on the stock lately, with the company’s estimates moving north sharply over the past couple of months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 narrowed from a loss of 8 cents to a loss of 1 penny over the past 60 days, indicating positive analyst sentiment.GoPro, Inc.

1375,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced the appointment of Kåre Schultz as president and chief executive officer (CEO), thus ending the Israeli generic maker’s more than six-month long search for a permanent CEO. Share rose more than 12% in pre-market trading on Monday.Schultz, until now, served as president and CEO of Denmark’s H. Lundbeck A/S. He joined H. Lundbeck in 2015 when the company was struggling due to loss of patents for key drugs and helped the company to turn around. He has also worked as chief operating officer of another Denmark based drug giant, Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report).Teva’s CEO, Erez Vigodman, had stepped down in February this year. Dr. Yitzhak Peterburg took over as interim CEO while the search for a permanent CEO began. Teva’s chief financial officer, Eyal Desheh, also retired in June. Until Schultz, aged 56, takes over, Peterburg will continue to serve as interim CEO.Teva has been facing tough times and is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.A challenging environment in the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela have been hurting Teva’s sales.The U.S. generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure. These have been affecting the company’s top-line performance. Increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation have increased competitive pressure in the industry. The challenges in the U.S. generics market are expected to continue this year.Meanwhile, delay in the launch of some new generic drugs and increased competition for some others is also hurting segment sales.Management expects lower revenues and profits in the U.S. Generics unit in 2018 and potentially 2019 due to generic industry pressure.Teva is also facing several other challenges in the form of generic competition for multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone,  its key revenue generator, new competition for branded products, a high cost base and debt load. While a generic version of the 20 mg formulation of Copaxone is already on the market, Tevais facing patent challenges for the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. Companies like Mylan N.V.

The company’s shares were down significantly following the release of disappointing results in August. Year to date (YTD), Teva has lost 57.3% of its value compared with 17.2% decline of its industry. In August, Teva also announced a 75% cut in its dividend.During this critical period for Teva, it remains to be seen if Schultz can use his 30 years of extensive global pharmaceutical experience to help the company regain lost ground.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1376,MYL,"There were quite a few important developments this week with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announcing that it is streamlining its operations and cutting down its workforce as it focuses on developing new medicines and improving its cost structure. Meanwhile, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its CEO will be stepping down in 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly to Streamline Operations, Cut Jobs: Lilly announced a restructuring plan which will see the company streamlining operations so that it can focus on developing new medicines and improving its cost structure. The company will be cutting down 3,500 jobs with most of the reductions expected from a U.S. voluntary early retirement program. Lilly will also be closing down certain sites and will move production from its Larchwood, IA animal health manufacturing facility to an existing plant in Fort Dodge, IA. A research and development office in Bridgewater, NJ, and the Lilly China Research and Development Center in Shanghai, China, will also shut down.Lilly expects to generate annualized savings of about $500 million from 2018 – this will be used toward improving the cost structure, new product launches and label expansion studies. The streamlining program will result in the company incurring pre-tax charges of about $1.2 billion (post-tax charges of 80 cents per share) which will be recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. While this will cut down the reported earnings guidance, adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged. Lilly also said that with its streamlining efforts, it now expects to achieve an OPEX-to-revenue ratio of 49% or less in 2018, indicating an improvement from its previous forecast.Merck to Buy Rigontec in Immuno-Oncology Focused Deal: The immune-oncology space continues to attract the interest of big pharma players with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Rigontec in a deal worth up to €464 million including an upfront payment of €115 million. Rigontec's expertise lies in accessing the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway, which is a part of the innate immune system, with the goal of inducing both immediate and long-term anti-tumor immunity. The acquisition will add Rigontec’s lead candidate, RGT100, to Merck’s pipeline. RGT100 is currently in early-stage development in patients with various tumors (Also read: Merck Opts for Buying German Immuno-Oncology Biotech).Merck also announced that the European Commission has expanded the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer (Also read: Merck's Keytruda Gets EU Approval for Bladder Cancer).BMY’s Opdivo Impresses in RCC Study: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) had some mixed news on its PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The company said that  a late-stage study (CheckMate -214) evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy  was stopped early for showing overall survival (“OS”) benefit in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).Following a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) recommended that the study should be stopped early. The combination would provide RCC patients with a new first-line treatment option. Approval for this indication would boost sales significantly. There is significant unmet need in this area with RCC being the most common type of kidney cancer in adults with a five-year survival rate for the advanced or metastatic stage being 12.1%.The second set of Opdivo related news was not so encouraging with the company saying that a partial clinical hold has been placed by the FDA on three Opdivo-based combination studies in multiple myeloma. The FDA decided to place the studies on partial hold following the identification of risks identified in combination studies evaluating Merck’s Keytruda for multiple myeloma.Mylan Faces 3-Month Delay in Herceptin Biosimilar Decision: Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon will have to wait a bit longer before they get a response from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The FDA informed Mylan that it is extending the target action date by three months so that it can review some of the clarificatory information submitted to them as a part of the application review process. As a result, the regulatory body will now issue a response regarding the approval status of the biosimilar on Dec 3, 2017.The biosimilar version had received a favorable vote (16-0) in July from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”). Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Novartis CEO to Retire in 2018, Replacement Announced: Novartis’ CEO, Joseph Jimenez, will be stepping down from his position in 2018. The Board of Directors has appointed Vasant (Vas) Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, as his successor, effective Feb 1, 2018 (Also read: Narasimhan to Replace Jimenez as Novartis CEO in 2018).

The letter mentions significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (“CGMP”) requirements for combination products. The company has been accused of failing to thoroughly investigate several serious component and product failures for its EpiPen products (manufactured on behalf of Mylan), including failures associated with patient deaths and severe illness.Earlier this year in March, Meridian Medical Technologies had announced a voluntary recall of its EpiPen products following the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside the United States of failure to activate the device due to a potential defect in a supplier component.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1.5% over the last four trading sessions.

1377,MYL,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 31 drugs so far in 2017 including five in August. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.A recent landmark approval was that of Novartis’ Kymriah, making it the first gene therapy in the United States. This marks the beginning of a new era for the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of September.Will the FDA Follow the Advisory Panel Vote for Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar?Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) should hear from the FDA soon about the approval status of its biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The company and its partner, Biocon Ltd. got a favorable vote (16-0) from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) in July for the biosimilar. Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Earlier this year, Mylan had entered into a global settlement agreement with Roche’s Genentech, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. for Herceptin (trastuzumab), under which Mylan got global licenses (excluding Japan, Brazil and Mexico) for its trastuzumab product. Mylan could well be the first to launch a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the United States. Approval would boost investor sentiment for the company which has lost 17.3% year to date versus the 17.9% decline of its industry.FDA Advisory Panels to Discuss Glaxo, Pfizer & PTC Therapeutics DrugsQuite a few FDA advisory panel meetings are scheduled for this month. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Committee (VRBPAC) will be meeting on Sep 13 to discuss the safety and effectiveness of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Shingrix. Glaxo is looking to get the non-live, recombinant vaccine approved for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in people who are 50 years old or above. Shingles, a common and potentially serious condition, can cause lasting pain and other complications such as scarring or visual impairment.Then on Sep 19, the FDA’s ODAC will be meeting to discuss the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) submitted by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) for its cancer drug, Sutent. Pfizer is looking to expand Sutent’s label for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney). The FDA is expected to render a final decision regarding the label expansion in Jan 2018. Sutent brought in sales of $529 million in the first half of 2017.Later this month, on Sep 28, the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss PTC Therapeutics’ (PTCT  -  Free Report) new drug application (“NDA”) for Translarna (ataluren) for the treatment of patients with dystrophinopathy due to a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. Translarna is already approved outside the United States. The FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of the drug by Oct 24, 2017.Will the FDA Grant Approval to Amgen/Allergan’s Avastin Biosimilar?Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan are also expecting a decision from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). With the companies getting a favorable vote from an FDA advisory panel (“ODAC”) recently, chances of gaining approval on the FDA action date of Sep 14 look good. Shares of Amgen have gained 22.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 15.9%.Merck, Bristol-Myers Seek Label ExpansionMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for use in the treatment of recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Keytruda is under priority review for this indication with a response expected on Sep 22. Keytruda, which brought in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017, is a key product in Merck’s portfolio and is being evaluated for a wide range of indications. Merck has gained 8.4% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is also looking to expand the label of its PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo. Opdivo is under priority review for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) after prior treatment with Nexavar (sorafenib). The FDA is expected to give a response on Sep 24, 2017. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has gained 2.5% year to date versus the 12.3% growth of its industry.Will the FDA Approve J&J’s Plivensia?Johnson & Johnson’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, is under FDA review with a response expected on Sep 23. However, early in August, Plivensia failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. J&J is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, it’s quite likely that the agency will ask for additional information before granting approval. Shares of J&J have gained 13.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally.Neos Therapeutics is also awaiting a decision this month for NT-0201, its amphetamine XR liquid suspension product candidate for attention deficit hyperactive disorder (“ADHD”). Approval on Sep 15, 2017 would allow the company to go ahead with its plans to launch the product in Jan 2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1378,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and Japan-based Otsuka Pharmaceutical signed a license agreementto commercialize Deltyba (delamanid) in low- and middle-income countries, including South Africa and India. The drug is approved for treatment of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults.Deltyba was developed and is currently marketed by Otsuka.Mylan’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The company has lost 20.8% while the industry lost 19.9% in that period.Per the agreement, Otsuka granted exclusive license to Mylan to prioritize access to Deltyb in South Africa and India. The agreement also allows both the companies to initiate a technology transfer plan to enable Mylan to manufacture and distribute Deltyba in additional countries where Otsuka may expand its commercial presence.However, no financial terms were discussed in the release.Deltyba was studied in a phase II trial for around 33 months in combination with a World Health Organization (WHO) recommended optimized background regimen (OBR). The data from the study showed statistically significant over placebo. Moreover, Deltyba also lowered mortality rate in patients when administered for at least six months. Data from the phase III study is expected in 2018. As per WHO, South Africa and India are among the highest-burden countries for MDR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection. It is estimated that more there were more than 150,000-plus new cases of MDR-TB/rifampicin-resistant TB in 2015 in these countries.Deltyba has been approved by Drug Controller General of India and the registration process is underway in South Africa.Deltyba is approved in EU, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Turkey and India. Successful commercialization of the drug in these countries and other countries upon receiving approval will help Mylan in the long run.However, Mylan is facing a tough year. Ongoing challenges in the U.S. and uncertain regulatory environment in the region has led the company to defer all major launches in the country. It has also lowered its annual guidance for 2017.Moreover, the FDA issued a complete response letter to Mylan’s abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK  -  Free Report) Advair earlier this year while accepting Sandoz's ANDA for the same. The potential approval of Sandoz’s, a subsidiary of Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report), ANDA will hurt Mylan. Also, in Apr 2017, Mylan received a warning letter from the FDA for its manufacturing facility in India.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V.

1379,MYL,"Shares of Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) have lost almost 19.4% in the year so far thereby underperforming the 4.5% increase registered by the industry during this period. Here we analyze the factors that led to the underperformance.Mylan, a global pharmaceutical company has a well-established generics business and is known for specialty pharmaceuticals products.We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since August 2016 when the company faced severe criticism from lawmakers, consumers and the common people alike for price increase of EpiPen since its acquisition of the drug in 2007. Further, Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The misclassification implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one.The company recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and two other relators which finalizes the Medicaid drug rebate settlement worth $465 million, announced in Oct 2016.Sales from EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP  -  Free Report) recently received FDA nod for Symjepi, a generic version of EpiPen. EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America in 2017.The company’s efforts to get the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug Advair Diskus suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its ANDA for the generic version. Although the company did not mention the contents of the CRL such setbacks are likely to weigh on shares.Moreover, the FDA recently accepted Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) Sandoz's ANDA for Advair. A potential approval will give Sandoz the edge over Mylan. Moreover, the company believes that approval delays will persist in 2017 thereby impacting business further. The company believes that increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics will impact sales.Meanwhile, Mylan’s second-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America. The cut in annual guidance was also disappointing. Mylan now expects revenues of $11.5-$12.5 billion in 2017, down from the earlier projection of $12.25-$13.75 billion.The company now projects earnings per share in the range of $4.30-$4.70, down from the previous projected range of $5.15-$5.55. The guidance was lowered due to expected delays in the timing of certain key new product launches.2017 will be challenging for the company due to volatility and uncertainty in the world's largest pharmaceutical market — the U.S. due to pressure from both accelerated new approvals on the company’s existing generic products and continued consolidation of the customer base. Contributions from new product launches in the U.S. were one of the lowest in the second quarter. The company also saw increased competition for its existing generic products, as FDA approves more generics through accelerated approvals.Zacks RankMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1380,MYL,"Investors in Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 25th, 2017 $34 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Mylan shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Mylan is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical - Generic Drugs industry that ranks in the Bottom 7% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.45 per share to $1.20 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Mylan right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1381,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) recently announced that its subsidiaries, Mylan Inc. and Mylan Specialty L.P., have signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and two other relators. The agreement finalizes the Medicaid drug rebate settlement worth $465 million, announced in Oct 2017.  The settlement resolves claims which relates to the classification of EpiPen Auto-Injector and EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.DOJ wanted to ascertain whether EpiPen products were properly classified with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a non-innovator drug under the applicable definition in the Medicaid Rebate statute. The drugs were subjected to the formula which is used to calculate rebates to Medicaid for such drugs.We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since Aug 2016 when the company came under the spotlight for price increase of EpiPen since its acquisition of the drug in 2007, drawing immense criticism from lawmakers, consumers and the common people alike. Further, Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The misclassification implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one.EpiPen Auto-Injector was classified as a non-innovator drug with CMS before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on longstanding written guidance from the federal government.Nevertheless, the settlement provides for resolution of all potential Medicaid rebate liability claims by the federal government, as well as potential claims by certain hospitals and other covered entities that participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Moreover, Mylan will reclassify EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and pay the rebate applicable to innovator products, effective Apr 1.Mylan’s stock has fallen 16.7% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%.Mylan’s second-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America.

1382,MYL,"Pharmaceutical stocks were in the limelight this week with Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier resigning from President Donald Trump’s manufacturing council. The sector was also in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBayer, Novartis, Teva & Others Face MS Drug Price Probe: Drug pricing is back in the news with an investigation into the skyrocketing prices of MS drugs being launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch. Letters have been sent to seven companies including Biogen, Teva, Roche, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Merck KGaA, Bayer and Sanofi requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs. The letters have also raised the issue of “shadow pricing” – when an expensive new drug is launched or the price of an existing drug is raised, other companies follow suit and increase prices to match the higher prices.  According to an American Academy of Neurology study, annual sales of MS drugs doubled from $4 billion to almost $9 billion from 2008 to 2012.  Meanwhile, information provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society shows that the average wholesale price of MS disease modifying therapies was $16,000 in 2004 and shot up to $61,000 in 2013 and $83,688 in 2017. Mylan to pay $465M under DoJ Settlement: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that an agreement has been signed with the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") and two relators regarding the Medicaid drug rebate settlement for $465 million.

According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Besponsa’s approval path in the U.S. included a Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review. Although the label comes with a black box warning for hepatotoxicity, this should not impact uptake given the poor survival rate for this patient population. EU approval for Besponsa came earlier this year in June.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Combination Disappoints in Kidney Cancer Study:  Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo failed to meet one of the co-primary endpoints in a late stage study evaluating the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor plus Yervoy versus Sutent (sunitinib) in intermediate and poor-risk patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer. The Opdivo-Yervoy combination met the objective response rate co-primary endpoint (41.6% versus 26.5%) but failed to show statistical significance for progression-free survival. The third co-primary endpoint of overall survival is yet to mature. Opdivo is approved for second-line renal cell carcinoma and positive data from this study would have helped support label expansion into the first-line setting. With the study ongoing for overall survival data, hitting this co-primary endpoint could support label expansion (Also read: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Fails Kidney Cancer Trial CheckMate-214).

1383,MYL,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in MYL.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen six estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions.

1384,MYL,"Second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with most major companies having reported results. This week, companies like Endo, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk and Perrigo (PRGO  -  Free Report) presented their second quarter results.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Mylan’s second quarter results were disappointing with the company missing on both earnings and revenues and cutting its outlook (Also read: Mylan Misses on Q2 Earnings & Sales, Lowers View). Mylan has pushed back all major product launches in the U.S. from 2017 to 2018 reflecting ongoing challenges and the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment. These product launches include generic versions of Advair and Copaxone. Escalating price erosion in the generics market remains a major challenge. Meanwhile, Mylan got a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in late Jul 2017 seeking information relating to opioids manufactured, marketed or sold by the company from Jan 1, 2013 to Dec 31, 2016. Mylan has lost 15.4% of its value year to date versus the 15.8% decline of its industry.Perrigo’s second quarter results were better-than-expected with the company raising its outlook (Also read: Perrigo Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, 2017 View Raised). Novo Nordisk also topped earnings estimates and raised its outlook. Meanwhile, Endo, which topped earnings and revenue estimates, lowered its outlook (Also read: Endo Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales, 2017 Guidance Lowered). Endo stock has lost 54.2% of its value year to date versus the 1.8% decline of its industry.Perrigo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

The mid-stage triplet oral therapy study met its primary endpoint of greater LDL-C lowering compared to placebo. The company intends to conduct additional studies next year and expects to file for FDA approval of the combination by the first quarter of 2019.Zynerba Plunges as STAR 1 Fails to Shine: Zynerba  saw its shares plunging 55.7% on disappointing mid-stage data on the company’s experimental cannabinoid treatment, ZYN002. Results from the double-blind placebo controlled STAR 1 study in adult epilepsy patients with focal seizures showed that both doses of ZYN002 failed to meet the endpoints compared to placebo. Focus has now shifted to a couple more studies being conducted with ZYN002 – osteoarthritis (top-line data expected in Aug 2017) and Fragile X syndrome (top-line data expected in Sep 2017).  Valeant Gets CRL for Eye Drop: Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report), which reported second quarter results this week (Also read: Valeant Beats Q2 Earnings, Sales in Line, Trims View), got a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for its new drug application (“NDA”) for Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%). The company is looking to gain approval for the use of the intraocular pressure lowering single-agent eye drop in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. While no safety or efficacy concerns were raised by the FDA, the CRL referred to a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”) inspection at Bausch + Lomb's manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL. Valeant is working on resolving manufacturing quality issues at the Tampa plant and will be working with the agency to determine the path forward.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.9% over the last five trading sessions.

1385,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) reported disappointing second-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales missed estimates. The company also lowered its guidance. Shares are trading down due to dismal results.Mylan’s stock fell 16.7% year-to-date compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%.The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 and was down from $1.16 reported in the year-ago quarter.Second-quarter revenues of $2.96 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.00 billion. Nevertheless, the top line recorded 15.7% year-over-year growth on the back of acquisitions.Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe company report results in three segments on a geographic basis – North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment third party net sales came in at $1.28 billion, down 9% due to a decline in sales of existing products as a result of lower volume and pricing which more than offset the acquisitions of Meda AB and the non-sterile, topicals-focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC. Sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter due to increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch. Generics products experienced price erosion in the mid-single digits.Third party net sales from Europe were $954.3 million, up 59% propelled by the acquisition of Meda which was partially offset by lower volume on existing products. Unfavorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 3% within Europe.Rest of World segment third party net sales of $692.6 million was up 29% fueled by the Meda acquisition. Moreover, net sales from existing products increased due to higher sales from the anti-retroviral franchise while sales from new products and higher volumes on existing products more than offset lower pricing. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 2%.Adjusted gross margin declined to 54% from 56% in the year-ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including the EpiPen Auto-Injector, partially offset by the contributions from the acquired businesses.2017 Outlook LoweredMylan now expects revenues of $11.5–$12.5 billion in 2017, down from the earlier projection of $12.25–$13.75 billion in 2017. The company now projects earnings in the range of $4.30–$4.70, down from the previous projected range of $5.15–$5.55. The guidance was lowered as a result of expected delays in the timing of certain key new product launches.Ongoing challenges in the U.S. and uncertain regulatory environment in the region has led the company to defer all major launches in the U.S. from the 2017 guidance to 2018 including generic Advair and generic Copaxone. Pricing in generics is expected to decline in mid-single digits globally, with high-single-digit erosion expected in North America.Our TakeMylan’s second-quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America. Pricing continues to impact results and the company projects mid-single digit price erosion globally. The decrease in guidance was also disappointing. The company recently suffered a few setbacks.Mylan received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its abbreviated new drug application ANDA for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug Advair Diskus.On a positive note, the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recently unanimously recommended approval of Mylan's biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug Herceptin.Zacks Rank & Key PickMylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Gilead Sciences, Inc.

1386,MYL,"After 10 straight days of the Dow closing up — including nine straight all-time highs — investors may be forgiven that this robust bull market, on the heels of another successful earnings season, had the momentum to power through anything. Then a cold chill went through everyone when President Trump retorted to new threats of attack from North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” and the market sank to negative territory for the first time in almost two weeks. Likely we’re looking at mere idle rhetoric here. But if we’re not…Regardless what any investors’ foreign policy beliefs and background may be, yesterday’s episode is instructional: no market bull run is completely bullet-proof (nuke-proof?). It also may help give insight into what people like the Fed presidents are constantly on the lookout for: events capable of unsettling the steady growth we’ve seen for quite some time. It may serve as a convenient reminder that there may always be a pitfall lurking, and even in the seemingly strongest of markets, one eye toward caution might always be warranted.Productivity & Labor CostsEconomic data, meanwhile, continues its muted march to the positive; in this morning’s case, Productivity and Labor Costs reported more accommodative results than expected: preliminary non-farm business productivity reached 0.9% growth in Q2 2017, up from the 0.7% expected. Unit labor costs were lower than anticipated at 0.6%; 1.1% had been expected by analysts.Revisions to Q1 figures both rose in today’s latest account: productivity went modestly up from unched in the previous quarter to 0.1% this read. Labor costs, on the other hand, ballooned in the Q1 revision, from 2.2% last time to 5.4% in this morning’s version. These results are more data those tracking overall inflation metrics consider, and quarterly labor costs going up 5.4% for early 2017 may be something those charged with creating policy are circling with their red markers this morning.Earnings ContinueZacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Wendy’s Co. (WEN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates this morning by 2 cents to 15 cents per share, on quarterly sales that soared past the $299 million expected to $320 million. Restaurant comps in North America grew by more than 3% in the quarter. Shares are trading up nearly 2.5% in today’s pre-market.Generic pharma major Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) missed expectations on both top and bottom lines this morning: $1.10 per share missed the $1.19 in the Zacks consensus, and revenues of $297 million came up just short of the $300 million we had been looking for.Yesterday after the bell, Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) mixed fiscal Q3 earnings results — the company beat by 5 cents to $1.58 per share on revenues slightly below the $14.44 billion expected — were eclipsed by the announcement that the entertainment giant would be ending its distribution agreement with streaming major Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). Disney plans to create its own streaming services, whereby Disney and Pixar films would be streamed on its own subscription service, including sports content through its ESPN franchise.It’s a novel approach for Disney to shore up its content for the future. Near term, the market doesn’t like it: DIS shares are down nearly 6% in today’s pre-market. But in the longer term, perhaps the Netflix, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other streaming models are the right way to go for the company.

1387,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 9, before the market opens. The company’s performance has been mixed so far, having topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and in missing once. The company has delivered an average positive surprise of 1.33% in the trailing four quarters.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.09%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We note that shares of Mylan have gained 1.2% year to date against the industry‘s 0.4% dip.Factors to Consider This QuarterConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings call, Mylan stated that it expects revenues between $12.25 and $13.75 billion in 2017. The company projects earnings in the range of $5.15–$5.55 per share for 2017.Newly launched products are likely to perform well and aid the top line, while the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business are anticipated to continue to boost the topline in the generics segment. Pricing continues to impact results and the company projects mid-single digit price erosion globally for the year for the base business in the U.S. The biosimilars pipeline continues to progress well. The FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recently unanimously recommended approval of Mylan's biosimilar version of Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug Herceptin.However, Mylan’s Specialty segment, of which EpiPen is the most significant product, continues to be weak. In Dec 2016, Mylan announced the launch of the authorized generic for EpiPen Auto-Injector at a wholesale acquisition cost of $300 per epinephrine injection USP two-pack, which is more than 50% lower than the WAC of EpiPen 2-Pak Auto-Injectors. Sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector are anticipated to continue to decline in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch. Mylan stated that EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America in 2017.  Meanwhile, the company’s efforts to get Advair’s generic approved suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its ANDA for generic Advair Diskus.During the earnings call, we expect investors to focus on the performance of EpiPen, newly launched drugs and progress with the biosimilars pipeline.Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Mylan N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Mylan N.V. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mylan is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

1388,MYL,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) will be reporting second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 3, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings.This generic drug maker’s shares have lost 10.8% so far this year, while the industry witnessed an increase of 0.3%.Teva’s earnings have surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters and met the same in the remaining two, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe that the inclusion of sales from Actavis Generics acquisition may continue to pull up Teva’s sales.However, its generic segment may continue seeing weakness. The segment will remain under pressure due to pricing erosion as well as competitive pressure.Meanwhile, in the Specialty segment, loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone, Azilect and Nuvigil will hurt sales. Sales of blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Copaxone are likely to erode due to increased competition. Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, entered the market in Jun 2015.Teva is also facing patent challenges for the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. Companies like Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and Momenta are looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone. Teva suffered a major setback in Jan 2017 with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating four out of five Orange Book patents for Copaxone 40 mg. Teva intends to appeal against the decision. There is uncertainty regarding the timing of the generic launch of Copaxone 40mg. It is possible that certain competitors may receive FDA approval and launch before the appeal decision is out.However, generic versions of the 40 mg formulation have not been launched yet. The FDA approval of Momenta’s generic version of Copaxone has been delayed owing to manufacturing issues.At the first quarter call, the company had mentioned that earnings growth will be weighted toward the second half as the company expects the majority of the US generic launches to occur only in the second half of 2017. This implies that profits in the second quarter may not improve much from the weakness seen in the first quarter.Nonetheless, Teva’s focus on its cost reduction program may give its profits a boost.In April, Teva announced FDA approval of Austedo (SD-809) for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). We expect management to update on the commercialization plans for the same.Teva also continues to search for a permanent CEO, which remains the company’s “highest priority”. At the first quarter call, chairman Sol Barer had said that the company is looking for a top-notch CEO with “deep and broad pharmaceutical experience”. We expect an update on the CEO search at the upcoming conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.06 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Teva’sZacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the generics drug sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company (MNK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Aug 8.

1389,MYL,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 50 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported loss was, however, wider than the year-ago loss of 31 cents.Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRevenues in the quarter improved 10.8% to $23.6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.9 million.Momenta’s stock has rallied 6.3% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 9.9%. Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top line comprises product revenues of $19.1 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $20.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales deductions in the second quarter of 2016, as well as legal reimbursement in the second quarter of 2017.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $4.4 million, down from $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in revenues was mainly due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, effective Dec 31, 2016.While, research and development expenses were up to $39.1 million from $33.2 million, general and administrative expenses increased 52% to $22.6 million.Outlook UpdatedMomenta now expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $210–$230 million, compared with the previous guidance of $200–$240 million in 2017. The guidance also includes approximately $55 million of capital expenditure on M923. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 are projected around $50–$60 million.Momenta expect to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) as upfront payment on a quarterly basis. In Jul 2017, Momenta earned a $10 million milestone payment from Sandoz as Glatopa 20 mg continues to be the sole FDA-approved generic of Copaxone 20 mg.Pipeline UpdateSandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in Feb 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter. The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. Currently, Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Moving ahead, the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, it expects first commercial launch of M923 to be as early as the 2020 timeframe.The company completed enrolment in the phase I study on M834, a biosimilar version of Orencia (abatacept) in Apr 2017 under its collaboration with Mylan. Top-line data from the study are expected in the second half of 2017.Furthermore, Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes: M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. In Jan 2017, the company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with CSL for M230 and potential future Fc multimer programs. The candidate is expected to enter clinic in 2017.Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in Jan 2017 (expected to be completed in Aug 2017) and data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study are projected in the second half of 2017.Our TakeMomenta’s loss per share came in line with estimates in the second quarter of 2017 while sales beat estimates. The ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval. We expect the warning letter will remain a drag on the company's shares till the issue is solved.Nevertheless, sales of Glatopa 20mg continue to do well. Glatopa 20mg has captured approximately 40% of the market in the U.S. In addition, a potential approval of M923 will boost investor confidence.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1391,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) reported core earnings of 70 cents per American depositary share in the second quarter of 2017, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents by almost 3%.Earnings were however down 2% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER), driven by a negative impact of settlement of intercompany transaction during the quarter.So far this year, Glaxo’s shares have gained 5.6%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 10.7%.Quarterly revenues were up 3% at CER to $9.42 billion (£7.3 billion) on the back of strong performances by all the business segments. However, revenue marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.52 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at CER.Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 5% in the U.S. and 1% in International markets. Also, sales in Europe registered a growth rate of 2%.Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products were up 47% driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq; respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala; vaccines to prevent meningitis, and drugs like Bexsero and Menveo.Glaxo reports results under three segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare.The Pharmaceuticals division registered revenue growth of 3% driven by HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq, and respiratory disease drugs, Relvar/Breo and Nucala. This was partly offset by the impact of recent divestments on Established Pharmaceuticals.HIV sales were up 17% on 24% growth in the U.S. and 27% in International sales. Europe sales were however flat year over year. The encouraging numbers came on the back of continued market share growth for both Triumeq (sales up 44%) and Tivicay (sales up 37%). However, sales of another HIV drug Epzicom/Kivexa tumbled 63% due to an increased generic competition, particularly affecting the European market.Respiratory sales increased 4% on the back of 7% growth in both the U.S. and 5% in the international markets. In Europe, however, respiratory sales slid 2% as the portfolio continued to transition to newer products including Relvar/Breo Ellipta.Sales of new respiratory products like Relvar/Breo Ellipta, Anoro Ellipta, Arnuity Ellipta and Nucala offset the decline in Seretide/Advair sales (down 14%). Flixotide/Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 1% and 8% respectively.The Ellipta products recorded a 73% surge in sales, driven by market share gains with the global roll-out continuing.Immuno-inflammation drugs, which include Benlysta, rose 9% in the quarter.The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals includes the previous Established Products, Cardiovascular, metabolic and urology (CVMU) and other Pharma products. Established Pharmaceuticals sales were down 7% in the quarter.However, sales were flat in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions. Sales were hurt by the disposal of the Nigeria beverages business in 2016, challenging conditions in some emerging markets, particularly India, and a weaker allergy performance in the U.S. However, the power brands, particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories saw a strong performance in the quarter.Sales from the Vaccines segment were up 5%. Geographically, the U.S. was up 12%, Europe was up 10% whereas international markets were down 5%. Sales benefited from a continued uptake of meningitis vaccines, Bexsero globally and Menveo in the international markets. The segment also experienced a strong performance of the Established Vaccines, driven by higher demand for Boostrix and Hepatitis vaccines, particularly.OutlookThe company expects to face a generic competition for Advair in the U.S. which will affect the top line. However, there is uncertainty regarding the timing of launch of a generic version of the drug. With no generic version of Advair expected to be launched in 2017, the company expects core 2017 earnings growth of 3-5% at CER, lower than 5-7%, projected previously.Additionally, during the second quarter, the company decided to invest in a Priority Review Voucher to accelerate the FDA’s review for its two drug regimen in HIV. This investment decision along with other accelerated launch cost, related with the HIV drugs, led to the lowered profit guidance.We remind investors that Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) efforts to bring a generic version for Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Advair in April, thereby delaying the entry of the generic. Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’s generic version of Advair was also denied an approval by the FDA in May 2017. A generic version of Advair is therefore not likely to be approved of this year.Glaxo expects an approval for Shingrix in the U.S. and Europe, besides Closed Triple in the fourth quarter of 2017. Hence, these products should generate a significant sales figure only in 2018.Long Term OutlookGlaxo expects its adjusted EPS growth through 2020 to be in the range of mid-to-high single digits. During the period, the company plans to stop development of pre-clinical and clinical programmes and instead, shift the pipeline focus to Respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases’ therapeutic areas, where the company already enjoys a strong presence. Also, the company will make R&D investments in two potentially fast-growing therapeutic areas - Oncology and Immuno-inflammation. Its cost-reduction initiatives would lead additional £1 billion annual cost savings by 2020.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGlaxoSmithKline PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksGlaxo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1392,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26 before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings.Glaxo’s shares are up 10.1% this year so far, underperforming the 11.9% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Glaxo’s performance has been pretty good so far, with the company’s earnings beating expectations thrice in the four trailing quarters while meeting estimates in the remaining quarter. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.28%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAll of its business segments – Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare – are expected to do well in the to-be reported quarter.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. Sales of newly launched respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala are expected to offset the declines in Seretide, Advair and Avodart. Many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Importantly, pricing dynamics and competitive pressure are hurting sales of its top-selling drug Advair in the US while generic competition is hurting Advair sales in Europe.At the first quarter call, the company had mentioned a lot of uncertainty surrounding the timing of Advair generic launch. However, Mylan N.V.’s (MYL  -  Free Report) efforts to bring a generic version for Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) in Apr 2017, thereby delaying the entry of the generic. Hikma Pharmaceuticals’ generic version of Advair was also denied approval by the FDA in May 2017. A generic version of Advair is therefore not likely to be approved this year.The Vaccines segment will continue to benefit from the uptake of meningitis vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo (acquired from Novartis).Importantly, growth of the Consumer Healthcare segment has slowed down. At the first quarter conference call, management had mentioned that the impact of general sales tax and continued slowdown in the nutrition category in India, challenging economic conditions in some other international markets and the Nigerian beverage business divestment are expected to hurt Consumer Healthcare segment sales this year. These factors might impact second-quarter results.However, cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies are likely to boost operating profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Glaxo is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -1.45% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 68 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 69 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Glaxo’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise  GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteStock to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the large cap pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1393,MYL,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner, Biocon Ltd. announced that the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) unanimously recommended approval of its biosimilarversion of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab).In fact, the FDA’s ODAC voted 16 to 0 in favor of biosimilar candidate, which has been developed to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that is a more aggressive form of the disease.Notably, shares of Mylan inched up about 0.41% following the news release. However, the company has outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical-Generic Drugs industry in the year so far, with the stock gaining 2.8% against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Meanwhile, the data presented to ODAC included results that showed that the proposed biosimilar trastuzumab is highly similar to Herceptin, in line with the FDA’s assessment provided in the pre-meeting briefing documents. Per ODAC, there is no clinically meaningful difference between Mylan’s biosimilar candidate and Herceptin in terms of safety, purity and potency.Biosimilar trastuzumab is also under review by regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, Europe and several emerging markets.While this is good news for Mylan, it is a blow for Roche because Herceptin is one of its key drugs. Last week, another biosimilar of Roche was put under review by the ODAC. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner, Allergan plc. (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its candidate, ABP 215, a biosimilar to Roche’s another cancer  drug Avastin, will also be reviewed by ODAC.  Both Herceptin and AVastin are key drugs for Roche and biosimiar versions of these drugs, once approved, will hurt the sales of the drugs. Mylan N.V.

1394,MYL,"It was a busy week for the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) which reviewed several experimental treatments this week including Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) CAR-T cell drug. Meanwhile, French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced it will be acquiring a vaccines company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Panel Supports Novartis Car-T Drug: Novartis got a huge boost with an FDA advisory panel voting unanimously in favor of the company’s experimental CAR-T cell therapy CTL019. Novartis is looking to get the treatment approved for pediatric, young adult relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The positive vote is a major milestone for the company which could become the first to launch a CAR-T cell therapy if the FDA follows the advisory panel’s advice. CTL019 is currently under priority review in the U.S. -- with the advisory panel issuing a positive recommendation, we believe chances of gaining approval are high (Read more: Novartis CAR-T Therapy Drug Recommended by FDA Panel).So far in 2017, Novartis has outperformed the Zacks categorized Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry with shares gaining 13.3% while the industry is up 11.3%.FDA Nod for J&J Psoriasis Treatment: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya gained FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This makes the drug the first and only biologic approved that selectively blocks only IL-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. Although the psoriasis market is pretty crowded, Tremfya demonstrated superior results in skin clearance compared with Humira in head-to-head analyses at weeks 16, 24 and 48.Tremfya is currently in a late-stage study for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis and a phase III program evaluating its efficacy compared with Cosentyx in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Mar 2018 PDUFA Date for Pfizer’s Xeljanz Label Expansion: Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) sNDA for Xeljanz has been accepted for review by the FDA with a response expected in Mar 2018. Timely approval would make Xeljanz the first oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to be available for people living with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).Pfizer also got a favorable vote from the FDA’s advisory panel for its acute myeloid leukemia (AML) drug, Mylotarg, for newly-diagnosed patients. A final decision from the FDA should be out by Sep 2017. Mylotarg was initially approved in 2000 but was subsequently withdrawn from the market after a late-stage study failed to show a clinical benefit. Moreover, a higher rate of fatalities resulting from treatment-related toxicity was observed in the Mylotarg arm.Priority Review for Lilly’s Advanced Breast Cancer Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) got priority review from the FDA for its CDK 4 & 6 inhibitor abemaciclib. The company is looking to get abemaciclib approved as monotherapy and combination therapy (with fulvestrant) for patients with advanced breast cancer. Given the priority review status, Lilly should get a response from the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. Currently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitors include Pfizer’s Ibrance and Novartis’ Kisqali (Read more: Lilly's Breast Cancer Drug Gets Priority Review Status by FDA).Lilly also entered into a settlement agreement with generic players to settle patent infringement lawsuits related to the Cialis (tadalafil) unit dose patent. With the settlement agreement, the patent, which was previously set to expire on Apr 26, 2020, will now end on Sep 27, 2018. Cialis is approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and the frustrating urinary symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Cialis sales were $2.5 billion in 2016.Lilly said that the Adcirca (tadalafil) patent will remain protected until Nov 21, 2017, or May 21, 2018, if pediatric exclusivity is granted. Adcirca is approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (Read more: Lilly Settles Patent Litigation on Cialis with Generic Firms).Sanofi to Buy Vaccines Company for Up To $750M: Sanofi, which failed in its efforts to acquire Medivation and Actelion, announced that it will be acquiring Protein Sciences, a U.S.-based privately held vaccines biotech company, for up to $750 million. This includes an upfront payment of $650 million and up to $100 million on the achievement of certain milestones.  With this acquisition, Sanofi is looking to expand its flu portfolio with the addition of a non-egg based vaccine. Protein Sciences’ Flublok Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV), which was approved by the FDA in Oct 2016, is the only recombinant protein-based flu vaccine approved by the agency. The acquisition is scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2017.  Sanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar Gets Favorable Panel Vote: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) got a boost with its biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) getting a favorable recommendation from an FDA advisory panel. The panel voted 16-0 in support of eligible indications of the reference product which include HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. The biosimilar version has been developed under a collaboration with Biocon.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.4% over the last five trading sessions.

1395,MYL,"The healthcare sector is in the spotlight again due to exorbitant drug pricing. President Donald Trump, in a tweet on Monday, criticized pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for its recent price increases of several prescription drugs.Last week, the New York based company announced an increase in list prices of several drugs. This is the second time this year that Pfizer has increased prices of its medicines. Pfizer raised prices of its medicines by an average of 9% which is within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, prices of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the January hike.Pfizer defended the price rise by stating that the list price does not reflect the actual price, which includes a discount. It also mentioned that it has hiked prices of only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.Pfizer’s announcement of the price hike came only a few weeks after Trump’s claim in May that pharma companies would soon take massive price cuts voluntarily. However, there have been no signs of such price cuts.Pfizer faced criticism for the price hikes as there is a concern that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in drug prices by other pharma bigwigs like Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), J&J and others.In his latest tweet, Trump warned that the administration will act in response and Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they have raised drug prices for “no reason.” The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies are offering “bargain basement prices” overseas.Pricing Controversy a Lingering Issue?The healthcare industry has always been in the spotlight for high drug prices. The sector, previously a Wall Street favorite, was hit hard by political rhetoric and increasing media and public focus on the high prices of drugs. The drug pricing controversy has grabbed headlines since September 2015 when several companies were criticized for overpricing drugs. These included Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), which increased the price of EpiPen, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report), for its strategy of acquiring companies and selling their drugs at higher prices.Trump, during his election campaign, had pledged to take steps to lower prescription drug prices and ensure affordability of high-cost drugs. However, no concrete policy changes have been announced to decrease drug prices since Trump took office.To ConcludeThough the industry has been constantly warned by Trump to keep prices of drugs affordable, it is probably not doing anything about it. On his part, the President can take several steps in this direction. He can push for faster generic - cheaper “copycat” versions of the branded drugs – approval, which he is already doing. He can also ask for discounted rebates to be disclosed, put limitations on promotions/advertisements of the drugs, and   mandate Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturers.It is high time drug companies take steps to provide relief to consumers by keeping cost of medicines affordable. Until then, the drug pricing controversy will remain an overhang on the space.Though Pfizer’s shares did take a dip after Trump’s tweet, it closed the day in the green.Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1396,MYL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Mylan N.V. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Mylan N.V.’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 11.2) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 9.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Mylan N.V. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 6.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Mylan N.V.’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Mylan N.V. has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Mylan N.V. currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes MYL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Mylan N.V. is just 1.1, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 4.6, which is way better than the industry average of 14.8. Clearly, MYL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Mylan N.V. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives ODP a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and four lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward and five downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has slipped 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMylan N.V. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 19% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1397,MYL,"Shares of Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP  -  Free Report) surged 50% after the company announced that it entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement for its Symjepi (epinephrine) with Swiss pharma giant Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz.Terms of the AgreementPer the agreement, Sandoz will own the commercial rights to Symjepi in the United States, in exchange for an upfront fee and potential performance-based milestone payments. Both companies will share the profits equally. We note that Symjepi Injection 0.3 mg was approved by the FDA in 2017 for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Sandoz will also get commercial rights for Symjepi Injection 0.15mg, upon approval, as the product is under FDA review for now. On the other hand, Adamis will retain the right to commercialize both products in territories outside the United States. Sandoz, however, gets the first right of negotiation for such territories.Adamis also has the option to develop Symject injection platform for additional product candidates, including the naloxone product candidate being developed to treat opioid overdose.How Will Adamis Gain?Adamis will get Novartis as a strong commercial partner, given the latter’s dominant position in the pharmaceutical market. Moreover, the financial terms of the agreement are favorable for Adamis, as it will get an upfront fee and milestone payments.We remind investors that Symjepi competes with Mylan‘s (MYL  -  Free Report) EpiPen, and Adamis had been on the lookout for a commercial partner, for long. Earlier in 2016, Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) had terminated its license agreement to commercialize the product, which was then not approved by the FDA.Hence, the agreement with Novartis bodes well for Adamis. The news boosted investors’ sentiment as well. Adamis’ stock gained 9.1% in the year so far, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.9%. On the other hand, the addition of Symjepi will further expand Sandoz’s existing portfolio, given the market potential of epinephrine.Zacks RankAdamis currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(MYL  -  Free Report) and India-based Lupin Limited have entered into a partnership to commercialize a biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel (etanercept).Per the partnership agreement, Mylan will commercialize Lupin's proposed biosimilar in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and most markets throughout Asia.We note Enbrel is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. According to IQVIA, brand sales of approximately $11.6 billion for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2017.Lupin successfully completed its phase III trial, etanercept, in Feb 2018.

The company had earlier won FDA approval of Ogivri, a biosimilar of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin.On the other hand, agreement with Mylan bodes well for Lupin given the former’s significant expertise and global infrastructure. Mylan’s stock has lost 11.5% in the year so far compared with the industry's gain of 0.8%.

The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018.

1399,MYL,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (RDY  -  Free Report) and Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the first generic version of a Suboxone (Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film) under-the-tongue film for the treatment of opioid addiction. Both the companies will sell the generic version of the drug. Per the FDA, the approval was aimed at making the treatment available to more people.Buprenorphine and naloxone are used to treat adults with opioid dependence/addiction. Buprenorphine helps to suppress withdrawal symptoms caused by discontinuation of opioid drugs, and naloxone reverses and blocks the effect of opioids.The Suboxone brand had U.S. sales of approximately $1.86 billion MAT for the most recent twelve months ending in April 2018 according to IMS Health.Shares of Dr. Reddy have decreased 12% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 2.4%.Last month, Indivior PLC entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies Inc., Endo International PLC (collectively, “Par”) and IntelGenx Technologies Corp., resolving patent litigation related to Suboxone Sublingual Film.The litigation was pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and resulted from Par’s submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Suboxone Film. The settlement permitted Par to begin selling a generic version of Suboxone Film on Jan 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances.We note that, Dr. Reddy’s enjoys a strong position in the generics market.

1400,MYL,"GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) HIV company, ViiV Healthcare announced that the two late-stage studies testing its two-drug HIV regimen of dolutegravir (Tivicay) and lamivudine (Epivir) met the primary endpoint.The two phase III studies, GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2, evaluated the two-drug regimen in treatment naïve - those who have not received prior antiviral therapy -  HIV-1 infected adults compared to a three-drug regimen of dolutegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate and emtricitabine. The studies demonstrated that the dolutegravir and lamivudine regimen was non-inferior to the standard three-drug regimen in HIV control. This means a two-drug HIV regimen can control HIV in treatment-naïve patients as effectively as a three-drug regimen.Shares of Glaxo were up almost 2% on Thursday in response to the positive news. This year so far, Glaxo’s shares have gained 18.2% against the industry’s decline of 4.2%. Shares of Glaxo also received a boost this week as Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) application to get approval for a generic version of Glaxo’s blockbuster respiratory drug, Advair was rejected for the second time by the FDA. Full results from the studies will be presented at a future medical meeting. Regulatory application to get the two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine approved are expected to be filed later this year.Glaxo has several phase III studies ongoing evaluating two-drug regimens for HIV-1 treatment. These studies, conducted across global research centers, include approximately 1,400 HIV infected men and women.The two-drug regimens reduce the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen, thereby reducing long-term toxicity concerns.Juluca is Glaxo’s first and the only approved two-drug regimen. It gained approval in EU last month and in the United States in November last year. It generated sales of £10 million in the first quarter of 2018. Glaxo has developed Juluca in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report). Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs — Glaxo’s Tivicay/dolutegravir(50 mg) and J&J’s Edurant/rilpivirine(25 mg) — into a single, once-daily pill for the treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection.ViiV Healthcare is an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo.

(MYL  -  Free Report) are down after the company announced that the FDA will not approve its Abbreviated New Drug Application for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK  -  Free Report) asthma drug, Advair Diskus, yet again.The agency found minor deficiencies in the application, which will be relayed to the company in a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to be issued on June 27, 2018.The news comes as a disappointment for Mylan. Last year, the FDA had issued a CRL for it, as well. A probable approval would have boosted Mylan’s generic portfolio immensely, given the potential market for the same.The CRL also puts a question mark on Mylan’s 2018 guidance and the company is expected to update on the same.Mylan’s stock has gained 4.2% in the last six months compared with the industry’s gain of 3.9%. After a challenging 2017, things were looking up for Mylan in 2018 with recent approvals, which are expected to help the company combat the persistent decline in EpiPen sales.Mylan’s biosimilar portfolio got a boost with the recent FDA approval of Fulphila, a biosimilar of Neulasta. The company had earlier won the FDA approval of Ogivri, a biosimilar of Herceptin.Earlier, Mylan received a major boost with the FDA approval for a generic version of Teva’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40mg. Being one of the first filers, it will also enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018.Hence, the approval of generic Advair would have further propelled the company’s broad portfolio of biosimilars and generics.Meanwhile, Mylan is not the only company whose ANDA has been rejected by the FDA. Earlier in 2018, Swiss pharma giant Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm Sandoz also got a CRL from the FDA for its generic version of Advair. Sandoz is in the process of addressing the issues identified in the CRL and it does not expect to launch the generic before 2019 end. Hikma Pharmaceuticals also received a CRL from the FDA in 2017 for its generic version of Advair.On the other hand, the delay in approval of generic version of Advair bodes well for Glaxo. Concurrent with the first-quarter results, Glaxo stated that it expects Advair sales of around £750 million in 2018, assuming a mid-year introduction of a substitutable generic competitor to Advair in the United States. Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1403,MYL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MYL due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Mylan Q1 Earnings Lag on Weak North America SalesMylan reported disappointing results for the first-quarter as earnings and sales both missed estimates.Adjusted earnings of $0.96 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.99 but was up from $0.93 in the year-ago quarter.First-quarter revenues of $2.68 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78 billion and were down 1% from the prior-year period.Quarter in DetailThe company posts results in three segments on a geographic basis namely North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment’s third-party net sales came in at $985.3 million, down 19% due to a decrease in the sales of branded products, including EpiPen Auto-Injector, the impact of the loss of exclusivity of olmesartan and olmesartan HCTZ and the prior-year divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets.Sales were adversely impacted due to the implementation of new accounting standards along with lower volumes, and to a lesser extent, pricing, on other existing products partially offset by new product introductions.Third-party net sales from Europe were $1.04 billion, up 16%. This was propelled by new product introductions across the region combined with volume expansion which offset the impact of pricing on existing products.  Favorable foreign currency translation positively impacted sales by 14%.Rest of World segment’s third-party net sales of $626.7 million was up 8%, driven by new products and increased volume from the anti-retroviral franchise and higher sales in the emerging markets.Adjusted gross margin of 52.9% was down from 53.5% in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, Mylan repurchased 9.8 million ordinary shares for $432.0 million completing the previously authorized share repurchase program.2018 Outlook ReiteratedMylan expects revenues of $11.75-$13.25 billion in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $12.45 billion. Mylan anticipates adjusted EPS of around $5.20-$5.60 in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.35.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus  Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MYL has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, MYL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1405,MYL,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) issued a statement in response to a letter from public shareholders from Appaloosa and Senator Investment Group of the company expressing disappointment on the recently announced strategic plan to divest the women's health and infectious disease units.Activist investors Tepper from Appaloosa and Douglas Silverman from Senator Investment Group and have requested to split Brent Saunders' responsibilities, who is currently the chairman as well as the chief executive officer (“CEO”). They suggested recruiting a new chairman or CEO who is not from the company, replacement of two additional board members and changes to management of critical operating units. They are of the view that the company needs fresh ideas. They believe the above changes are required to drive returns or else share prices will continue to decline.In its statement, the company stated that its board and management are open to inputs from all shareholders and considers the same while making decisions. They are focused on building a world class company and drive return for shareholders.On its earnings call held in May, Allergan management discussed several strategic plans including divestment and share buybacks. The company recently concluded its strategic review and announced that it will focus on its leading four therapeutic areas – medical aesthetics, CNS, eye care and GI – and will divest the two units mentioned above. In January, the company cut jobs as part of a restructuring process.Moreover, Allergan also mentioned that the board has been refreshed with the addition of three members in the last 16 months.Meanwhile, the shareholders have rejected the proposal of splitting the role of Brent and appointment of an independent chairman during the annual general meeting held in May.So far this year, Allergan’s share price has declined 7% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.4%.We note that Allergan recorded strong earnings in the first quarter and also announced successful results from clinical studies. However, its shares are declining as several of its key products are facing loss of exclusivity, which may have an unfavorable impact on the top line.Restasis, a major revenue contributor, is facing stiff competition with the launch of Shire plc’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) dry eye disease drug Xiidra last year. Its sales have declined more than 17% in the first quarter. A generic version of the drug may also be launched by mid-2018. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (SGYP  -  Free Report) Trulance, which was approved for chronic idiopathic constipation last year is expected to increase competition for Linzess. Several companies are looking to bring generic version of the drug in the market. Moreover, in January, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched the generic version of Estrace vaginal cream, which saw sales erosion of more than 90% in the first quarter.The company estimated that the products losing exclusivity were worth $3 billion in 2017.

1406,MYL,"Mylan N.V (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon announced that the FDA has approved Fulphila, a biosimilar of Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta.The news comes as a significant boost for Mylan, given the potential market for Fulphilia. According to the IQVIA, Neulasta generated U.S. sales of $4.2 billion for the twelve months ending Mar 31, 2018.The biosimilar has been approved to reduce the duration of febrile neutropenia (fever or other signs of infection with a low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells) in patients treated with chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.Notably, this is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Neulasta. The company plans to launch the biosimilar in the coming weeks.The approval will broaden Mylan’s biosimilars portfolio. The FDA approval was based on a comprehensive package of analytical, nonclinical and clinical data, which confirmed that the biosimilar is highly similar to the branded drug. The data demonstrated that there were no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and Neulasta in terms of safety, purity and potency.Both the companies had earlier won FDA approval for Ogivri, a biosimilar of Herceptin. The biosimilar is also approved for 30 additional countries. Mylan and Biocon are collaborating to develop 11 biologic and insulin products. While Mylan owns the commercialization rights for the product in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and European Free Trade Association countries, Biocon has co-exclusive commercialization rights with Mylan for the product in the rest of the world. In March 2018, Mylan and Biocon announced that their co-developed biosimilar insulin glargine Semglee has obtained approval from the European Commission (EC) following the positive recommendation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of European Medicines Agency.We note that Mylan has one of the widest portfolios of generics and biosimilars. The company has a portfolio of 20 bioismilar and insulin analog products.Mylan’s stock has gained 11.5% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. Shares are trading up on the news.Mylan’s efforts to develop its biosimilars portfolio is impressive.

The trial will be a randomized, double-blind, active-control, multicenter study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with the reference drug. Eylea, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema.Although volatility in the United States markets is expected to continue in 2018, yet these new approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help it combat the decline in EpiPen sales.Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1407,MYL,"After declining sharply in 2017, shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) have picked up pace this year so far. The stock has risen 17% against the industry’s decline of 5.8%.What’s Going in Teva’s Favor?The Israel-based generic drug maker has been facing significant challenges. This includes accelerated generic competition for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone; new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business and a massive debt load of more than $30 billion. Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone in October last year was a major setback for Teva. In the same month, Mylan also launched the second generic version of the 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. The first generic version of the 20 mg formulation has been marketed by Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz — Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm — since 2015With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation (Glatopa) was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than its scheduled launch in April.However, Teva has undertaken some strategic and restructuring initiatives to revive growth.The company divested some non-core assets last year (mainly in the Women’s Health business) to cut its significant debt load. It also has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December. Teva is progressing well on these re-structuring activities and still expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives.Its financial position also seems more stable than before as it is regularly paying down debt.Earlier this month, Teva announced its first-quarter 2018 results, beating expectations for both earnings and sales while also raising its full-year outlook for both the metricsThe stock also got an impetus recently, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it has doubled its investment in the company in the first quarter. Berkshire said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts (ADRs) at the end of March, up from 18.9 million ADRs at the end of 2017.Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 increased a respective 9.5% and 4% over the past 30 days.Teva currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1408,MYL,"Cambridge, MA-based Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) is currently facing challenging business conditions.It operates in three areas — Complex Generics, Biosimilars and Novel Therapeutics.The company markets Glatopa, a generic version of Teva’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Copaxone (20 mg), in collaboration with Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Sandoz. Glatopa is the first substitutable generic drug approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RRMS).  Offering major relief to investors, the FDA finally approved Sandoz's Abbreviated New Drug Application for Glatopa 40 mg in February 2018, after initial setbacks.However, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) won the FDA’s approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals Copaxone 40 mg earlier than Momenta. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL, containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company already has an upper hand in the market which shall make it difficult for Momenta to gain market share.  While Sandoz is still in the early phases of the launch, Mylan launched its generic equivalents of once-daily Copaxone 20 mg/mL and three-times-weekly Copaxone 40 mg/mL in October 2017.  As a result, the market and contractual profit share revenue of Glatopa 20 mg/mL has been reduced by an accelerated conversion of patients from once-daily 20 mg/mL glatiramer acetate injection to three-times-weekly 40 mg/mL glatiramer acetate injection due to lower pricing in that market. At the end of 2017, Teva’s three-times-weekly Copaxone 40 mg/mL and Mylan N.V.’s three-times-weekly generic equivalent product accounted for approximately 82% of the overall U.S. glatiramer acetate injection market (20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) based on volume prescribed.While the progress with the biosimilars pipeline has been encouraging, Momenta suffered another setback when the company and partner Mylan announced that M834, a proposed biosimilar for Orencia, did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers.The Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of Humira, is also ready to be filed with the FDA.  However, the filing of the BLA is dependent on the outcome of the company’s ongoing strategic review.We note that given the recent setbacks, Momenta initiated a strategic review of its ongoing operations with the goal of reducing expenditure on its biosimilar portfolio, which should free up additional capital to fully fund its novel autoimmune portfolio. The company does not have the runway to develop the broad portfolio it created barring the revenue stream from Glatopa, without excessive dilution for its investors.

1409,MYL,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) shot up around 5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after it was revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) has doubled its investment in the company in the first quarterBerkshire said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts (ADRs) at the end of March, up from 18.9 million ADRs at the end of 2017. The changes were reflected in a regulatory filing by Berkshire on Tuesday.What Attracted Buffett to Teva?The big question now is what led Buffett to increase stake in the Israel-based generic drugmaker, which has been facing significant challenges. This includes accelerated generic competition for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone; new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business and a massive debt load of more than $30 billion. Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) earlier-than-expected launch of the first generic version of the 40-mg strength of Copaxone in October was a major setback for Teva. In the same month, Mylan also launched the second generic version of the 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. The first generic version of the 20 mg formulation has been marketed by Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MNTA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz — Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm — since 2015With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation (Glatopa) was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than its scheduled launch in April.However, Teva has undertaken some strategic and restructuring initiatives to revive growth.The company divested some non-core assets last year (mainly in the Women’s Health business) to cut its significant debt load. It also has a new organizational structure in place, is closing plants, cutting down its generics portfolio, eliminating low-value R&D projects, and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December last year. Teva is progressing well on these re-structuring activities and still expects to save almost $3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives.Its financial position also seems more stable than before as it is regularly paying down debt.Earlier this month, Teva announced its first-quarter 2018 results, beating expectations for both earnings and sales while also raising its full-year outlook for both the metricsNumbers in Favor of TevaAfter declining sharply in 2017, Teva’s shares have also picked up this year. The stock has risen 7.1% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 7.5%.Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 increased a respective 7.4% and 2.1% over the past 30 days.The stock also trades at an attractive valuation as evident from its favorable P/E, P/S and P/B ratios compared to the generics industry.Its median P/E F12M (forward twelve months) for the past year is 6.72X, which is a discount to the stock’s high of P/E F12M of 8.96X in the same time frame. The stock also trades at a discount to the generic industry’s P/E F12M of 9.89X, which shows that the stock has the potential to grow further.Similarly, the median level trailing-12-month price to sales (P/S) ratio for Teva is 0.84 for the past year, a discount to 1.82 for the industry.Teva currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1410,MYL,"Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) reported disappointing results for the first-quarter as earnings and sales both missed estimates.Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus Mylan N.V. Price and Consensus | Mylan N.V. QuoteAdjusted earnings of 96 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents but was up from 93 cents in the year-ago quarter.First-quarter revenues of $2.68 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78 billion and were down 1% from the prior-year period.Mylan’s stock has lost 7.3% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 6.0%. Quarter in DetailThe company posts results in three segments on a geographic basis namely North America, Europe and Rest of World.North America segment’s third-party net sales came in at $985.3 million, down 19% due to a decrease in the sales of branded products, including EpiPen Auto-Injector, the impact of the loss of exclusivity of olmesartan and olmesartan HCTZ and the prior-year divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets.Sales were adversely impacted due to the implementation of new accounting standards along with lower volumes, and to a lesser extent, pricing, on other existing products partially offset by new product introductions.Third-party net sales from Europe were $1.04 billion, up 16%. This was propelled by new product introductions across the region combined with volume expansion which offset the impact of pricing on existing products.  Favorable foreign currency translation positively impacted sales by 14%.Rest of World segment’s third-party net sales of $626.7 million was up 8%, driven by new products and increased volume from the anti-retroviral franchise and higher sales in the emerging markets.Adjusted gross margin of 52.9% was down from 53.5% in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, Mylan repurchased 9.8 million ordinary shares for $432.0 million completing the previously authorized share repurchase program.2018 Outlook ReiteratedMylan expects revenues of $11.75-$13.25 billion in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $12.45 billion. Mylan anticipates adjusted EPS of around $5.20-$5.60 in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.35.Our TakeMylan’s first-quarter results were dismal as challenges in North America persist.  The generic business in the United States continues to experience pricing pressure. Loss of exclusivity on olmesartan products also impacted sales.Nevertheless, things are likely to look up in the long run. Mylan has already won an FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals’ (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone 40 mg. Notably, this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved. Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection, 40 mg/mL containing a Paragraph IV certification, the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity. The company also received an FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin.Although volatility in the U.S. market is expected to persist in 2018, yet these approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help combat the decline in EpiPen sales. The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018. The launch of generic version of Estrace cream is also underway.Key anticipated approvals also include a biosimilar version of Neulasta with a target action date in June 2018. The company expects to launch the biosimilar in the second half assuming approval. The EMA has also accepted applications for both the biosimilars. Mylan and partner Momenta (MNTA  -  Free Report) will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710 — a proposed biosimilar of ophthalmology drug Eylea — in the first half of 2018.Zacks RankMylan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1411,MYL,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 loss of $1.22 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29 and the year-ago loss of $1.27.Total revenues in the quarter surged 169.5% year over year to $8.3 million. This upside can mainly be attributed to amortization of the upfront fees related to a global development and commercialization agreement with Janssen, subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), for TD-1473. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 million.Theravance shares were up 3.4% on May 8, following the earnings release. However, shares have underperformed the industry in a year’s time.

The increase in expenses was due to higher employee-related costs and stock-based compensation.Pipeline and Other UpdatesIn February 2018, Theravance entered into a global collaboration agreement with Janssen to jointly develop and commercialize its pan-Janus kinase inhibitor, TD-1473, for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases.  A phase II study and a phase IIb/III study are likely to be initiated in the second half of 2018 to evaluate TD-1473 in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively.In January, Theravance along with partner Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the new drug application (""NDA"") for pipeline candidate, revefenacin (TD-4208), has been accepted by the FDA for treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A response from the regulatory body is expected on Nov 13, 2018. The company is preparing for the commercial launch of the drug upon potential approval.The company’s collaboration partner Alfasigma for velusetrag (TD-5108) opted-in to acquire rights to the candidate. Per the opt-in decision, global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize velusetrag will be transferred to Alfasigma for $10 million upfront fees and future milestone payments and royalties. Theravance has decided not to pursue further development of velusetrag as part of its pipeline strategy.2018 Outlook ReiteratedTheravance continues to expect operating loss, excluding non-cash share-based compensation, for 2018 in the range of $180-$200 million.Theravance Biopharma, Inc.

1412,MYL,"New economic data has been released today’s pre-market, with the inflation gauge metric Producer Price Index (PPI) hitting the tape. Results were more tepid than expected: +0.1% for the month of April, down from the estimated +0.2-0.3% and the March read of +0.3%. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, this number reached +0.2%, and +2.3% year over year.Between the PPI and its sister survey, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out tomorrow ahead of the opening bell, these metrics are illustrative regarding how far and how fast inflation is seeping into the U.S. economy. After the March numbers, which were a bitter hotter than expected, market analysts suspected we may be at the precipice of rampant inflation, but today’s numbers mute this notion.Over time we tend to see the picture more clearly, but for now, expectations that the Fed will need to act more aggressively raising interest rates are not being ignited. Again, we look toward tomorrow’s CPI numbers to complete this picture.Boeing to Lose $20B on Iran Deal PulloutWith President Trump announcing an end to the Obama-era nuclear non-proliferation deal with Iran — removing the U.S. from the agreement still supported by other members Germany, France, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union as a whole — reports this morning on the world’s biggest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), are not good. Boeing stands to lose $20 billion for a contract to produce 110 new planes for Irani airline companies, mostly Iran Air.The company will have either 90 or 180 days to sever the agreement with Iran, which will likely also be subject to renewed sanctions imposed by the U.S. There will reportedly be penalties for failing to do so, but these have yet to be determined. France-based Airbus will also be affected, according to reports, as will aircraft parts producer General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings Activity Stays HeavyThough most of the marquee names on the S&P 500 have already reported earnings in calendar Q1 2018, the amount of companies reporting remains very high. After today’s market close we expect results from firms like 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), Roku (ROKU  -  Free Report) and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF  -  Free Report), and ahead of the bell we have already seen results from the following:Anheuser Busch/InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed earnings report this morning, with 73 cents per share missing the Zacks consensus of 79 cents and down a penny from the year-ago quarter, but $13.1 billion in sales surpassed the expected $12.8 billion.
